some years mind how long little or no money in my purse and nothing particular to interest me on shore i thought i would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world
it is a way i have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation
whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth whenever it is a damp november in my soul whenever i find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses and bringing up the rear of every funeral i meet and especially whenever my get such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and methodically knocking peoples hats i account it high time to get to sea as soon as i can

surely all this is not without meaning
and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it and was drowned
but that same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans
it is the image of the phantom of life and this is the key to it all
now when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be over conscious of my lungs i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as a passenger
for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it
besides passengers get sleep of not enjoy themselves much as a general i never go as a passenger nor though i am something of a salt do i ever go to sea as a commodore or a captain or a cook
i the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them
for my part i all honourable respectable toils trials and tribulations of every kind whatsoever
it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself without taking care of ships barques brigs schooners and what not
and as for going as i confess there is considerable glory in that a cook being a sort of officer on somehow i never fancied once broiled judiciously buttered and salted and peppered there is no one who will speak more respectfully not to say reverentially of a broiled fowl than i will
it is out of the idolatrous of the old egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge the pyramids
no when i go to sea i go as a simple sailor right before the mast plumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal masthead
true they rather order me about some and make me jump from spar to spar like a grasshopper in a may meadow
and at first this sort of thing is unpleasant enough
it touches ones sense of honour particularly if you come of an old established family in the land the van rensselaers or randolphs or
and more than all if just previous to putting your hand into the you have been it as a country schoolmaster making the tallest boys stand in awe of you
the transition is a keen one i assure you from a schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of seneca and the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it
but even this wears off in time
what of it if some old hunks of a orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks
what does that indignity amount to weighed i mean in the scales of the new testament
do you think the archangel gabriel thinks anything the less of me because i promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance
who aint a slave
tell me that
well then however the old may order me they may thump and punch me about i have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same in a physical or metaphysical point of view that is and so the universal thump is passed round and all hands should rub each others and be content
again i always go to sea as a sailor because they make a point of paying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that i ever heard of
on the contrary passengers themselves must pay
and there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid
the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us
but being will compare with it
the urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills and that on no account can a man enter heaven
ah
how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition
finally i always go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck
for as in this world head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern that is if you never violate the pythagorean maxim so for the most part the commodore on the quarterdeck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle
he thinks he breathes it first but not so
in much the same way do the lead their leaders in many other things at the same time that the leaders little suspect it
but wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage this the invisible police officer of the fates who has the constant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me and influences me in some unaccountable can better answer than any one else
and doubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand programme of providence that was drawn up a long time ago
it came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances
i take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this grand contested election for the presidency of the united states
whaling voyage by one ishmael
bloody battle in
though i cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers the fates put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies and short and easy parts in genteel comedies and jolly parts in i cannot tell why this was exactly yet now that i recall all the circumstances i think i can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises induced me to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment
chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself
such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity
then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk the nameless perils of the whale these with all the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds helped to sway me to my wish
with other men perhaps such things would not have been inducements but as for me i am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote
i love to sail forbidden seas and land on barbarous coasts
not ignoring what is good i am quick to perceive a horror and could still be social with they let it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in
by reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome the great floodgates of the swung open and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into my inmost soul endless processions of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air
chapter 2
the
i stuffed a shirt or two into my old tucked it under my arm and started for cape horn and the pacific
quitting the good city of old i duly arrived in new bedford
it was a saturday night in december
much was i disappointed upon learning that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reaching that place would offer till the following monday
as most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same new bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may as well be related that i for one had no idea of so doing
for my mind was made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft because there was a fine boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island which amazingly pleased me
besides though new bedford has of late been gradually the business of whaling and though in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her yet nantucket was her great tyre of this place where the first dead american whale was stranded
where else but from nantucket did those aboriginal the redmen first sally out in canoes to give chase to the leviathan
and where but from nantucket too did that first adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with imported goes the throw at the whales in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit
now having a night a day and still another night following before me in new bedford ere i could embark for my destined port it became a matter of where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile
it was a very nay a very dark and dismal night cold and
i knew no one in the place
with anxious i had sounded my pocket and only brought up a few pieces of wherever you go ishmael said i to myself as i stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night my dear ishmael be sure to inquire the price and be too particular
with halting steps i paced the streets and passed the sign of the crossed it looked too expensive and jolly there
further on from the bright red windows of the swordfish inn there came such fervent rays that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard weary for me when i struck my foot against the flinty projections because from hard remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight
too expensive and jolly again thought i pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within
but go on ishmael said i at last you hear
get away from before the door your patched boots are stopping the way
so on i went
i now by instinct followed the streets that took me for there doubtless were the cheapest if not the inns
such dreary streets
blocks of blackness not houses on either hand and here and there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb
at this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of the town proved all but deserted
but presently i came to a smoky light proceeding from a low wide building the door of which stood open
it had a careless look as if it were meant for the uses of the public so entering the first thing i did was to stumble over an in the porch
ha
thought i ha as the flying particles almost choked me are these ashes from that destroyed city gomorrah
but the crossed harpoons and the swordfish
this then must needs be the sign of the trap
however i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within pushed on and opened a second interior door
it seemed the great black parliament sitting in
a hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black angel of doom was beating a book in a pulpit
it was a negro church and the preachers text was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and there
ha ishmael muttered i backing out wretched entertainment at the sign of the trap
moving on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray and these words coffin
ominous in that particular connexion thought i
but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i suppose this peter here is an emigrant from there
as the light looked so dim and the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district and as the swinging sign had a sort of creak to it i thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings and the best of pea coffee
it was a queer sort of old house one side as it were and leaning over sadly
it stood on a sharp bleak corner where that tempestuous wind kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor pauls tossed craft
nevertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one indoors with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed
in judging of that tempestuous wind called says an old whose works i possess the only copy maketh a marvellous difference whether thou out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside or whether thou it from that window where the frost is on both sides and of which the wight death is the only glazier
true enough thought i as this passage occurred to my blackletter thou well
yes these eyes are windows and this body of mine is the house
what a pity they didnt stop up the and the crannies though and thrust in a little lint here and there
but its too late to make any improvements now
the universe is finished the is on and the chips were carted off a million years ago
poor lazarus there chattering his teeth against the for his pillow and shaking off his tatters with his he might plug up both ears with rags and put a corncob into his mouth and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous

says old dives in his red silken had a redder one afterwards pooh pooh
what a fine frosty night how orion glitters what northern lights
let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals
but what thinks lazarus
can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights
would not lazarus rather be in sumatra than here
would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator yea ye gods
go down to the fiery pit itself in order to keep out this frost
now that lazarus should lie stranded there on the before the door of dives this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the moluccas
yet dives himself he too lives like a czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and being a president of a temperance society he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans
but no more of this now we are going and there is plenty of that yet to come
let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet and see what sort of a place this may be
chapter 3
the
entering that you found yourself in a wide low straggling entry with reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft
on one side hung a very large so thoroughly and every way defaced that in the unequal by which you viewed it it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of the neighbors that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose
such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new england hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched
but by dint of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however wild might not be altogether unwarranted
but what most puzzled and confounded you was a long limber portentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue dim perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast
a boggy soggy picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distracted
yet was there a sort of indefinite unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant
ever and anon a bright but alas deceptive idea would dart you the black sea in a midnight the unnatural combat of the four primal a blasted a winter the of the icebound stream of time
but at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the pictures midst
that once found out and all the rest were plain
but stop does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish
even the great leviathan himself
in fact the artists design seemed this a final theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom i conversed upon the subject
the picture represents a in a great hurricane the ship there with its three dismantled masts alone visible and an exasperated whale to spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mastheads
the opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a array of monstrous clubs and spears
some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted with knots of human hair and one was with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the grass by a mower
you as you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a with such a hacking horrifying implement
mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed
some were storied weapons
with this once long lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago did nathan swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset
and that like a corkscrew flung in javan seas and run away with by a whale years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco
the original iron entered nigh the tail and like a restless needle in the body of a man travelled full forty feet and at last was found imbedded in the hump
crossing this dusky entry and on through yon through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all enter the public room
a still place is this with such low ponderous beams above and such old wrinkled planks beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old crafts cockpits especially of such a howling night when this old ark rocked so furiously
on one side stood a long low table covered with cracked glass cases filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide worlds remotest nooks
projecting from the further angle of the room stands a bara rude attempt at a right whales head
be that how it may there stands the vast arched bone of the whales jaw so wide a coach might almost drive beneath it
within are shabby shelves ranged round with old bottles flasks and in those jaws of swift destruction like another cursed jonah by which name indeed they called him bustles a little withered old man who for their money dearly sells the sailors and death
abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison
though true cylinders the green glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom
parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass surround these goblets
fill to this mark and your charge is but a penny to this a penny more and so on to the full cape horn measure which you may gulp down for a shilling
upon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about a table examining by a dim light divers specimens of
i sought the landlord and telling him i desired to be accommodated with a room received for answer that his house was a bed unoccupied
but avast he added tapping his forehead you no objections to sharing a blanket have ye
i you are goin so youd better get used to that sort of thing
i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if i should ever do so it would depend upon who the might be and that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night i would put up with the half of any decent mans blanket
i thought so
all right take a seat
want supper
be ready directly
i sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the battery
at one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jackknife stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs
he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail but he didnt make much headway i thought
at last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room
it was cold as fire at landlord said he couldnt afford it
nothing but two dismal tallow candles each in a winding sheet
we were fain to button up our monkey jackets and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers
but the fare was of the most substantial only meat and potatoes but dumplings good heavens
dumplings for supper
one young fellow in a green box coat addressed himself to these dumplings in a most manner
my boy said the landlord youll have the nightmare to a dead
landlord i whispered that aint the is it
oh no said he looking a sort of funny the is a dark chap
he never eats dumplings he eats nothing but steaks and he likes em rare
the devil he does says i
where is that
is he here
hell be here afore long was the answer
i could not help it but i began to feel suspicious of this dark
at any rate i made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get into bed before i did
supper over the company went back to the barroom when knowing not what else to do with myself i resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on
presently a rioting noise was heard without
starting up the landlord cried thats the crew
i seed her reported in the offing this morning a three years voyage and a full ship
hurrah boys now well have the latest news from the
a tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry the door was flung open and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough
enveloped in their shaggy watch coats and with their heads muffled in woollen all and ragged and their beards stiff with icicles they seemed an eruption of bears from labrador
they had just landed from their boat and this was the first house they entered
no wonder then that they made a straight wake for the whales the wrinkled little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out all round
one complained of a bad cold in his head upon which jonah mixed him a potion of gin and molasses which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and whatsoever never mind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast of labrador or on the weather side of an
the liquor soon mounted into their heads as it generally does even with the newly landed from sea and they began about most
i observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest
this man interested me at once and since the had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a one so far as this narrative is concerned i will here venture upon a little description of him
he stood full six feet in height with noble shoulders and a chest like a cofferdam
i have seldom seen such brawn in a man
his face was deeply brown and burnt making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy
his voice at once announced that he was a southerner and from his fine stature i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the ridge in virginia
when the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height this man slipped away unobserved and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea
in a few minutes however he was missed by his shipmates and being it seems for some reason a huge favourite with them they raised a cry of bulkington
bulkington
wheres bulkington
and darted out of the house in pursuit of him
it was now about nine oclock and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies i began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen
no man prefers to sleep two in a bed
in fact you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother
i know how it is but people like to be private when they are sleeping
and when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange town and that stranger a then your objections indefinitely multiply
nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should sleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea than bachelor kings do ashore
to be sure they all sleep together in one apartment but you have your own hammock and cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin
the more i pondered over this the more i the thought of sleeping with him
it was fair to presume that being a his linen or woollen as the case might be would not be of the certainly none of the finest
i began to twitch all over
besides it was getting late and my decent ought to be home and going
suppose now he should tumble in upon me at could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming
landlord
ive changed my mind about that shant sleep with him
ill try the bench here
just as you please im sorry i cant spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress and its a rough board of the knots and notches
but wait a bit ive got a carpenters plane there in the i say and ill make ye snug enough
so saying he procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench vigorously set to planing away at my bed the while grinning like an ape
the shavings flew right and left till at last the came bump against an indestructible knot
the landlord was near spraining his wrist and i told him for heavens sake to bed was soft enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank
so gathering up the shavings with another grin and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room he went about his business and left me in a brown study
i now took the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot too short but that could be mended with a chair
but it was a foot too narrow and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed there was no them
i then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall leaving a little interval between for my back to settle down in
but i soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the night
the devil fetch that thought i but stop couldnt i steal a march on his door inside and jump into his bed not to be by the most violent
it seemed no bad idea but upon second thoughts i dismissed it
for who could tell but what the next morning so soon as i popped out of the room the might be standing in the entry all ready to knock me down
still looking round me again and seeing no possible chance of spending a night unless in some other persons bed i began to think that after all i might be cherishing prejudices against this unknown
thinks i ill wait awhile he must be dropping in before long
ill have a good look at him then and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after no telling
but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones twos and threes and going to bed yet no sign of my
landlord
said i what sort of a chap is he always keep such late hours
it was now hard upon twelve oclock
the landlord again with his lean chuckle and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension
no he answered generally hes an early to bed and to hes the bird what catches the worm
but tonight he went out a peddling you see and i see what on keeps him so late unless may be he cant sell his head
cant sell his sort of a story is this you are telling me
getting into a towering rage
do you pretend to say landlord that this is actually engaged this blessed saturday night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head around this town
thats precisely it said the landlord and i told him he couldnt sell it here the markets
with what
shouted i
with heads to be sure aint there too many heads in the world
i tell you what it is landlord said i quite calmly youd better stop spinning that yarn to not green
may be not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick but i guess youll be brown if that ere hears you a his head
ill break it for him said i now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlords
its broke said he
broke said do you mean
sartain and thats the very reason he cant sell it i guess
landlord said i going up to him as cool as mt
hecla in a stop whittling
you and i must understand one another and that too without delay
i come to your house and want a bed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half belongs to a certain
and about this whom i have not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my sort of connexion landlord which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree
i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this is and whether i shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him
and in the first place you will be so good as to that story about selling his head which if true i take to be good evidence that this is stark mad and ive no idea of sleeping with a madman and you sir you i mean landlord you sir by trying to induce me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution
wall said the landlord fetching a long breath thats a long for a chap that rips a little now and then
but be easy be easy this here i have been you of has just arrived from the south seas where he bought up a lot of new zealand heads great curios you know and hes sold all on em but one and that one hes trying to sell tonight cause tomorrows sunday and it would not do to be sellin human heads about the streets when folks is goin to churches
he wanted to last sunday but i stopped him just as he was goin out of the door with four heads strung on a string for all the like a string of
this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling at the same time what could i think of a who stayed out of a saturday night clean into the holy sabbath engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators
depend upon it landlord that is a dangerous man
he pays was the rejoinder
but come its getting dreadful late you had better be turning a nice bed sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced
theres plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed its an almighty big bed that
why afore we give it up sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it
but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night and somehow sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his arm
arter that sal said it wouldnt do
come along here ill give ye a in a jiffy and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me offering to lead the way
but i stood when looking at a clock in the corner he exclaimed i its wont see that tonight hes come to anchor along then do come wont ye come
i considered the matter a moment and then up stairs we went and i was ushered into a small room cold as a clam and furnished sure enough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four to sleep abreast
there said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a and centre table there make yourself comfortable now and good night to ye
i turned round from eyeing the bed but he had disappeared
folding back the i stooped over the bed
though none of the most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well
i then glanced round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf the four walls and a papered representing a man striking a whale
of things not properly belonging to the room there was a hammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a large seamans bag containing the wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk
likewise there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fireplace and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed
but what is this on the chest
i took it up and held it close to the light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it
i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an indian moccasin
there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat as you see the same in south american ponchos
but could it be possible that any sober would get into a door mat and parade the streets of any christian town in that sort of guise
i put it on to try it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and thick and i thought a little damp as though this mysterious had been wearing it of a rainy day
i went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall and i never saw such a sight in my life
i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck
i sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this and his door mat
after thinking some time on the bedside i got up and took off my monkey jacket and then stood in the middle of the room thinking
i then took off my coat and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves
but beginning to feel very cold now half undressed as i was and remembering what the landlord said about the not coming home at all that night it being so very late i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself to the care of heaven
whether that mattress was stuffed with or broken crockery there is no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a long time
at last i slid off into a light doze and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod when i heard a heavy footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door
lord save me thinks i that must be the the infernal
but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word till spoken to
holding a light in one hand and that identical new zealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and without looking towards the bed placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room
i was all eagerness to see his face but he kept it averted for some time while employed in the bags mouth
this accomplished however he turned good heavens
what a sight
such a face
it was of a dark purplish yellow colour here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares
yes its just as i thought hes a terrible hes been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he is just from the surgeon
but at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light that i plainly saw they could not be at all those black squares on his cheeks
they were stains of some sort or other
at first i knew not what to make of this but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me
i remembered a story of a white mana falling among the cannibals had been tattooed by them
i concluded that this in the course of his distant voyages must have met with a similar adventure
and what is it thought i after all
its only his outside a man can be honest in any sort of skin
but then what to make of his unearthly complexion that part of it i mean lying round about and completely independent of the squares of tattooing
to be sure it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but i never heard of a hot suns tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one
however i had never been in the south seas and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin
now while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning this never noticed me at all
but after some difficulty having opened his bag he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk and a sealskin wallet with the hair on
placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room he then took the new zealand ghastly thing crammed it down into the bag
he now took off his hata new beaver i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise
there was no hair on his to speak of at but a small twisted up on his forehead
his bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a skull
had not the stranger stood between me and the door i would have bolted out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner
even as it was i thought something of slipping out of the window but it was the second floor back
i am no coward but what to make of this purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension
ignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger i confess i was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night
in fact i was so afraid of him that i was not game enough just then to address him and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him
meanwhile he continued the business of undressing and at last showed his chest and arms
as i live these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face his back too was all over the same dark squares he seemed to have been in a thirty years war and just escaped from it with a shirt
still more his very legs were marked as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms
it was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a in the south seas and so landed in this christian country
i to think of it
a peddler of heads the heads of his own brothers
he might take a fancy to
look at that tomahawk
but there was no time for shuddering for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen
going to his heavy or or dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he fumbled in the pockets and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back and exactly the colour of a three days old congo baby
remembering the embalmed head at first i almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner
but seeing that it was not at all limber and that it a good deal like polished ebony i concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol which indeed it proved to be
for now the savage goes up to the empty fireplace and removing the papered sets up this little hunchbacked image like a tenpin between the
the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty so that i thought this fireplace made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his congo idol
i now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image feeling but ill at ease see what was next to follow
first he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his pocket and places them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze
presently after many hasty snatches into the fire and still withdrawals of his fingers whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit then blowing off the heat and ashes a little he made a polite offer of it to the little negro
but the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lips
all these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee who seemed to be praying in a or else singing some pagan psalmody or other during which his face about in the most unnatural manner
at last extinguishing the fire he took the idol up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock
all these queer proceedings increased my and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations and jumping into bed with me i thought it was high time now or never before the light was put out to break the spell in which i had so long been bound
but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say was a fatal one
taking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head of it for an instant and then holding it to the light with his mouth at the handle he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke
the next moment the light was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth sprang into bed with me
i sang out i could not help it now and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me
stammering out something i knew not what i rolled away from him against the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he might be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again
but his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning
you
he at last no damme i and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark
landlord for gods sake peter coffin
shouted i
landlord
watch
coffin
angels
save me

me be or damme i
again growled the cannibal while his horrid of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen would get on fire
but thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him
be afraid now said he grinning again here wouldnt harm a hair of your head
stop your grinning shouted i and why didnt you tell me that that infernal was a cannibal
i thought ye i tell ye he was a heads around turn flukes again and go to sleep
look me i this man
me puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed
you in he added to me with his tomahawk and throwing the clothes to one side
he really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way
i stood looking at him a moment
for all his he was on the whole a clean comely looking cannibal
whats all this fuss i have been making about thought i to mans a human being just as i am he has just as much reason to fear me as i have to be afraid of him
better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian
landlord said i tell him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or whatever you call it tell him to stop smoking in short and i will turn in with him
but i fancy having a man smoking in bed with me
its dangerous
besides i aint insured
this being told to he at once complied and again politely motioned me to get into over to one side as much as to sayi wont touch a leg of ye
good night landlord said i you may go
i turned in and never slept better in my life
chapter 4
the
upon waking next morning about daylight i found arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner
you had almost thought i had been his wife
the was of patchwork full of odd little squares and triangles and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure no two parts of which were of one precise i suppose to his keeping his arm at sea in sun and shade his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various same arm of his i say looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt
indeed partly lying on it as the arm did when i first awoke i could hardly tell it from the quilt they so blended their hues together and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that i could tell that was hugging me
my sensations were strange
let me try to explain them
when i was a child i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me whether it was a reality or a dream i never could entirely settle
the circumstance was this
i had been cutting up some caper or think it was trying to crawl up the chimney as i had seen a little sweep do a few days previous and my stepmother who somehow or other was all the time whipping me or sending me to bed mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed though it was only two oclock in the afternoon of the 21st june the longest day in the year in our hemisphere
i felt dreadfully
but there was no help for it so up stairs i went to my little room in the third floor undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets
i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before i could hope for a resurrection
sixteen hours in bed
the small of my back to think of it
and it was so light too the sun shining in at the window and a great rattling of coaches in the streets and the sound of gay voices all over the house
i felt worse and last i got up dressed and softly going down in my feet sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself at her feet beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an length of time
but she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers and back i had to go to my room
for several hours i lay there broad awake feeling a great deal worse than i have ever since even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes
at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and slowly waking from steeped in opened my eyes and the before sunlit room was now wrapped in outer darkness
instantly i felt a shock running through all my frame nothing was to be seen and nothing was to be heard but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine
my arm hung over the and the nameless unimaginable silent form or phantom to which the hand belonged seemed closely seated by my bedside
for what seemed ages piled on ages i lay there frozen with the most awful fears not daring to drag away my hand yet ever thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would be broken
i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me but waking in the morning i remembered it all and for days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery
nay to this very hour i often puzzle myself with it
now take away the awful fear and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to those which i experienced on waking up and seeing pagan arm thrown round me
but at length all the past nights events soberly recurred one by one in fixed reality and then i lay only alive to the comical predicament
for though i tried to move his his bridegroom sleeping as he was he still hugged me tightly as though naught but death should part us twain
i now strove to rouse
but his only answer was a snore
i then rolled over my neck feeling as if it were in a and suddenly felt a slight scratch
throwing aside the there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savages side as if it were a baby
a pretty pickle truly thought i abed here in a strange house in the broad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk
the name of goodness wake
at length by dint of much wriggling and loud and incessant upon the of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style i succeeded in extracting a grunt and presently he drew back his arm shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in bed stiff as a looking at me and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him
meanwhile i lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgivings now and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature
when at last his mind seemed made up touching the character of his and he became as it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out upon the floor and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that if it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards leaving the whole apartment to myself
thinks i under the circumstances this is a very civilized overture but the truth is these savages have an innate sense of delicacy say what you will it is marvellous how essentially polite they are
i pay this particular compliment to because he treated me with so much civility and consideration while i was guilty of great rudeness staring at him from the bed and watching all his toilette motions for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding
nevertheless a man like you see every day he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding
he commenced dressing at top by his beaver hat a very tall one by the by and minus his hunted up his boots
what under the heavens he did it for i cannot tell but his next movement was to crush in hand and hat the bed when from sundry violent and i inferred he was hard at work booting himself though by no law of propriety that i ever heard of is any man required to be private when putting on his boots
but do you see was a creature in the transition caterpillar nor butterfly
he was just enough civilized to show off his in the strangest possible manners
his education was not yet completed
he was an undergraduate
if he had not been a small degree civilized he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all but then if he had not been still a savage he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on
at last he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes and began creaking and limping about the room as if not being much accustomed to boots his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide not made to order pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning
seeing now that there were no curtains to the window and that the street being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room and observing more and more the figure that made staving about with little else but his hat and boots on i begged him as well as i could to accelerate his toilet somewhat and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible
he complied and then proceeded to wash himself
at that time in the morning any christian would have washed his face but to my amazement contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest arms and hands
he then his waistcoat and taking up a piece of hard soap on the centre table dipped it into water and commenced his face
i was watching to see where he kept his razor when lo and behold he takes the harpoon from the bed corner slips out the long wooden stock the head it a little on his boot and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall begins a vigorous scraping or rather of his cheeks
thinks i this is using rogerss best cutlery with a vengeance
afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept
the rest of his toilet was soon achieved and he proudly marched out of the room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket and sporting his harpoon like a marshals baton
chapter 5
breakfast
i quickly followed suit and descending into the barroom accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly
i cherished no malice towards him though he had been with me not a little in the matter of my
however a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a good thing the mores the pity
so if any one man in his own proper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not be backward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way
and the man that has anything laughable about him be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for
the barroom was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous and whom i had not as yet had a good look at
they were nearly all chief mates and second mates and third mates and sea carpenters and sea coopers and sea blacksmiths and and ship keepers a brown and brawny company with beards an shaggy set all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns
you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore
this young fellows healthy cheek is like a pear in hue and would seem to smell almost as musky he cannot have been three days landed from his indian voyage
that man next him looks a few shades lighter you might say a touch of satin wood is in him
in the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic but slightly bleached withal he doubtless has whole weeks ashore
but who could show a cheek like
which barred with various tints seemed like the andes western slope to show forth in one array contrasting climates zone by zone
grub ho
now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in we went to breakfast
they say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at ease in manner quite in company
not always though ledyard the great new england traveller and mungo park the scotch one of all men they possessed the least assurance in the parlor
but perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as ledyard did or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negro heart of africa which was the sum of poor mungos kind of travel i say may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish
still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had anywhere
these reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table and i was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling to my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence
and not only that but they looked embarrassed
yes here were a set of many of whom without the slightest had boarded great whales on the high strangers to duelled them dead without winking and yet here they sat at a social breakfast of the same calling all of kindred round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains
a curious sight these bashful bears these timid warrior
but as for sat there among the head of the table too it so chanced as cool as an icicle
to be sure i cannot say much for his breeding
his greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him and using it there without ceremony reaching over the table with it to the imminent jeopardy of many heads and grappling the towards him
but that was certainly very coolly by him and every one knows that in most peoples estimation to do anything coolly is to do it
we will not speak of all peculiarities here how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls and applied his undivided attention to rare
enough that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room lighted his and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when i sallied out for a stroll
chapter 6
the street
if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as circulating among the polite society of a civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of new bedford
in thoroughfares nigh the docks any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the looking nondescripts from foreign parts
even in broadway and chestnut streets mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the ladies
regent street is not unknown to lascars and malays and at bombay in the apollo green live yankees have often scared the natives
but new bedford beats all water street and wapping
in these haunts you see only sailors but in new bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners savages outright many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh
it makes a stranger stare
but besides the and and besides the wild specimens of the which unheeded reel about the streets you will see other sights still more curious certainly more comical
there weekly arrive in this town scores of green vermonters and new hampshire men all for gain and glory in the fishery
they are mostly young of stalwart frames fellows who have felled forests and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the
many are as green as the green mountains whence they came
in some things you would think them but a few hours old
look there
that chap strutting round the corner
he wears a beaver hat and coat girdled with a and
here comes another with a and a cloak
no dandy will compare with a mean a downright bumpkin fellow that in the will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands
now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation and joins the great you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport
in his he orders to his waistcoats straps to his canvas
ah poor hayseed
how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale when thou art driven straps buttons and all down the throat of the tempest
but think not that this famous town has only cannibals and to show her visitors
not at all
still new bedford is a queer place
had it not been for us that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of labrador
as it is parts of her back country are enough to frighten one they look so bony
the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in in all new england
it is a land of oil true enough but not like canaan a land also of corn and wine
the streets do not run with milk nor in the springtime do they pave them with fresh eggs
yet in spite of this nowhere in all america will you find more houses parks and gardens more opulent than in new bedford
whence came they
how planted upon this once scoria of a country
go and gaze upon the iron harpoons round yonder lofty mansion and your question will be answered
yes all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the atlantic pacific and indian oceans
one and all they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea
can herr alexander perform a feat like that
in new bedford fathers they say give whales for to their daughters and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises apiece
you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding for they say they have reservoirs of oil in every house and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles
in summer time the town is sweet to see full of fine avenues of green and gold
and in august high in air the beautiful and bountiful proffer the passerby their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms
so omnipotent is art which in many a district of new bedford has bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creations final day
and the women of new bedford they bloom like their own red roses
but roses only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens
elsewhere match that bloom of theirs ye cannot save in salem where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore as though they were drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of the sands
chapter 7
the chapel
in this same new bedford there stands a chapel and few are the moody fishermen shortly bound for the indian ocean or pacific who fail to make a sunday visit to the spot
i am sure that i did not
returning from my first morning stroll i again sallied out upon this special errand
the sky had changed from clear sunny cold to driving sleet and mist
wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin i fought my way against the stubborn storm
entering i found a small scattered congregation of sailors and sailors wives and widows
a muffled silence reigned only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm
each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other as if each silent grief were insular and
the chaplain had not yet arrived and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets with black borders into the wall on either side the pulpit
three of them ran something like the following but i do not pretend to quote sacred to the memory of john talbot who at the age of eighteen was lost overboard near the isle of desolation off patagonia november 1st 1836
this tablet is erected to his memory by his sister
sacred to the memory of robert long willis ellery nathan coleman walter canny seth macy and samuel forming one of the boats crews of the ship eliza who were towed out of sight by a whale on the offshore ground in the pacific december 31st 1839
this marble is here placed by their surviving shipmates
sacred to the memory of the late captain ezekiel hardy who in the bows of his boat was killed by a sperm whale on the coast of japan august 3d 1833
this tablet is erected to his memory by his widow
shaking off the sleet from my hat and jacket i seated myself near the door and turning sideways was surprised to see near me
affected by the solemnity of the scene there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance
this savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance because he was the only one who could not read and therefore was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall
whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation i knew not but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief that i feel sure that here before me were assembled those in whose hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh
oh
ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass who standing among flowers can here lies my beloved ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these
what bitter blanks in those marbles which cover no ashes
what despair in those immovable inscriptions
what deadly voids and infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all faith and refuse resurrections to the beings who have perished without a grave
as well might those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta as here
in what census of living creatures the dead of mankind are included why it is that a universal proverb says of them that they tell no tales though containing more secrets than the goodwin sands how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world we prefix so significant and infidel a word and yet do not thus entitle him if he but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth why the life insurance companies pay upon immortals in what eternal paralysis and deadly hopeless trance yet lies antique adam who died sixty round centuries ago how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss why all the living so strive to hush all the dead wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city
all these things are not without their meanings
but faith like a jackal feeds among the tombs and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope
it needs scarcely to be told with what feelings on the eve of a nantucket voyage i regarded those marble tablets and by the murky light of that darkened doleful day read the fate of the who had gone before me
yes ishmael the same fate may be thine
but somehow i grew merry again
delightful inducements to embark fine chance for promotion it a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet
yes there is death in this business of quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity
but what then
we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death
that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance
that in looking at things spiritual we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air
my body is but the lees of my better being
in fact take my body who will take it i say it is not me
and therefore three cheers for nantucket and come a stove boat and stove body when they will for stave my soul jove himself cannot
chapter 8
the pulpit
i had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered immediately as the door flew back upon admitting him a quick eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain
yes it was the famous father so called by the among whom he was a very great favourite
he had been a sailor and a in his youth but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry
at the time i now write of father was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth for among all the fissures of his wrinkles there shone certain mild of a newly developing spring verdure peeping forth even beneath februarys snow
no one having previously heard his history could for the first time behold father without the utmost interest because there were certain clerical peculiarities about him to that adventurous maritime life he had led
when he entered i observed that he carried no umbrella and certainly had not come in his carriage for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed
however hat and coat and were one by one removed and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner when arrayed in a decent suit he quietly approached the pulpit
like most old fashioned pulpits it was a very lofty one and since a regular stairs to such a height would by its long angle with the floor seriously contract the already small area of the chapel the architect it seemed had acted upon the hint of father and finished the pulpit without a stairs substituting a perpendicular side ladder like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea
the wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted for this ladder which being itself nicely headed and stained with a mahogany colour the whole contrivance considering what manner of chapel it was seemed by no means in bad taste
halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the father cast a look upwards and then with a truly but still reverential dexterity hand over hand mounted the steps as if ascending the of his vessel
the perpendicular parts of this side ladder as is usually the case with swinging ones were of rope only the rounds were of wood so that at every step there was a joint
at my first glimpse of the pulpit it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary
for i was not prepared to see father after gaining the height slowly turn round and stooping over the pulpit deliberately drag up the ladder step by step till the whole was deposited within leaving him impregnable in his little quebec
i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this
father enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage
no thought i there must be some sober reason for this thing furthermore it must symbolize something unseen
can it be then that by that act of physical isolation he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time from all outward worldly ties and connexions
yes for replenished with the meat and wine of the word to the faithful man of god this pulpit i see is a lofty ehrenbreitstein with a perennial well of water within the walls
but the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place borrowed from the chaplains former
between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers
but high above the flying scud and clouds there floated a little isle of sunlight from which beamed forth an angels face and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ships tossed deck something like that silver plate now inserted into the victorys plank where nelson fell
ah noble ship the angel seemed to say beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardy helm for lo
the sun is breaking through the clouds are rolling azure is at hand
nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same that had achieved the ladder and the picture
its panelled front was in the likeness of a ships bluff bows and the holy bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work fashioned after a ships beak
what could be more full of the pulpit is ever this earths foremost part all the rest comes in its rear the pulpit leads the world
from thence it is the storm of gods quick wrath is first and the bow must bear the earliest brunt
from thence it is the god of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds
yes the worlds a ship on its passage out and not a voyage complete and the pulpit is its prow
chapter 9
the sermon
father rose and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense
starboard gangway there
side away to gangway to starboard
midships
midships
there was a low rumbling of heavy among the benches and a still slighter shuffling of womens shoes and all was quiet again and every eye on the preacher
he paused a little then kneeling in the pulpits bows folded his large brown hands across his chest uplifted his closed eyes and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea
this ended in prolonged solemn tones like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a such tones he commenced reading the following hymn but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas burst forth with a exultation and joy the ribs and terrors in the whale arched over me a dismal gloom while all gods sunlit waves rolled by and lift me deepening down to doom
i saw the opening maw of hell with endless pains and sorrows there which none but they that feel can tell oh i was plunging to despair
in black distress i called my god when i could scarce believe him mine he bowed his ear to my complaints no more the whale did me confine
with speed he flew to my relief as on a radiant dolphin borne awful yet bright as lightning shone the face of my deliverer god
my song for ever shall record that terrible that joyful hour i give the glory to my god his all the mercy and the power
nearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above the howling of the storm
a brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the bible and at last folding his hand down upon the proper page said beloved shipmates clinch the last verse of the first chapter of god had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah
shipmates this book containing only four one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures
yet what depths of the soul does jonahs deep sound
what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet
what a noble thing is that canticle in the fishs belly
how and grand
we feel the floods surging over us we sound with him to the bottom of the waters seaweed and all the slime of the sea is about us
but what is this lesson that the book of jonah teaches
shipmates it is a lesson a lesson to us all as sinful men and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living god
as sinful men it is a lesson to us all because it is a story of the sin suddenly awakened fears the swift punishment repentance prayers and finally the deliverance and joy of jonah
as with all sinners among men the sin of this son of was in his wilful disobedience of the command of mind now what that command was or how he found a hard command
but all the things that god would have us do are hard for us to hence he commands us than endeavors to persuade
and if we obey god we must disobey ourselves and it is in this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obeying god consists
with this sin of disobedience in him jonah still further at god by seeking to flee from him
he thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where god does not reign but only the captains of this earth
he about the wharves of joppa and seeks a ship thats bound for tarshish
there lurks perhaps a hitherto unheeded meaning here
by all accounts tarshish could have been no other city than the modern cadiz
thats the opinion of learned men
and where is cadiz shipmates
cadiz is in spain as far by water from joppa as jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days when the atlantic was an almost unknown sea
because joppa the modern jaffa shipmates is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean the syrian and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that just outside the straits of gibraltar
see ye not then shipmates that jonah sought to flee worldwide from god
miserable man
oh
most contemptible and worthy of all scorn with hat and guilty eye skulking from his god prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas
so disordered is his look that had there been policemen in those days jonah on the mere suspicion of something wrong had been arrested ere he touched a deck
how plainly hes a fugitive
no baggage not a valise or friends accompany him to the wharf with their
at last after much dodging search he finds the tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo and as he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods to mark the strangers evil eye
jonah sees this but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence in vain essays his wretched smile
strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent
in their but still serious way one whispers to the hes robbed a widow or joe do you mark him hes a bigamist or harry lad i guess hes the adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah or one of the missing murderers from sodom
another runs to read the bill thats stuck against the upon the wharf to which the ship is moored offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide and containing a description of his person
he reads and looks from jonah to the bill while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round jonah prepared to lay their hands upon him
jonah trembles and summoning all his boldness to his face only looks so much the more a coward
he will not confess himself suspected but that itself is strong suspicion
so he makes the best of it and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised they let him pass and he descends into the cabin
whos there
cries the captain at his busy desk hurriedly making out his papers for the there
oh
how that harmless question mangles jonah
for the instant he almost turns to flee again
but he rallies
i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon sail ye sir
thus far the busy captain had not looked up to jonah though the man now stands before him but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing glance
we sail with the next coming tide at last he slowly answered still intently eyeing him
no sooner sir
soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger
ha
jonah thats another stab
but he swiftly calls away the captain from that scent
ill sail with yehe passage money how much is pay now
for it is particularly written shipmates as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history that he paid the fare thereof ere the craft did sail
and taken with the context this is full of meaning
now jonahs captain shipmates was one whose discernment detects crime in any but whose exposes it only in the penniless
in this world shipmates sin that pays its way can travel freely and without a passport whereas virtue if a pauper is stopped at all frontiers
so jonahs captain prepares to test the length of jonahs purse ere he judge him openly
he charges him thrice the usual sum and its assented to
then the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold
yet when jonah fairly takes out his purse prudent suspicions still molest the captain
he rings every coin to find a counterfeit
not a forger any way he mutters and jonah is put down for his passage
point out my stateroom sir says jonah now im i need sleep
thou like it says the captain theres thy room
jonah enters and would lock the door but the lock contains no key
hearing him foolishly fumbling there the captain laughs lowly to himself and mutters something about the doors of convicts cells being never allowed to be locked within
all dressed and dusty as he is jonah throws himself into his berth and finds the little stateroom ceiling almost resting on his forehead
the air is close and jonah gasps
then in that contracted hole sunk too beneath the ships waterline jonah feels the heralding of that stifling hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels wards
screwed at its axis against the side a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in jonahs room and the ship heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received the lamp flame and all though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room though in truth infallibly straight itself it but made obvious the false lying levels among which it hung
the lamp alarms and frightens jonah as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance
but that contradiction in the lamp more and more him
the floor the ceiling and the side are all awry
oh
so my conscience hangs in me
he groans straight upwards so it burns but the chambers of my soul are all in
like one who after a night of drunken revelry to his bed still reeling but with conscience yet pricking him as the of the roman racehorse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels a deep stupor steals over him as over the man who bleeds to death for conscience is the wound and theres naught to staunch it so after sore wrestlings in his berth jonahs prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep
and now the time of tide has come the ship casts off her cables and from the deserted wharf the ship for tarshish all careening glides to sea
that ship my friends was the first of recorded smugglers
the contraband was jonah
but the sea rebels he will not bear the wicked burden
a dreadful storm comes on the ship is like to break
but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her when boxes bales and jars are clattering overboard when the wind is shrieking and the men are yelling and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over jonahs head in all this raging tumult jonah sleeps his hideous sleep
he sees no black sky and raging sea feels not the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him
aye shipmates jonah was gone down into the sides of the berth in the cabin as i have taken it and was fast asleep
but the frightened master comes to him and shrieks in his dead ear what meanest thou o sleeper
arise
startled from his lethargy by that cry jonah staggers to his feet and stumbling to the deck grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea
but at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther leaping over the bulwarks
wave after wave thus leaps into the ship and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat
and ever as the white moon shows her face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead aghast jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep
terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul
in all his attitudes the is now too plainly known
the sailors mark him more and more certain grow their suspicions of him and at last fully to test the truth by referring the whole matter to high heaven they fall to casting lots to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them
the lot is jonahs that discovered then how furiously they mob him with their questions
what is thine occupation
whence thou
thy country
what people
but mark now my shipmates the behavior of poor jonah
the eager mariners but ask him who he is and where from whereas they not only receive an answer to those questions but likewise another answer to a question not put by them but the unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hard hand of god that is upon him
i am a hebrew he theni fear the lord the god of heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land
fear him o jonah
aye well thou fear the lord god then
straightway he now goes on to make a full confession whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled but still are pitiful
for when jonah not yet god for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of his wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea for he knew that for his sake this great tempest was upon them they mercifully turn from him and seek by other means to save the ship
but all in vain the indignant gale howls louder then with one hand raised to god with the other they not lay hold of jonah
and now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east and the sea is still as jonah carries down the gale with him leaving smooth water behind
he goes down in the whirling heart of such a commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him and the whale all his ivory teeth like so many white bolts upon his prison
then jonah prayed unto the lord out of the fishs belly
but observe his prayer and learn a weighty lesson
for sinful as he is jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance
he feels that his dreadful punishment is just
he leaves all his deliverance to god himself with this that spite of all his pains and pangs he will still look towards his holy temple
and here shipmates is true and faithful repentance not clamorous for but grateful for punishment
and how pleasing to god was this conduct in jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale
shipmates i do not place jonah before you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as a model for repentance
sin not but if you do take heed to repent of it like jonah
while he was speaking these words the howling of the shrieking slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher who when describing jonahs seemed tossed by a storm himself
his deep chest heaved as with a groundswell his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them
there now came a lull in his look as he silently turned over the leaves of the book once more and at last standing motionless with closed eyes for the moment seemed communing with god and himself
but again he leaned over towards the people and bowing his head lowly with an aspect of the deepest yet humility he spake these words shipmates god has laid but one hand upon you both his hands press upon me
i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that jonah teaches to all sinners and therefore to ye and still more to me for i am a greater sinner than ye
and now how gladly would i come down from this masthead and sit on the hatches there where you sit and listen as you listen while some one of you reads me that other and more awful lesson which jonah teaches to me as a pilot of the living god
how being an anointed or speaker of true things and by the lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked nineveh jonah appalled at the hostility he should raise fled from his mission and sought to escape his duty and his god by taking ship at joppa
but god is everywhere tarshish he never reached
as we have seen god came upon him in the whale and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom and with swift tore him along into the midst of the seas where the depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down and the weeds were wrapped about his head and all the watery world of woe bowled over him
yet even then beyond the reach of any of the belly of the whale grounded upon the oceans utmost bones even then god heard the repenting prophet when he cried
then god spake unto the fish and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea the whale came up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all the delights of air and earth and vomited out jonah upon the dry land when the word of the lord came a second time and jonah bruised and ears like two seashells still murmuring of the did the bidding
and what was that shipmates
to preach the truth to the face of falsehood
that was it
this shipmates this is that other lesson and woe to that pilot of the living god who slights it
woe to him whom this world charms from gospel duty
woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when god has brewed them into a gale
woe to him who seeks to please rather than to
woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness
woe to him who in this world courts not dishonour
woe to him who would not be true even though to be false were salvation
yea woe to him who as the great pilot paul has it while preaching to others is himself a castaway
he dropped and fell away from himself for a moment then lifting his face to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried out with a heavenly oh
shipmates
on the starboard hand of every woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight than the bottom of the woe is deep
is not the higher than the kelson is low
delight is to hima far far upward and inward against the proud gods and commodores of this earth ever stands forth his own inexorable self
delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him
delight is to him who gives no quarter in the truth and kills burns and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of senators and judges
delight is to him who acknowledges no law or lord but the lord his god and is only a patriot to heaven
delight is to him whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure keel of the ages
and eternal delight and will be his who coming to lay him down can say with his final known to me by thy or immortal here i die
i have striven to be thine more than to be this worlds or mine own
yet this is nothing i leave eternity to thee for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his god
he said no more but slowly waving a benediction covered his face with his hands and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed and he was left alone in the place
chapter 10
a bosom friend
returning to the from the chapel i found there quite alone he having left the chapel before the benediction some time
he was sitting on a bench before the fire with his feet on the stove hearth and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his peering hard into its face and with a jackknife gently whittling away at its nose meanwhile humming to himself in his way
but being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon going to the table took up a large book there and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth i a moment looking around him and giving utterance to a gurgling whistle of astonishment
he would then begin again at the next fifty seeming to commence at number one each time as though he could not count more than fifty and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited
with much interest i sat watching him
savage though he was and hideously marred about the least to my countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable
you cannot hide the soul
through all his unearthly i thought i saw the traces of a simple honest heart and in his large deep eyes fiery black and bold there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils
and besides all this there was a certain lofty bearing about the pagan which even his could not altogether maim
he looked like a man who had never and never had had a creditor
whether it was too that his head being shaved his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief and looked more expansive than it otherwise would this i will not venture to decide but certain it was his head was an excellent one
it may seem ridiculous but it reminded me of general washingtons head as seen in the popular busts of him
it had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows which were likewise very projecting like two long promontories thickly wooded on top
was george washington developed
whilst i was thus closely scanning him meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement he never heeded my presence never troubled himself with so much as a single glance but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book
considering how we had been sleeping together the night previous and especially considering the affectionate arm i had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning i thought this indifference of his very strange
but savages are strange beings at times you do not know exactly how to take them
at first they are their calm of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom
i had noticed also that never consorted at all or but very little with the other seamen in the inn
he made no advances whatever appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances
all this struck me as mighty singular yet upon second thoughts there was something almost sublime in it
here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home by the way of cape horn that was the only way he could get among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet jupiter and yet he seemed entirely at his ease preserving the utmost serenity content with his own companionship always equal to himself
surely this was a touch of fine philosophy though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that
but perhaps to be true philosophers we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving
so soon as i hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher i conclude that like the old woman he must have broken his digester
as i sat there in that now lonely room the fire burning low in that mild stage when after its first intensity has warmed the air it then only glows to be looked at the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements and peering in upon us silent solitary twain the storm booming without in solemn swells i began to be sensible of strange feelings
i felt a melting in me
no more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the world
this soothing savage had redeemed it
there he sat his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland
wild he was a very sight of sights to see yet i began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him
and those same things that would have repelled most others they were the very magnets that thus drew me
ill try a pagan friend thought i since christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy
i drew my bench near him and made some friendly signs and hints doing my best to talk with him meanwhile
at first he little noticed these advances but presently upon my referring to his last nights he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows
i told him yes i thought he looked pleased perhaps a little complimented
we then turned over the book together and i endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it
thus i soon engaged his interest and from that we went to the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town
soon i proposed a social smoke and producing his pouch and tomahawk he quietly offered me a puff
and then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his and keeping it regularly passing between us
if there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the pagans breast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out and left us cronies
he seemed to take to me quite as naturally and as i to him and when our smoke was over he pressed his forehead against mine clasped me round the waist and said that henceforth we were married meaning in his countrys phrase that we were bosom friends he would gladly die for me if need should be
in a countryman this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature a thing to be much distrusted but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply
after supper and another social chat and smoke we went to our room together
he made me a present of his embalmed head took out his enormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out some thirty dollars in silver then spreading them on the table and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions pushed one of them towards me and said it was mine
i was going to but he silenced me by pouring them into my pockets
i let them stay
he then went about his evening prayers took out his idol and removed the paper
by certain signs and symptoms i thought he seemed anxious for me to join him but well knowing what was to follow i deliberated a moment whether in case he invited me i would comply or otherwise
i was a good christian born and bred in the bosom of the infallible presbyterian church
how then could i unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood
but what is worship
thought i
do you suppose now ishmael that the magnanimous god of heaven and and all possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood
impossible
but what is do the will of is worship
and what is the will of do to my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to is the will of god
now is my fellow man
and what do i wish that this would do to me
why unite with me in my particular presbyterian form of worship
consequently i must then unite with him in his ergo i must turn idolator
so i kindled the shavings helped prop up the innocent little idol offered him burnt biscuit with before him twice or thrice kissed his nose and that we undressed and went to bed at peace with our own consciences and all the world
but we did not go to sleep without some little chat
how it is i know not but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends
man and wife they say there open the very bottom of their souls to each other and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning
thus then in our hearts honeymoon lay i and cosy loving pair
chapter 11
nightgown
we had lain thus in bed chatting and napping at short intervals and now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine and then drawing them back so entirely sociable and free and easy were we when at last by reason of our what little remained in us altogether departed and we felt like getting up again though daybreak was yet some way down the future
yes we became very wakeful so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up the clothes well tucked around us leaning against the headboard with our four knees drawn up close together and our two noses bending over them as if our were
we felt very nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out of doors indeed out of too seeing that there was no fire in the room
the more so i say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some small part of you must be cold for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast
nothing exists in itself
if you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable and have been so a long time then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more
but if like and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled why then indeed in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm
for this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich
for the height of this sort of is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your and the cold of the outer air
then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal
we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time when all at once i thought i would open my eyes for when between sheets whether by day or by night and whether asleep or awake i have a way of always keeping my eyes shut in order the more to concentrate the of being in bed
because no man can ever feel his own identity except his eyes be closed as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences though light be more congenial to our clayey part
upon opening my eyes then and coming out of my own pleasant and darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the i experienced a disagreeable revulsion
nor did i at all object to the hint from that perhaps it were best to strike a light seeing that we were so wide awake and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his tomahawk
be it said that though i had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them
for now i liked nothing better than to have smoking by me even in bed because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then
i no more felt unduly concerned for the landlords policy of insurance
i was only alive to the condensed confidential of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend
with our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders we now passed the tomahawk from one to the other till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke illuminated by the flame of the lamp
whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes i know not but he now spoke of his native island and eager to hear his history i begged him to go on and tell it
he gladly complied
though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few of his words yet subsequent disclosures when i had become more familiar with his broken phraseology now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton i give
chapter 12
biographical
was a native of an island far away to the west and south
it is not down in any map true places never are
when a savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout followed by the nibbling goats as if he were a green sapling even then in ambitious soul lurked a strong desire to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two
his father was a high chief a king his uncle a high priest and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors
there was excellent blood in his stuff though sadly vitiated i fear by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his youth
a sag harbor ship visited his fathers bay and sought a passage to christian lands
but the ship having her full complement of seamen spurned his suit and not all the king his fathers influence could prevail
but vowed a vow
alone in his canoe he paddled off to a distant strait which he knew the ship must pass through when she the island
on one side was a coral reef on the other a low tongue of land covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water
hiding his canoe still afloat among these thickets with its prow seaward he sat down in the stern paddle low in hand and when the ship was gliding by like a flash he darted out gained her side with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe climbed up the chains and throwing himself at full length upon the deck grappled a there and swore not to let it go though hacked in pieces
in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists was the son of a king and not
struck by his desperate and his wild desire to visit christendom the captain at last relented and told him he might make himself at home
but this fine young sea prince of wales never saw the captains cabin
they put him down among the sailors and made a of him
but like czar peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities disdained no seeming ignominy if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his countrymen
for at he told was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the christians the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were and more than that still better than they were
but alas
the practices of soon convinced him that even christians could be both miserable and wicked infinitely more so than all his fathers heathens
arrived at last in old sag harbor and seeing what the sailors did there and then going on to nantucket and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also poor gave it up for lost
thought he its a wicked world in all meridians ill die a pagan
and thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among these christians wore their clothes and tried to talk their gibberish
hence the queer ways about him though now some time from home
by hints i asked him whether he did not propose going back and having a coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone he being very old and feeble at the last accounts
he answered no not yet and added that he was fearful christianity or rather christians had unfitted him for ascending the pure and throne of thirty pagan kings before him
but by and by he said he would soon as he felt himself baptized again
for the nonce however he proposed to sail about and sow his wild oats in all four oceans
they had made a of him and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now
i asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching his future movements
he answered to go to sea again in his old vocation
upon this i told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of my intention to sail out of nantucket as being the most promising port for an adventurous to embark from
he at once resolved to accompany me to that island ship aboard the same vessel get into the same watch the same boat the same mess with me in short to share my every hap with both my hands in his boldly dip into the potluck of both worlds
to all this i joyously assented for besides the affection i now felt for he was an experienced and as such could not fail to be of great usefulness to one who like me was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling though well acquainted with the sea as known to merchant seamen
his story being ended with his pipes last dying puff embraced me pressed his forehead against mine and blowing out the light we rolled over from each other this way and that and very soon were sleeping
chapter 13
wheelbarrow
next morning monday after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber for a block i settled my own and comrades bill using however my comrades money
the grinning landlord as well as the boarders seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and as peter coffins cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom i now with
we borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our things including my own poor and canvas sack and hammock away we went down to the moss the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf
as we were going along the people stared not at so they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms
but we heeded them not going along wheeling the barrow by turns and now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs
i asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons
to this in substance he replied that though what i hinted was true enough yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it was of assured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales
in short like many inland reapers and mowers who go into the farmers meadows armed with their own in no wise obliged to furnish so for his own private reasons preferred his own harpoon
shifting the barrow from my hand to his he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen
it was in sag harbor
the owners of his ship it seems had lent him one in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house
not to seem ignorant about the in truth he was entirely so concerning the precise way in which to manage the puts his chest upon it lashes it fast and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf
why said i you might have known better than that one would think
didnt the people laugh
upon this he told me another story
the people of his island of it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held
now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at and its all accounts a very stately punctilious gentleman at least for a sea commander was invited to the wedding feast of sister a pretty young princess just turned of ten
well when all the wedding guests were assembled at the brides bamboo cottage this captain marches in and being assigned the post of honour placed himself over against the punchbowl and between the high priest and his majesty the king father
grace being those people have their grace as well as told me that unlike us who at such times look downwards to our platters they on the contrary copying the ducks glance upwards to the great giver of all i say being said the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island that is dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates
seeing himself placed next the priest and noting the ceremony and thinking captain of a having plain precedence over a mere island king especially in the kings own captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the it i suppose for a huge
now said what you tink our people laugh
at last passage paid and luggage safe we stood on board the schooner
hoisting sail it glided down the acushnet river
on one side new bedford rose in terraces of streets their trees all glittering in the clear cold air
huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves and side by side the whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch all that new cruises were on the start that one most perilous and long voyage ended only begins a second and a second ended only begins a third and so on for ever and for aye
such is the yea the of all earthly effort
gaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh the little moss tossed the quick foam from her bows as a young colt his
how i snuffed that tartar i spurned that turnpike common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records
at the same seemed to drink and reel with me
his dusky nostrils swelled apart he showed his filed and pointed teeth
on on we flew and our offing gained the moss did homage to the blast ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan
sideways leaning we sideways darted every tingling like a wire the two tall masts buckling like indian canes in land tornadoes
so full of this reeling scene were we as we stood by the plunging bowsprit that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers a assembly who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro
but there were some boobies and there who by their intense must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure
caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back
i thought the hour of doom was come
dropping his harpoon the brawny savage caught him in his arms and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength sent him high up bodily into the air then slightly tapping his stern in the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet while turning his back upon him lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff


yelled the bumpkin running towards that officer heres the devil
hallo you sir cried the captain a gaunt rib of the sea stalking up to what in thunder do you mean by that
you know you might have killed that chap
what him say
said as he mildly turned to me
he say said i that you came near that man there pointing to the still shivering greenhorn
cried twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain ah
him bevy no so big whale
look you roared the captain ill you you cannibal if you try any more of your tricks aboard here so mind your eye
but it so happened just then that it was high time for the captain to mind his own eye
the prodigious strain upon the mainsail had parted the and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck
the poor fellow whom had handled so roughly was swept overboard all hands were in a panic and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it seemed madness
it flew from right to left and back again almost in one ticking of a watch and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters
nothing was and nothing seemed capable of being those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale
in the midst of this consternation dropped deftly to his knees and crawling under the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope secured one end to the bulwarks and then flinging the other like a lasso caught it round the boom as it swept over his head and at the next jerk the spar was that way trapped and all was safe
the schooner was run into the wind and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap
for three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog throwing his long arms straight out before him and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam
i looked at the grand and glorious fellow but saw no one to be saved
the greenhorn had gone down
shooting himself perpendicularly from the water now took an instants glance around him and seeming to see just how matters were dived down and disappeared
a few minutes more and he rose again one arm still striking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form
the boat soon picked them up
the poor bumpkin was restored
all hands voted a noble trump the captain begged his
from that hour i clove to like a barnacle yea till poor took his last long dive
was there ever such unconsciousness
he did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies
he only asked for to wipe the brine off that he put on dry clothes lighted his pipe and leaning against the bulwarks and mildly eyeing those around him seemed to be saying to a mutual world in all meridians
we cannibals must help these christians
chapter 14
nantucket
nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning so after a fine run we safely arrived in nantucket
nantucket
take out your map and look at it
see what a real corner of the world it occupies how it stands there away off shore more lonely than the eddystone lighthouse
look at ita mere hillock and elbow of sand all beach without a background
there is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper
some wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there they grow naturally that they import canada thistles that they have to send beyond seas for a to stop a leak in an oil cask that pieces of wood in nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in rome that people there plant before their houses to get under the shade in summer time that one blade of grass makes an oasis three blades in a days walk a prairie that they wear quicksand shoes something like snowshoes that they are so shut up belted about every way inclosed surrounded and made an utter island of by the ocean that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering as to the backs of sea turtles
but these extravaganzas only show that nantucket is no illinois
look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the redmen
thus goes the legend
in olden times an eagle swooped down upon the new england coast and carried off an infant indian in his talons
with loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters
they resolved to follow in the same direction
setting out in their canoes after a perilous passage they discovered the island and there they found an empty ivory poor little indians skeleton
what wonder then that these born on a beach should take to the sea for a livelihood
they first caught crabs and in the sand grown bolder they waded out with nets for mackerel more experienced they pushed off in boats and captured cod and at last launching a navy of great ships on the sea explored this watery world put an incessant belt of round it in at straits and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood most monstrous and most mountainous
that clothed with such of unconscious power that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults
and thus have these naked these sea hermits issuing from their anthill in the sea overrun and conquered the watery world like so many alexanders out among them the atlantic pacific and indian oceans as the three pirate powers did poland
let america add mexico to texas and pile cuba upon canada let the english all india and hang out their blazing banner from the sun two thirds of this globe are the
for the sea is his he owns it as emperors own empires other seamen having but a right of way through it
merchant ships are but extension bridges armed ones but floating forts even pirates and privateers though following the sea as highwaymen the road they but plunder other ships other fragments of the land like themselves without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself
the he alone resides and riots on the sea he alone in bible language goes down to it in ships to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation
there is his home there lies his business which a noahs flood would not interrupt though it overwhelmed all the millions in china
he lives on the sea as prairie cocks in the prairie he hides among the waves he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the alps
for years he knows not the land so that when he comes to it at last it smells like another world more strangely than the moon would to an
with the landless gull that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows so at nightfall the out of sight of land his sails and lays him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales
chapter 15
chowder
it was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly to anchor and and i went ashore so we could attend to no business that day at least none but a supper and a bed
the landlord of the had recommended us to his cousin hosea hussey of the try pots whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all nantucket and moreover he had assured us that cousin hosea as he called him was famous for his
in short he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try potluck at the try pots
but the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the and then keeping that on the hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard and that then ask the first man we met where the place was these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first especially as at the outset insisted that the yellow first point of be left on the hand whereas i had understood peter coffin to say it was on the starboard
however by dint of beating about a little in the dark and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way we at last came to something which there was no mistaking
two enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by asses ears swung from the of an old topmast planted in front of an old doorway
the horns of the were sawed off on the other side so that this old topmast looked not a little like a gallows
perhaps i was over sensitive to such impressions at the time but i could not help staring at this gallows with a vague
a sort of crick was in my neck as i gazed up to the two remaining horns yes two of them one for and one for me
its ominous thinks i
a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port tombstones staring at me in the chapel and here a gallows
and a pair of prodigious black pots too
are these last throwing out oblique hints touching
i was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the inn under a dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injured eye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt
get along with ye said she to the man or ill be combing ye
come on said i all right
theres mrs
hussey
and so it turned out mr hosea hussey being from home but leaving mrs_hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs
upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed mrs_hussey postponing further scolding for the present ushered us into a little room and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast turned round to us and or cod
whats that about cods maam
said i with much politeness
clam or cod
she repeated
a clam for supper
a cold clam is that what you mean mrs
hussey
says i but thats a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time aint it mrs
hussey
but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple shirt who was waiting for it in the entry and seeming to hear nothing but the word clam mrs_hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen and out clam for two disappeared
said i do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam
however a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently prospect before us
but when that smoking chowder came in the mystery was delightfully explained
oh sweet friends
hearken to me
it was made of small juicy clams scarcely bigger than hazel nuts mixed with pounded ship biscuit and salted pork cut up into little flakes the whole enriched with butter and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt
our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage and in particular seeing his favourite fishing food before him and the chowder being excellent we despatched it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and me of clam and cod announcement i thought i would try a little experiment
stepping to the kitchen door i uttered the word cod with great emphasis and resumed my seat
in a few moments the savoury steam came forth again but with a different flavor and in good time a fine was placed before us
we resumed business and while plying our spoons in the bowl thinks i to myself i wonder now if this here has any effect on the head
whats that saying about people
but look aint that a live eel in your bowl
wheres your harpoon
of all fishy places was the try pots which well deserved its name for the pots there were always boiling
chowder for breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper till you began to look for coming through your clothes
the area before the house was paved with
mrs_hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra and hosea hussey had his account books bound in superior old
there was a fishy flavor to the milk too which i could not at all account for till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermens boats i saw cow feeding on fish remnants and marching along the sand with each foot in a cods decapitated head looking very slipshod i assure ye
supper concluded we received a lamp and directions from mrs_hussey concerning the nearest way to bed but as was about to precede me up the stairs the lady reached forth her arm and demanded his harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chambers
why not
said i every true sleeps with his why not
because its dangerous says she
ever since young coming from that of his when he was gone four years and a half with only three barrels of ile was found dead in my first floor back with his harpoon in his side ever since then i allow no boarders to take sich dangerous in their rooms at night
so mr for she had learned his name i will just take this here iron and keep it for you till morning
but the chowder clam or cod tomorrow for breakfast men
both says i and lets have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety
chapter 16
the ship
in bed we concocted our plans for the morrow
but to my surprise and no small concern now gave me to understand that he had been diligently consulting name of his black little yojo had told him two or three times over and strongly insisted upon it that instead of our going together among the in harbor and in concert selecting our craft instead of this i say yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us and in order to do so had already pitched upon a vessel which if left to myself i ishmael should infallibly light upon for all the world as though it had turned out by chance and in that vessel i must immediately ship myself for the present irrespective of
i have forgotten to mention that in many things placed great confidence in the excellence of judgment and surprising forecast of things and cherished yojo with considerable esteem as a rather good sort of god who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs
now this plan of or rather touching the selection of our craft i did not like that plan at all
i had not a little relied upon sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely
but as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon i was obliged to acquiesce and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that trifling little affair
next morning early leaving shut up with yojo in our little it seemed that it was some sort of lent or ramadan or day of fasting humiliation and prayer with and yojo that day how it was i never could find out for though i applied myself to it several times i never could master his liturgies and xxxix then fasting on his tomahawk pipe and yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings i sallied out among the shipping
after much prolonged and many random inquiries i learnt that there were three ships up for the and the pequod
i do not know the origin of is obvious pequod you will no doubt remember was the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians now extinct as the ancient medes
i peered and about the from her hopped over to the and finally going on board the pequod looked around her for a moment and then decided that this was the very ship for us
you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught i luggers mountainous japanese junks and what not but take my word for it you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old pequod
she was a ship of the old school rather small if anything with an look about her
long seasoned and in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans her old hulls complexion was darkened like a french grenadiers who has alike fought in egypt and siberia
her venerable bows looked bearded
her somewhere on the coast of japan where her original ones were lost overboard in a masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of cologne
her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled like the flagstone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled
but to all these her old antiquities were added new and marvellous features pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed
old captain peleg many years her before he commanded another vessel of his own and now a retired seaman and one of the principal owners of the old peleg during the term of his had built upon her original and inlaid it all over with a both of material and device unmatched by anything except it be carved buckler or bedstead
she was like any barbaric ethiopian emperor his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory
she was a thing of trophies
a cannibal of a craft tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies
all round her open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale inserted there for pins to fasten her old and to
those ran not through base blocks of land wood but deftly travelled over sheaves of
a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm she sported there a tiller and that tiller was in one mass curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe
the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the tartar when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw
a noble craft but somehow a most melancholy
all noble things are touched with that
now when i looked about the quarterdeck for some one having authority in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage at first i saw nobody but i could not well overlook a strange sort of tent or rather wigwam pitched a little behind the mainmast
it seemed only a temporary erection used in port
it was of a conical shape some ten feet high consisting of the long huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the
planted with their broad ends on the deck a circle of these slabs laced together mutually sloped towards each other and at the apex united in a tufted point where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the topknot on some old sachems head
a triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship so that the insider commanded a complete view forward
and half concealed in this queer tenement i at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon and the ships work suspended was now enjoying respite from the burden of command
he was seated on an oaken chair wriggling all over with curious carving and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed
there was nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance of the elderly man i saw he was brown and brawny like most old seamen and heavily rolled up in blue cut in the quaker style only there was a fine and almost microscopic network of the wrinkles interlacing round his eyes which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales and always looking to this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together
such are very effectual in a
is this the captain of the pequod
said i advancing to the door of the tent
supposing it be the captain of the pequod what dost thou want of him
he demanded
i was thinking of shipping
thou wast wast thou
i see thou art no been in a stove boat
no sir i never have
dost know nothing at all about whaling i dare
nothing sir but i have no doubt i shall soon learn
ive been several voyages in the merchant service and i think that merchant service be damned
talk not that lingo to me
dost see that take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou of the marchant service to me again
marchant service indeed
i suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships
but flukes
man what makes thee want to go a whaling looks a little suspicious it not been a pirate hast not rob thy last captain didst not think of murdering the officers when thou to sea
i protested my innocence of these things
i saw that under the mask of these half humorous this old seaman as an insulated was full of his insular prejudices and rather distrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from cape cod or the vineyard
but what takes thee
i want to know that before i think of shipping ye
well sir i want to see what whaling is
i want to see the world
want to see what whaling is eh
have ye clapped eye on captain ahab
who is captain ahab sir
aye aye i thought so
captain ahab is the captain of this ship
i am mistaken then
i thought i was speaking to the captain himself
thou art speaking to captain who ye are speaking to young man
it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fitted out for the voyage and supplied with all her needs including crew
we are part owners and agents
but as i was going to say if thou to know what whaling is as thou ye do i can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it past backing out
clap eye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that he has only one leg
what do you mean sir
was the other one lost by a whale
lost by a whale
young man come nearer to me it was devoured chewed up by the that ever chipped a ah
i was a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said as calmly as i could what you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could i know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed i might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident
look ye now young man thy lungs are a sort of soft dye see thou dost not talk shark a bit
sure been to sea before now sure of that
sir said i i thought i told you that i had been four voyages in the merchant hard down out of that
mind what i said about the marchant aggravate mei wont have it
but let us understand each other
i have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feel inclined for it
i do sir
very good
now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whales throat and then jump after it
answer quick
i am sir if it should be positively indispensable to do so not to be got rid of that is which i take to be the fact
good again
now then thou not only to go to find out by experience what whaling is but ye also want to go in order to see the world
was not that what ye said
i thought so
well then just step forward there and take a peep over the and then back to me and tell me what ye see there
for a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request not knowing exactly how to take it whether humorously or in earnest
but concentrating all his crows feet into one captain peleg started me on the errand
going forward and glancing over the weather bow i perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean
the prospect was unlimited but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slightest variety that i could see
well whats the report
said peleg when i came back what did ye see
not much i but water considerable horizon though and theres a squall coming up i think
well what does thou think then of seeing the world
do ye wish to go round cape horn to see any more of it eh
cant ye see the world where you stand
i was a little staggered but go i must and i would and the pequod was as good a ship as anyi thought the all this i now repeated to peleg
seeing me so determined he expressed his willingness to ship me
and thou as well sign the papers right off he along with ye
and so saying he led the way below deck into the cabin
seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure
it turned out to be captain bildad who along with captain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel the other shares as is sometimes the case in these ports being held by a crowd of old widows fatherless children and chancery wards each owning about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail or two in the ship
people in nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest
now bildad like peleg and indeed many other was a quaker the island having been originally settled by that sect and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the quaker only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous
for some of these same quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and
they are fighting quakers they are quakers with a vengeance
so that there are instances among them of men who named with scripture singularly common fashion on the in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives strangely blend with these peculiarities a thousand bold dashes of character not unworthy a scandinavian or a poetical pagan roman
and when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force with a globular brain and a ponderous heart who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long in the remotest waters and beneath constellations never seen here at the north been led to think and independently receiving all natures sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast and thereby chiefly but with some help from accidental advantages to learn a bold and nervous lofty man makes one in a whole nations mighty pageant creature formed for noble tragedies
nor will it at all detract from him dramatically regarded if either by birth or other circumstances he have what seems a half wilful overruling at the bottom of his nature
for all men tragically great are made so through a certain
be sure of this o young ambition all mortal greatness is but disease
but as yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite another and still a man who if indeed peculiar it only results again from another phase of the quaker modified by individual circumstances
like captain peleg captain bildad was a retired
but unlike captain cared not a rush for what are called serious things and indeed deemed those serious things the of all bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism but all his subsequent ocean life and the sight of many lovely island creatures round the that had not moved this native born quaker one single jot had not so much as altered one angle of his vest
still for all this was there some lack of common consistency about worthy captain peleg
though refusing from conscientious scruples to bear arms against land invaders yet himself had invaded the atlantic and pacific and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed yet had he in his coat spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore
how now in the contemplative evening of his days the pious bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence i do not know but it did not seem to concern him much and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a mans religion is one thing and this practical world quite another
this world pays dividends
rising from a little in short clothes of the drab to a in a broad waistcoat from that becoming and captain and finally a ship owner bildad as i hinted before had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his income
now bildad i am sorry to say had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks and in his seagoing days a bitter hard taskmaster
they told me in nantucket though it certainly seems a curious story that when he sailed the old his crew upon arriving home were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital sore exhausted and worn out
for a pious man especially for a quaker he was certainly rather to say the least
he never used to swear though at his men they said but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel unmitigated hard work out of them
when bildad was a to have his eye intently looking at you made you feel completely nervous till you could clutch hammer or a and go to work like mad at something or other never mind what
indolence and idleness perished before him
his own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character
on his long gaunt body he carried no spare flesh no superfluous beard his chin having a soft economical nap to it like the worn nap of his hat
such then was the person that i saw seated on the transom when i followed captain peleg down into the cabin
the space between the decks was small and there sat old bildad who always sat so and never leaned and this to save his coat tails
his was placed beside him his legs were stiffly crossed his drab was buttoned up to his chin and spectacles on nose he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume
bildad cried captain peleg at it again bildad eh
ye have been studying those scriptures now for the last thirty years to my certain knowledge
how far ye got bildad
as if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate bildad without noticing his present irreverence quietly looked up and seeing me glanced again towards peleg
he says hes our man bildad said peleg he wants to ship
dost thee
said bildad in a hollow tone and turning round to me
i dost said i unconsciously he was so intense a quaker
what do ye think of him bildad
said peleg
hell do said bildad eyeing me and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible
i thought him the old quaker i ever saw especially as peleg his friend and old shipmate seemed such a
but i said nothing only looking round me sharply
peleg now threw open a chest and drawing forth the ships articles placed pen and ink before him and seated himself at a little table
i began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage for the voyage
i was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages but all hands including the captain received certain shares of the profits called lays and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ships company
i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling my own lay would not be very large but considering that i was used to the sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that i made no doubt that from all i had heard i should be offered at least the 275th is the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage whatever that might eventually amount to
and though the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay yet it was better than nothing and if we had a lucky voyage might pretty nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out on it not to speak of my three years beef and board for which i would not have to pay one
it might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely so it was a very poor way indeed
but i am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me while i am putting up at this grim sign of the thunder cloud
upon the whole i thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing but would not have been surprised had i been offered the 200th considering i was of a make
but one thing nevertheless that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this ashore i had heard something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad how that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners left nearly the whole management of the ships affairs to these two
and i did not know but what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands especially as i now found him on board the pequod quite at home there in the cabin and reading his bible as if at his own fireside
now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jackknife old bildad to my no small surprise considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings bildad never heeded us but went on mumbling to himself out of his book lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth well captain bildad interrupted peleg what dye say what lay shall we give this young man
thou best was the sepulchral reply the seven hundred and wouldnt be too much would moth and rust do corrupt but lay lay indeed thought i and such a lay
the seven hundred and
well old bildad you are determined that i for one shall not lay up many lays here below where moth and rust do corrupt
it was an exceedingly long lay that indeed and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and is a pretty large number yet when you come to make a of it you will then see i say that the seven hundred and part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and gold doubloons and so i thought at the time
why blast your eyes bildad cried peleg thou dost not want to swindle this young man
he must have more than that
seven hundred and again said bildad without lifting his eyes and then went on where your treasure is there will your heart be also
i am going to put him down for the three hundredth said peleg do ye hear that bildad
the three hundredth lay i say
bildad laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him said captain peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider the duty thou to the other owners of this and orphans many of that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans
the seven hundred and lay captain peleg
thou bildad
roared peleg starting up and clattering about the cabin
blast ye captain bildad if i had followed thy advice in these matters i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape horn
captain peleg said bildad steadily thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water or ten fathoms i cant tell but as thou art still an man captain peleg i greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit captain peleg
fiery pit
fiery pit
ye insult me man past all natural bearing ye insult me
its an outrage to tell any human creature that hes bound to hell
flukes and flames
bildad say that again to me and start my but ill swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on
out of the cabin ye canting son of a wooden guna straight wake with ye
as he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad but with a marvellous oblique sliding celerity bildad for that time eluded him
alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded i stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad who i made no doubt was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of peleg
but to my astonishment he sat down again on the transom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing
he seemed quite used to peleg and his ways
as for peleg after letting off his rage as he had there seemed no more left in him and he too sat down like a lamb though he a little as if still nervously agitated

he whistled at squalls gone off to leeward i think
bildad thou used to be good at sharpening a lance mend that pen will ye
my jackknife here needs the grindstone
thats he thank ye bildad
now then my young man ishmaels thy name didnt ye say
well then down ye go here ishmael for the three hundredth lay
captain peleg said i i have a friend with me who wants to ship i bring him down tomorrow
to be sure said peleg
fetch him along and well look at him
what lay does he want
groaned bildad glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself
oh
never thee mind about that bildad said peleg
has he ever it any
turning to me
killed more whales than i can count captain peleg
well bring him along then
and after signing the papers off i went nothing doubting but that i had a good mornings work and that the pequod was the identical ship that yojo had provided to carry and me round the cape
but i had not proceeded far when i began to me that the captain with whom i was to sail yet remained unseen by me though indeed in many cases a will be completely fitted out and receive all her crew on board ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief that if the captain have a family or any absorbing of that sort he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea
however it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands
turning back i accosted captain peleg inquiring where captain ahab was to be found
and what dost thou want of captain ahab
its all right enough thou art shipped
yes but i should like to see him
but i think thou wilt be able to at present
i know exactly whats the matter with him but he keeps close inside the house a sort of sick and yet he look so
in fact he aint sick but no he isnt well either
any how young man he wont always see me so i suppose he will thee
hes a queer man captain some a good one
oh like him well enough no fear no fear
hes a grand ungodly godlike man captain ahab doesnt speak much but when he does speak then you may well listen
mark ye be forewarned ahabs above the common ahabs been in colleges as well as mong the cannibals been used to deeper wonders than the waves fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes than whales
his lance
aye the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle
oh
he aint captain bildad no and he aint captain peleg hes ahab boy and ahab of old thou was a crowned king
and a very vile one
when that wicked king was slain the dogs did they not lick his blood
come hither to hither said peleg with a significance in his eye that almost startled me
look ye lad never say that on board the pequod
never say it anywhere
captain ahab did not name himself
twas a foolish ignorant whim of his crazy widowed mother who died when he was only a old
and yet the old squaw at said that the name would somehow prove prophetic
and perhaps other fools like her may tell thee the same
i wish to warn thee
its a lie
i know captain ahab well ive sailed with him as mate years ago i know what he isa good a pious good man like bildad but a swearing good like theres a good deal more of him
aye aye i know that he was never very jolly and i know that on the passage home he was a little out of his mind for a spell but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about as any one might see
i know too that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale hes been a kind of moody and savage sometimes but that will all pass off
and once for all let me tell thee and assure thee young man its better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one
so goodbye to wrong not captain ahab because he happens to have a wicked name
besides my boy he has a three voyages sweet resigned girl
think of that by that sweet girl that old man has a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless harm in ahab
no no my lad stricken blasted if he be ahab has his humanities
as i walked away i was full of thoughtfulness what had been incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab filled me with a certain wild vagueness of concerning him
and somehow at the time i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for i know what unless it was the cruel loss of his leg
and yet i also felt a strange awe of him but that sort of awe which i cannot at all describe was not exactly awe i do not know what it was
but i felt it and it did not me towards him though i felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him so imperfectly as he was known to me then
however my thoughts were at length carried in other directions so that for the present dark ahab slipped my mind
chapter 17
the ramadan
as ramadan or fasting and humiliation was to continue all day i did not choose to disturb him till towards nightfall for i cherish the greatest respect towards everybodys religious obligations never mind how comical and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toadstool or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth who with a degree of quite unprecedented in other planets bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name
i say we good presbyterian christians should be charitable in these things and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals pagans and what not because of their conceits on these subjects
there was now certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about yojo and his what of that
thought he knew what he was about i suppose he seemed to be content and there let him rest
all our arguing with him would not avail let him be i say and heaven have mercy on us and pagans we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head and sadly need mending
towards evening when i felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over i went up to his room and knocked at the door but no answer
i tried to open it but it was fastened inside
said i softly through the silent
i say
why you speak
its
but all remained still as before
i began to grow alarmed
i had allowed him such abundant time i thought he might have had an apoplectic fit
i looked through the keyhole but the door opening into an odd corner of the room the keyhole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one
i could only see part of the of the bed and a line of the wall but nothing more
i was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of harpoon which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him before our mounting to the chamber
thats strange thought i but at any rate since the harpoon stands yonder and he seldom or never goes abroad without it therefore he must be inside here and no possible mistake

all still
something must have happened
apoplexy
i tried to burst open the door but it stubbornly resisted
running down stairs i quickly stated my suspicions to the first person i chambermaid
la
la
she cried i thought something must be the matter
i went to make the bed after breakfast and the door was locked and not a mouse to be heard and its been just so silent ever since
but i thought may be you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping
la
la
murder
mrs_hussey
apoplexy
and with these cries she ran towards the kitchen i following
mrs_hussey soon appeared with a in one hand and a in the other having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the castors and scolding her little black boy meantime
woodhouse
cried i which way to it
run for gods sake and fetch something to pry open the axe
hes had a stroke depend upon it
and so saying i was rushing up stairs again when mrs_hussey interposed the and and the entire castor of her countenance
whats the matter with you young man
get the axe
for gods sake run for the doctor some one while i pry it open
look here said the landlady quickly putting down the so as to have one hand free look here are you talking about prying open any of my doors
and with that she seized my arm
whats the matter with you
whats the matter with you shipmate
in as calm but rapid a manner as possible i gave her to understand the whole case
unconsciously clapping the to one side of her nose she for an instant then
i havent seen it since i put it there
running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs she glanced in and returning told me that harpoon was missing
hes killed himself she cried
its over goes another pity his poor will be the ruin of my house
has the poor lad a sister
wheres that betty go to the painter and tell him to paint me a sign suicides permitted here and no smoking in the as well kill both birds at once
kill
the lord be merciful to his ghost
whats that noise there
you young man avast there
and running up after me she caught me as i was again trying to force open the door
i allow it i wont have my premises spoiled
go for the locksmith theres one about a mile from here
but avast
putting her hand in her heres a key thatll fit i guess lets see
and with that she turned it in the lock but alas
supplemental bolt remained within
have to burst it open said i and was running down the entry a little for a good start when the landlady caught at me again vowing i should not break down her premises but i tore from her and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark
with a prodigious noise the door flew open and the knob slamming against the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling and there good heavens
there sat altogether cool and right in the middle of the room squatting on his hams and holding yojo on top of his head
he looked neither one way nor the other way but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life
said i going up to him whats the matter with you
he been a sittin so all day has he
said the landlady
but all we said not a word could we drag out of him i almost felt like pushing him over so as to change his position for it was almost intolerable it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained especially as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours going too without his regular meals
mrs_hussey said i hes alive at all events so leave us if you please and i will see to this strange affair myself
closing the door upon the landlady i endeavored to prevail upon to take a chair but in vain
there he sat and all he could all my polite arts and would not move a peg nor say a single word nor even look at me nor notice my presence in the slightest way
i wonder thought i if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan do they fast on their hams that way in his native island
it must be so yes its part of his creed i suppose well then let him rest hell get up sooner or later no doubt
it cant last for ever thank god and his ramadan only comes once a year and i believe its very punctual then
i went down to supper
after sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a voyage as they called it that is a short in a schooner or brig confined to the north of the line in the atlantic ocean only after listening to these till nearly eleven oclock i went up stairs to go to bed feeling quite sure by this time must certainly have brought his ramadan to a termination
but no there he was just where i had left him he had not stirred an inch
i began to grow vexed with him it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room holding a piece of wood on his head
for heavens sake get up and shake yourself get up and have some supper
youll starve youll kill yourself
but not a word did he reply
despairing of him therefore i determined to go to bed and to sleep and no doubt before a great while he would follow me
but previous to turning in i took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it over him as it promised to be a very cold night and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on
for some time do all i would i could not get into the faintest doze
i had blown out the candle and the mere thought of four feet there in that uneasy position stark alone in the cold and dark this made me really wretched
think of it sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary unaccountable ramadan
but somehow i dropped off at last and knew nothing more till break of day when looking over the bedside there squatted as if he had been screwed down to the floor
but as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window up he got with stiff and grating joints but with a cheerful look limped towards me where i lay pressed his forehead again against mine and said his ramadan was over
now as i before hinted i have no objection to any persons religion be it what it may so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person because that other person believe it also
but when a mans religion becomes really frantic when it is a positive torment to him and in fine makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in then i think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him
and just so i now did with
said i get into bed now and lie and listen to me
i then went on beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions and coming down to the various religions of the present time during which time i labored to show that all these lents and prolonged in cold rooms were stark nonsense bad for the health useless for the soul opposed in short to the obvious laws of hygiene and common sense
i told him too that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage it pained me very badly pained me to see him now so foolish about this ridiculous ramadan of his
besides argued i fasting makes the body cave in hence the spirit caves in and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be
this is the reason why most cherish such melancholy notions about their
in one word said i rather hell is an idea first born on an undigested and since then perpetuated through the hereditary nurtured by
i then asked whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia expressing the idea very plainly so that he could take it in
he said no only upon one memorable occasion
it was after a great feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two oclock in the afternoon and all cooked and eaten that very evening
no more said i shuddering that will do for i knew the inferences without his further hinting them
i had seen a sailor who had visited that very island and he told me that it was the custom when a great battle had been gained there to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor and then one by one they were placed in great wooden and garnished round like a with breadfruit and and with some parsley in their mouths were sent round with the victors compliments to all his friends just as though these presents were so many christmas turkeys
after all i do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon
because in the first place he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject unless considered from his own point of view and in the second place he did not more than one third understand me couch my ideas simply as i would and finally he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than i did
he looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety
at last we rose and dressed and taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of of all sorts so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his ramadan we sallied out to board the pequod along and picking our teeth with halibut bones
chapter 18
his mark
as we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship carrying his harpoon captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft unless they previously produced their papers
what do you mean by that captain peleg
said i now jumping on the bulwarks and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf
i mean he replied he must show his papers
yes said captain bildad in his hollow voice sticking his head from behind out of the wigwam
he must show that hes converted
son of darkness he added turning to art thou at present in communion with any christian church
why said i hes a member of the first congregational church
here be it said that many tattooed savages sailing in nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches
first congregational church cried bildad what
that worships in deacon deuteronomy colemans meetinghouse
and so saying taking out his spectacles he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief and putting them on very carefully came out of the wigwam and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks took a good long look at
how long hath he been a member
he then said turning to me not very long i rather guess young man
no said peleg and he hasnt been baptized right either or it would have washed some of that devils blue off his face
do tell now cried bildad is this philistine a regular member of deacon meeting
i never saw him going there and i pass it every lords day
i know anything about deacon deuteronomy or his meeting said i all i know is that here is a born member of the first congregational church
he is a deacon himself is
young man said bildad sternly thou art with thyself thou young hittite
what church dost thee mean
answer me
finding myself thus hard pushed i replied
i mean sir the same ancient catholic church to which you and i and captain peleg there and here and all of us and every mothers son and soul of us belong the great and everlasting first congregation of this whole worshipping world we all belong to that only some of us cherish some queer no ways touching the grand belief in that we all join hands
splice thou splice hands cried peleg drawing nearer
young man youd better ship for a missionary instead of a foremast hand i never heard a better sermon
deacon father himself couldnt beat it and hes reckoned something
come aboard come aboard never mind about the papers
i say tell that you call him
tell to step along
by the great anchor what a harpoon hes got there
looks like good stuff that and he handles it about right
i say or whatever your name is did you ever stand in the head of a whaleboat
did you ever strike a fish
without saying a word in his wild sort of way jumped upon the bulwarks from thence into the bows of one of the whaleboats hanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and his harpoon cried out in some such way as this you see him small drop tar on water dere
you see him
well him one whale eye well den
and taking sharp aim at it he darted the iron right over old broad brim clean across the ships decks and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight
now said quietly hauling in the line him eye why dad whale dead
quick bildad said peleg his partner who aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon had retreated towards the cabin gangway
quick i say you bildad and get the ships papers
we must have hedgehog there i mean in one of our boats
look ye well give ye the ninetieth lay and thats more than ever was given a yet out of nantucket
so down we went into the cabin and to my great joy was soon enrolled among the same ships company to which i myself belonged
when all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready for signing he turned to me and said i guess there know how to write does he
i say blast ye
dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark
but at this question who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies looked no ways but taking the offered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm so that through captain obstinate mistake touching his it stood something like this
his x mark
meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his drab coat took out a bundle of tracts and selecting one entitled the latter day coming or no time to lose placed it in hands and then grasping them and the book with both his looked earnestly into his eyes and said son of darkness i must do my duty by thee i am part owner of this ship and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew if thou still to thy pagan ways which i sadly fear i beseech thee remain not for aye a belial bondsman
spurn the idol bell and the hideous dragon turn from the wrath to come mind thine eye i say oh
goodness gracious
steer clear of the fiery pit
something of the salt sea yet lingered in old language mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases
avast there avast there bildad avast now spoiling our cried peleg
pious never make good takes the shark out of em no is worth a straw who aint pretty
there was young nat swaine once the bravest out of all nantucket and the vineyard he joined the meeting and never came to good
he got so frightened about his soul that he and away from whales for fear of in case he got stove and went to davy jones
peleg
peleg
said bildad lifting his eyes and hands thou thyself as i myself hast seen many a perilous time thou peleg what it is to have the fear of death how then thou in this ungodly guise
thou thine own heart peleg
tell me when this same pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on japan that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab didst thou not think of death and the judgment then
hear him hear him now cried peleg marching across the cabin and thrusting his hands far down into his him all of ye
think of that
when every moment we thought the ship would sink
death and the judgment then
what
with all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side and every sea breaking over us fore and aft
think of death and the judgment then
no
no time to think about death then
life was what captain ahab and i was thinking of and how to save all to rig to get into the nearest port that was what i was thinking of
bildad said no more but up his coat stalked on deck where we followed him
there he stood very quietly overlooking some who were mending a topsail in the waist
now and then he stooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine which otherwise might have been wasted
chapter 19
the prophet
shipmates have ye shipped in that ship
and i had just left the pequod and were away from the water for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts when the above words were put to us by a stranger who pausing before us levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question
he was but in faded jacket and patched a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck
a confluent smallpox had in all directions flowed over his face and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent when the rushing waters have been dried up
have ye shipped in her
he repeated
you mean the ship pequod i suppose said i trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him
aye the ship there he said drawing back his whole arm and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object
yes said i we have just signed the articles
anything down there about your souls
about what
oh perhaps you got any he said quickly
no matter though i know many chaps that got luck to em and they are all the better off for it
a souls a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon
what are you about shipmate
said i
hes got enough though to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps abruptly said the stranger placing a nervous emphasis upon the word he
said i lets go this fellow has broken loose from somewhere hes talking about something and somebody we know
stop
cried the stranger
ye said seen old thunder yet have ye
whos old thunder
said i again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner
captain ahab
what
the captain of our ship the pequod
aye among some of us old sailor chaps he goes by that name
ye seen him yet have ye
no we
hes sick they say but is getting better and will be all right again before long
all right again before long
laughed the stranger with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh
look ye when captain ahab is all right then this left arm of mine will be all right not before
what do you know about him
what did they tell you about him
say that
they didnt tell much of anything about him only ive heard that hes a good and a good captain to his crew
thats true thats both true enough
but you must jump when he gives an order
step and growl growl and the word with captain ahab
but nothing about that thing that happened to him off cape horn long ago when he lay like dead for three days and nights nothing about that deadly with the spaniard afore the altar in nothing about that eh
nothing about the silver calabash he spat into
and nothing about his losing his leg last voyage according to the prophecy
didnt ye hear a word about them matters and something more eh
no i think ye did how could ye
who knows it
not all nantucket i guess
but heard tell about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard of that i dare say
oh yes that every one knows mean they know hes only one leg and that a took the other off
my friend said i what all this gibberish of yours is about i know and i much care for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head
but if you are speaking of captain ahab of that ship there the pequod then let me tell you that i know all about the loss of his leg
all about it you
pretty sure
with finger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod the stranger stood a moment as if in a troubled reverie then starting a little turned and shipped have ye
names down on the papers
well well whats signed is signed and whats to be will be and then again perhaps it wont be after all
anyhow its all fixed and arranged and some sailors or other must go with him i suppose as well these as any other men god pity em
morning to ye shipmates morning the ineffable heavens bless ye im sorry i stopped ye
look here friend said i if you have anything important to tell us out with it but if you are only trying to bamboozle us you are mistaken in your game thats all i have to say
and its said very well and i like to hear a chap talk up that way you are just the man for likes of ye
morning to ye shipmates morning
oh
when ye get there tell em ive concluded not to make one of em
ah my dear fellow you cant fool us that cant fool us
it is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him
morning to ye shipmates morning
morning it is said i
come along lets leave this crazy man
but stop tell me your name will you
elijah
elijah
thought i and we walked away both commenting after each others fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear
but we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards when to turn a corner and looking back as i did so who should be seen but elijah following us though at a distance
somehow the sight of him struck me so that i said nothing to of his being behind but passed on with my comrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did
he did and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine
this circumstance coupled with his ambiguous shrouded sort of talk now begat in me all kinds of vague and and all connected with the pequod and captain ahab and the leg he had lost and the cape horn fit and the silver calabash and what captain peleg had said of him when i left the ship the day previous and the prediction of the squaw and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail and a hundred other shadowy things
i was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah was really dogging us or not and with that intent crossed the way with and on that side of it retraced our steps
but elijah passed on without seeming to notice us
this relieved me and once more and finally as it seemed to me i pronounced him in my heart a humbug
chapter 20
all
a day or two passed and there was great activity aboard the pequod
not only were the old sails being mended but new sails were coming on board and bolts of canvas and coils of rigging in short everything that the ships preparations were hurrying to a close
captain peleg seldom or never went ashore but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp lookout upon the hands bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after nightfall
on the day following signing the articles word was given at all the inns where the ships company were stopping that their chests must be on board before night for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing
so and i got down our traps resolving however to sleep ashore till the last
but it seems they always give very long notice in these cases and the ship did not sail for several days
but no wonder there was a good deal to be and there is no telling how many things to be thought of before the pequod was fully equipped
every one knows what a multitude of knives and forks shovels and tongs napkins nutcrackers and what not are indispensable to the business of housekeeping
just so with whaling which necessitates a housekeeping upon the wide ocean far from all grocers doctors bakers and bankers
and though this also holds true of merchant vessels yet not by any means to the same extent as with
for besides the great length of the whaling voyage the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented it must be remembered that of all ships whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends
hence the spare boats spare spars and spare lines and harpoons and spare everythings almost but a spare captain and duplicate ship
at the period of our arrival at the island the heaviest storage of the pequod had been almost completed comprising her beef bread water fuel and iron hoops and staves
but as before hinted for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things both large and small
chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was captain sister a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit but withal very kindhearted who seemed resolved that if she could help it nothing should be found wanting in the pequod after once fairly getting to sea
at one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the stewards pantry another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mates desk where he kept his log a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some ones rheumatic back
never did any woman better deserve her name which was charity as everybody called her
and like a sister of charity did this charitable aunt charity bustle about hither and thither ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety comfort and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother bildad was concerned and in which she herself owned a score or two of dollars
but it was startling to see this excellent hearted coming on board as she did the last day with a long in one hand and a still longer whaling lance in the other
nor was bildad himself nor captain peleg at all backward
as for bildad he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed and at every fresh arrival down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper
every once in a while peleg came out of his whalebone den roaring at the men down the roaring up to the riggers at the masthead and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam
during these days of preparation and i often visited the craft and as often i asked about captain ahab and how he was and when he was going to come on board his ship
to these questions they would answer that he was getting better and better and was expected aboard every day meantime the two captains peleg and bildad could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage
if i had been downright honest with myself i would have seen very plainly in my heart that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea
but when a man suspects any wrong it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter he strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself
and much this way it was with me
i said nothing and tried to think nothing
at last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail
so next morning and i took a very early start
chapter 21
going aboard
it was nearly six oclock but only grey imperfect misty dawn when we drew nigh the wharf
there are some sailors running ahead there if i see right said i to it cant be shadows shes off by sunrise i guess come on
avast
cried a voice whose owner at the same time coming close behind us laid a hand upon both our shoulders and then insinuating himself between us stood stooping forward a little in the uncertain twilight strangely peering from to me
it was elijah
going aboard
hands off will you said i
here said shaking himself go way
aint going aboard then
yes we are said i but what business is that of yours
do you know mr elijah that i consider you a little impertinent
no no no i wasnt aware of that said elijah slowly and looking from me to with the most unaccountable glances
elijah said i you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing
we are going to the indian and pacific oceans and would prefer not to be detained
ye be be ye
coming back afore breakfast
hes cracked said i come on

cried stationary elijah hailing us when we had removed a few paces
never mind him said i come on
but he stole up to us again and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago
struck by this plain question i answered saying yes i thought i did see four or five men but it was too dim to be sure
very dim very dim said elijah
morning to ye
once more we him but once more he came softly after us and touching my shoulder again said see if you can find em now will ye
find who
morning to ye
morning to ye
he rejoined again moving off
oh
i was going to warn ye never mind never all one all in the family frost this morning aint it
goodbye to ye
shant see ye again very soon i guess unless its before the grand jury
and with these cracked words he finally departed leaving me for the moment in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence
at last stepping on board the pequod we found everything in profound quiet not a soul moving
the cabin entrance was locked within the hatches were all on and with coils of rigging
going forward to the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttle open
seeing a light we went down and found only an old rigger there wrapped in a tattered
he was thrown at whole length upon two chests his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms
the slumber slept upon him
those sailors we saw where can they have gone to
said i looking dubiously at the sleeper
but it seemed that when on the wharf had not at all noticed what i now alluded to hence i would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter were it not for elijahs otherwise inexplicable question
but i beat the thing down and again marking the sleeper jocularly hinted to that perhaps we had best sit up with the body telling him to establish himself accordingly
he put his hand upon the sleepers rear as though feeling if it was soft enough and then without more ado sat quietly down there
gracious
sit there said i
oh
perry dood seat said my country way wont hurt him face
face
said i call that his face
very benevolent countenance then but how hard he breathes hes heaving himself get off you are heavy its grinding the face of the poor
get off
look hell twitch you off soon
i wonder he wake
removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper and lighted his tomahawk pipe
i sat at the feet
we kept the pipe passing over the sleeper from one to the other
meanwhile upon questioning him in his broken fashion gave me to understand that in his land owing to the absence of and sofas of all sorts the king chiefs and great people generally were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows and lay them round in the piers and alcoves
besides it was very convenient on an excursion much better than those which are convertible into upon occasion a chief calling his attendant and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree perhaps in some damp marshy place
while narrating these things every time received the tomahawk from me he flourished the of it over the sleepers head
whats that for
perry easy oh
perry easy
he was going on with some wild reminiscences about his which it seemed had in its two uses both his foes and soothed his soul when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger
the strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole it began to tell upon him
he breathed with a sort of then seemed troubled in the nose then revolved over once or twice then sat up and rubbed his eyes

he breathed at last who be ye smokers
shipped men answered i when does she sail
aye aye ye are going in her be ye
she sails today
the captain came aboard last night
what
who but him indeed
i was going to ask him some further questions concerning ahab when we heard a noise on deck

starbucks said the rigger
hes a lively chief mate that good man and a pious but all alive now i must turn to
and so saying he went on deck and we followed
it was now clear sunrise
soon the crew came on board in twos and threes the riggers themselves the mates were actively engaged and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board
meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin
chapter 22
merry christmas
at length towards noon upon the final dismissal of the ships riggers and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf and after the charity had come off in a whaleboat with her last nightcap for stubb the second mate her and a spare bible for the all this the two captains peleg and bildad issued from the cabin and turning to the chief mate peleg said now starbuck are you sure everything is right
captain ahab is all spoke to more to be got from shore eh
well call all hands then
muster em aft em
no need of profane words however great the hurry peleg said bildad but away with thee friend starbuck and do our bidding
how now
here upon the very point of starting for the voyage captain peleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarterdeck just as if they were to be at sea as well as to all appearances in port
and as for captain ahab no sign of him was yet to be seen only they said he was in the cabin
but then the idea was that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh and steering her well out to sea
indeed as that was not at all his proper business but the pilots and as he was not yet completely they captain ahab stayed below
and all this seemed natural enough especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor but remain over the cabin table having a farewell merrymaking with their shore friends before they quit the ship for good with the pilot
but there was not much chance to think over the matter for captain peleg was now all alive
he seemed to do most of the talking and commanding and not bildad
aft here ye sons of bachelors he cried as the sailors lingered at the mainmast
starbuck aft
strike the tent there
was the next order
as i hinted before this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port and on board the pequod for thirty years the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor
man the capstan
blood and
was the next command and the crew sprang for the
now in getting under weigh the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship
and here bildad who with peleg be it known in addition to his other officers was one of the licensed pilots of the being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the nantucket to all the ships he was concerned in for he never piloted any other i say might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody to cheer the hands at the windlass who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in alley with hearty good will
nevertheless not three days previous bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod particularly in getting under weigh and charity his sister had placed a small choice copy of watts in each seamans berth
meantime overseeing the other part of the ship captain peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner
i almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up involuntarily i paused on my and told to do the same thinking of the perils we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot
i was comforting myself however with the thought that in pious bildad might be found some salvation spite of his seven hundred and lay when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear and turning round was horrified at the apparition of captain peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity
that was my first kick
is that the way they heave in the marchant service
he roared
spring thou spring and break thy backbone
why ye spring i say all of

spring thou chap with the red whiskers spring there spring thou green pants
spring i say all of ye and spring your eyes out
and so saying he moved along the windlass here and there using his leg very freely while bildad kept leading off with his psalmody
thinks i captain peleg must have been drinking something today
at last the anchor was up the sails were set and off we glided
it was a short cold christmas and as the short northern day merged into night we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose freezing spray cased us in ice as in polished armor
the long rows of teeth on the bulwarks in the moonlight and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant vast curving icicles depended from the bows
lank bildad as pilot headed the first watch and ever and anon as the old craft deep dived into the green seas and sent the shivering frost all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang his steady notes were heard sweet fields beyond the swelling flood stand dressed in living green
so to the jews old canaan stood while jordan rolled between
never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then
they were full of hope and fruition
spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous atlantic spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket there was yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store and meads and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by the spring remains at midsummer
at last we gained such an offing that the two pilots were needed no longer
the stout sailboat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside
it was curious and not how peleg and bildad were affected at this juncture especially captain bildad
for loath to depart yet very loath to leave for good a ship bound on so long and perilous a both stormy capes a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested a ship in which an old shipmate sailed as captain a man almost as old as he once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw loath to say goodbye to a thing so every way of every interest to old bildad lingered long paced the deck with anxious strides ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there again came on deck and looked to windward looked towards the wide and endless waters only bounded by the unseen eastern continents looked towards the land looked aloft looked right and left looked everywhere and nowhere and at last mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin grasped stout peleg by the hand and holding up a lantern for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face as much as to say nevertheless friend peleg i can stand it yes i can
as for peleg himself he took it more like a philosopher but for all his philosophy there was a tear twinkling in his eye when the lantern came too near
and he too did not a little run from cabin to a word below and now a word with starbuck the chief mate
but at last he turned to his comrade with a final sort of look about old shipmate we must go
back the there
boat ahoy
stand by to come close alongside now
careful bildad your last
luck to ye to ye to ye mr and good luck to ye alland this day three years ill have a hot supper smoking for ye in old nantucket
hurrah and away
god bless ye and have ye in his holy keeping men murmured old bildad almost incoherently
i hope yell have fine weather now so that captain ahab may soon be moving among yea pleasant sun is all he needs and yell have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go
be careful in the hunt ye mates
stave the boats needlessly ye good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent
within the year
forget your prayers either
starbuck mind that cooper waste the spare staves
oh
the are in the green locker
whale it too much a lords days men but miss a fair chance either thats rejecting heavens good gifts
have an eye to the molasses stubb it was a little leaky i thought
if ye touch at the islands mr flask beware of fornication
goodbye goodbye
keep that cheese too long down in the hold starbuck itll spoil
be careful with the cents the pound it was and mind ye if come come captain bildad stop
and with that peleg hurried him over the side and both into the boat
ship and boat diverged the cold damp night breeze blew between a screaming gull flew overhead the two hulls wildly rolled we gave three cheers and blindly plunged like fate into the lone atlantic
chapter 23
the lee shore
some chapters back one bulkington was spoken of a tall mariner encountered in new bedford at the inn
when on that shivering winters night the pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves who should i see standing at her helm but bulkington
i looked with sympathetic awe and upon the man who in midwinter just landed from a four years dangerous voyage could so push off again for still another tempestuous term
the land seemed scorching to his feet
things are ever the deep memories yield no epitaphs this chapter is the grave of bulkington
let me only say that it fared with him as with the ship that miserably drives along the leeward land
the port would fain give succor the port is pitiful in the port is safety comfort hearthstone supper warm blankets friends all thats kind to our mortalities
but in that gale the port the land is that ships jeopardy she must fly all hospitality one touch of land though it but graze the keel would make her shudder through and through
with all her might she crowds all sail off shore in so doing fights the very winds that fain would blow her homeward seeks all the lashed seas again for refuges sake rushing into peril her only friend her bitterest foe
know ye now bulkington
glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous slavish shore
but as in alone resides highest truth indefinite as better is it to perish in that howling infinite than be dashed upon the lee even if that were safety
for then oh
who would craven crawl to land
terrors of the terrible
is all this agony so vain
take heart take heart o bulkington
bear thee grimly demigod
up from the spray of thy up leaps thy apotheosis
chapter 24
the advocate
as and i are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among as a rather and disreputable pursuit therefore i am all anxiety to convince ye ye of the injustice hereby to us hunters of whales
in the first place it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact that among people at large the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions
if a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits were he presented to the company as a say and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials swf
sperm whale fishery to his visiting card such a procedure would be deemed presuming and ridiculous
doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us is this they think that at best our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business and that when actively engaged therein we are surrounded by all manner of defilements
butchers we are that is true
but butchers also and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all martial commanders whom the world invariably delights to honour
and as for the matter of the alleged of our business ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the sperm at least among the things of this tidy earth
but even granting the charge in question to be true what disordered slippery decks of a are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battlefields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies plaudits
and if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldiers profession let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whales vast tail fanning into eddies the air over his head
for what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of god
but though the world scouts at us whale hunters yet does it unwittingly pay us the homage yea an adoration
for almost all the tapers lamps and candles that burn round the globe burn as before so many shrines to our glory
but look at this matter in other lights weigh it in all sorts of scales see what we are and have been
why did the dutch in de witts time have admirals of their whaling fleets
why did louis xvi
of france at his own personal expense fit out whaling ships from dunkirk and politely invite to that town some score or two of families from our own island of nantucket
why did britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her in bounties upwards of
and lastly how comes it that we of america now outnumber all the rest of the banded in the world sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels manned by eighteen thousand men yearly consuming 4000000 of dollars the ships worth at the time of sailing 20000000
and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of 7000000
how comes all this if there be not something puissant in whaling
but this is not the half look again
i freely assert that the philosopher cannot for his life point out one single peaceful influence which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world taken in one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling
one way and another it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues that whaling may well be regarded as that egyptian mother who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb
it would be a hopeless endless task to catalogue all these things
let a handful suffice
for many years past the has been the pioneer in out the remotest and least known parts of the earth
she has explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart where no cook or vancouver had ever sailed
if american and european now peacefully ride in once savage harbors let them fire salutes to the honour and glory of the which originally showed them the way and first interpreted between them and the savages
they may celebrate as they will the heroes of exploring expeditions your cooks your but i say that scores of anonymous captains have sailed out of nantucket that were as great and greater than your cook and your krusenstern
for in their they in the waters and by the beaches of unrecorded javelin islands battled with virgin wonders and terrors that cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared
all that is made such a flourish of in the old south sea voyages those things were but the lifetime of our heroic
often adventures which vancouver dedicates three chapters to these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ships common log
ah the world
oh the world
until the whale fishery rounded cape horn no commerce but colonial scarcely any intercourse but colonial was carried on between europe and the long line of the opulent spanish provinces on the pacific coast
it was the who first broke through the jealous policy of the spanish crown touching those colonies and if space permitted it might be distinctly shown how from those at last eventuated the liberation of peru chili and bolivia from the yoke of old spain and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts
that great america on the other side of the sphere australia was given to the enlightened world by the
after its first discovery by a dutchman all other ships long shunned those shores as barbarous but the touched there
the is the true mother of that now mighty colony

but if in the face of all this you still declare that whaling has no aesthetically noble associations connected with it then am i ready to shiver fifty lances with you there and you with a split helmet every time
the whale has no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler you will say
the whale no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler

whaling not respectable
whaling is imperial

i know a man that in his lifetime has taken three hundred and fifty whales
i account that man more honourable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns
and as for me if by any possibility there be any as yet undiscovered prime thing in me if i shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world which i might not be unreasonably ambitious of if hereafter i shall do anything that upon the whole a man might rather have than to have left if at my death my executors or more properly my creditors find any precious mss

postscript
in behalf of the dignity of whaling i would fain advance naught but substantiated facts
but after his facts an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise which might tell eloquently upon his an advocate would he not be blameworthy
it is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens even modern ones a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through
there is a of state so called and there may be a castor of state
how they use the salt knows
certain i am however that a kings head is solemnly oiled at his coronation even as a head of salad
can it be though that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well as they anoint machinery
much might be here concerning the essential dignity of this regal process because in common life we esteem but and a fellow who his hair and palpably smells of that anointing
in truth a mature man who uses unless medicinally that man has probably got a spot in him somewhere
as a general rule he cant amount to much in his totality
but the only thing to be considered here is kind of oil is used at coronations
certainly it cannot be olive oil nor macassar oil nor castor oil nor bears oil nor train oil nor oil
what then can it possibly be but sperm oil in its unpolluted state the sweetest of all oils
think of that ye loyal britons
we supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff

knights and squires
the chief mate of the pequod was starbuck a native of nantucket and a quaker by descent
he was a long earnest man and though born on an icy coast seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes his flesh being hard as biscuit
transported to the indies his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale
he must have been born in some time of general drought and famine or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous
only some thirty arid summers had he seen those summers had dried up all his physical
but this his thinness so to speak seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight
it was merely the condensation of the man
he was by no means quite the contrary
his pure tight skin was an excellent fit and closely wrapped up in it and embalmed with inner health and strength like a egyptian this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come and to endure always as now for be it polar snow or torrid sun like a patent chronometer his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates
looking into his eyes you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those perils he had calmly confronted through life
a staid steadfast man whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action and not a tame chapter of sounds
yet for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude there were certain qualities in him which at times affected and in some cases seemed well nigh to all the rest
uncommonly conscientious for a seaman and with a deep natural reverence the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition but to that sort of superstition which in some organizations seems rather to spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance
outward portents and inward were his
and if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul much more did his faraway domestic memories of his young cape wife and child tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature and open him still further to those latent influences which in some men restrain the gush of daredevil daring so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery
i will have no man in my boat said starbuck who is not afraid of a whale
by this he seemed to mean not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward
aye aye said stubb the second mate starbuck there is as careful a man as youll find anywhere in this fishery
but we shall ere long see what that word careful precisely means when used by a man like stubb or almost any other whale hunter
starbuck was no crusader after perils in him courage was not a sentiment but a thing simply useful to him and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions
besides he thought perhaps that in this business of whaling courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishly wasted
wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sundown nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him
for thought starbuck i am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living and not to be killed by them for theirs and that hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck well knew
what doom was his own fathers
where in the bottomless deeps could he find the torn limbs of his brother
with memories like these in him and moreover given to a certain as has been said the courage of this starbuck which could nevertheless still flourish must indeed have been extreme
but it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had it was not in nature that these things should fail in engendering an element in him which under suitable circumstances would break out from its confinement and burn all his courage up
and brave as he might be it was that sort of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid men which while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas or winds or whales or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world yet cannot withstand those more terrific because more spiritual terrors which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man
but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the complete of poor starbucks fortitude scarce might i have the heart to write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking to expose the fall of valour in the soul
men may seem detestable as joint and nations knaves fools and murderers there may be men may have mean and meagre faces but man in the ideal is so noble and so sparkling such a grand and glowing creature that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes
that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves so far within us that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone bleeds with keenest anguish at the spectacle of a man
nor can piety itself at such a shameful sight completely stifle her against the permitting stars
but this august dignity i treat of is not the dignity of kings and robes but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture
thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike that democratic dignity which on all hands radiates without end from god himself
the great god absolute
the centre and circumference of all democracy
his omnipresence our divine equality
if then to meanest mariners and renegades and castaways i shall hereafter ascribe high qualities though dark weave round them tragic graces if even the most mournful perchance the most among them all shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts if i shall touch that workmans arm with some ethereal light if i shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun then against all mortal critics bear me out in it thou just spirit of equality which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind
bear me out in it thou great democratic god
who didst not refuse to the swart convict bunyan the pale poetic pearl thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold the stumped and arm of old cervantes thou who didst pick up andrew jackson from the pebbles who didst hurl him upon a warhorse who didst thunder him higher than a throne
thou who in all thy mighty earthly ever thy champions from the kingly commons bear me out in it o god
chapter 27
knights and squires
stubb was the second mate
he was a native of cape cod and hence according to local usage was called a
a neither craven nor valiant taking perils as they came with an indifferent air and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase toiling away calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year
easy and careless he presided over his whaleboat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner and his crew all invited guests
he was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat as an old is about the of his box
when close to the whale in the very of the fight he handled his lance coolly and as a whistling tinker his hammer
he would hum over his old tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster
long usage had for this stubb converted the jaws of death into an easy chair
what he thought of death itself there is no telling
whether he ever thought of it at all might be a question but if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and themselves there about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order and not sooner
what perhaps with other things made stubb such an easygoing man so off with the burden of life in a world full of grave pedlars all bowed to the ground with their packs what helped to bring about that almost impious of his that thing must have been his pipe
for like his nose his short black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face
you would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe
he kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded stuck in a rack within easy reach of his hand and whenever he turned in he smoked them all out in succession lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter then loading them again to be in readiness anew
for when stubb dressed instead of first putting his legs into his he put his pipe into his mouth
i say this continual smoking must have been one cause at least of his peculiar disposition for every one knows that this earthly air whether ashore or afloat is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it and as in time of the cholera some people go about with a handkerchief to their mouths so likewise against all mortal tribulations stubbs tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent
the third mate was flask a native of tisbury in marthas vineyard
a short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whales who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him and therefore it was a sort of point of honour with him to destroy them whenever encountered
so utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them that in his poor opinion the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse or at least requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil
this ignorant unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little in the matter of whales he followed these fish for the fun of it and a three years voyage round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time
as a carpenters nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails so mankind may be similarly divided
little flask was one of the wrought ones made to clinch tight and last long
they called him kingpost on board of the pequod because in form he could be well likened to the short square timber known by that name in arctic whalers and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas
now these three stubb and flask were momentous men
they it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the boats as
in that grand order of battle in which captain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales these three were as captains of companies
or being armed with their long keen whaling spears they were as a picked trio of lancers even as the were of javelins
and since in this famous fishery each mate or like a gothic knight of old is always accompanied by his or who in certain provides him with a fresh lance when the former one has been badly twisted or elbowed in the assault and moreover as there generally subsists between the two a close intimacy and friendliness it is therefore but meet that in this place we set down who the were and to what each of them belonged
first of all was whom starbuck the chief mate had selected for his squire
but is already known
next was tashtego an unmixed indian from gay head the most westerly promontory of marthas vineyard where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men which has long supplied the neighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daring
in the fishery they usually go by the generic name of
long lean sable hair his high cheek bones and black rounding an indian oriental in their but antarctic in their glittering this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the blood of those proud warrior hunters who in quest of the great new england moose had scoured bow in hand the aboriginal forests of the main
but no longer in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea the unerring harpoon of the son replacing the infallible arrow of the sires
to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe limbs you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier puritans and this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the powers of the air
tashtego was stubb the second mates squire
third among the was daggoo a gigantic with a ahasuerus to behold
suspended from his ears were two golden hoops so large that the sailors called them and would talk of securing the topsail to them
in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler lying in a lonely bay on his native coast
and never having been anywhere in the world but in africa nantucket and the pagan harbors most frequented by and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly of what manner of men they shipped daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues and erect as a giraffe moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks
there was a corporeal humility in looking up at him and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress
curious to tell this imperial negro ahasuerus daggoo was the squire of little flask who looked like a chessman beside him
as for the residue of the company be it said that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the american whale fishery are americans born though pretty nearly all the officers are
herein it is the same with the american whale fishery as with the american army and military and merchant navies and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the american canals and railroads
the same i say because in all these cases the native american liberally provides the brains the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles
no small number of these whaling seamen belong to the azores where the outward bound nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores
in like manner the greenland whalers sailing out of hull or put in at the shetland islands to receive the full complement of their crew
upon the passage they drop them there again
how it is there is no telling but islanders seem to make the best
they were nearly all islanders in the pequod too i call such not acknowledging the common continent of men but each living on a separate continent of his own
yet now federated along one keel what a set these were
an deputation from all the isles of the sea and all the ends of the earth accompanying old ahab in the pequod to lay the worlds grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back
black little never no
he went before
poor alabama boy
on the grim forecastle ye shall ere long see him beating his tambourine of the eternal time when sent for to the great quarterdeck on high he was bid strike in with angels and beat his tambourine in glory called a coward here hailed a hero there
chapter 28
ahab
for several days after leaving nantucket nothing above hatches was seen of captain ahab
the mates regularly relieved each other at the watches and for aught that could be seen to the contrary they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously
yes their supreme lord and dictator was there though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin
every time i ascended to the deck from my watches below i instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible for my first vague touching the unknown captain now in the seclusion of the sea became almost a perturbation
this was strangely heightened at times by the ragged elijahs diabolical recurring to me with a subtle energy i could not have before conceived of
but poorly could i withstand them much as in other moods i was almost ready to smile at the solemn of that outlandish prophet of the wharves
but whatever it was of or call it i felt yet whenever i came to look about me in the ship it seemed against all to cherish such emotions
for though the with the great body of the crew were a far more barbaric and motley set than any of the tame companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with still i ascribed rightly ascribed the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation in which i had so embarked
but it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship the mates which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage
three better more likely and men each in his own different way could not readily be found and they were every one of them americans a a a cape man
now it being christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor for a space we had biting polar weather though all the time running away from it to the southward and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed gradually leaving that merciless winter and all its intolerable weather behind us
it was one of those less lowering but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity that as i mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon as i levelled my glance towards the foreboding shivers ran over me
reality outran apprehension captain ahab stood upon his quarterdeck
there seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him nor of the recovery from any
he looked like a man cut away from the stake when the fire has wasted all the limbs without consuming them or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness
his whole high broad form seemed made of solid bronze and shaped in an unalterable mould like cast perseus
threading its way out from among his grey hairs and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck till it disappeared in his clothing you saw a slender mark whitish
it resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight lofty trunk of a great tree when the upper lightning darts down it and without wrenching a single twig peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom ere running off into the soil leaving the tree still greenly alive but branded
whether that mark was born with him or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound no one could certainly say
by some tacit consent throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it especially by the mates
but once senior an old indian among the crew asserted that not till he was full forty years old did ahab become that way branded and then it came upon him not in the fury of any mortal fray but in an elemental strife at sea
yet this wild hint seemed by what a grey manxman insinuated an old sepulchral man who having never before sailed out of nantucket had never ere this laid eye upon wild ahab
nevertheless the old the immemorial popularly invested this old manxman with preternatural powers of discernment
so that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever captain ahab should be laid might hardly come to pass so he whoever should do that last office for the dead would find a birthmark on him from crown to sole
so powerfully did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect me and the livid brand which streaked it that for the first few moments i hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood
it had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whales jaw
aye he was dismasted off japan said the old indian once but like his dismasted craft he shipped another mast without coming home for it
he has a quiver of em
i was struck with the singular posture he maintained
upon each side of the quarter deck and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds there was an auger hole bored about half an inch or so into the plank
his bone leg steadied in that hole one arm elevated and holding by a shroud captain ahab stood erect looking straight out beyond the ships prow
there was an infinity of fortitude a determinate in the fixed and fearless forward dedication of that glance
not a word he spoke nor did his officers say aught to him though by all their gestures and expressions they plainly showed the uneasy if not painful consciousness of being under a troubled
and not only that but moody stricken ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe
ere long from his first visit in the air he withdrew into his cabin
but after that morning he was every day visible to the crew either standing in his or seated upon an ivory stool he had or heavily walking the deck
as the sky grew less gloomy indeed began to grow a little genial he became still less and less a recluse as if when the ship had sailed from home nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded
and by and by it came to pass that he was almost continually in the air but as yet for all that he said or perceptibly did on the at last sunny deck he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast
but the pequod was only making a passage now not regularly cruising nearly all whaling needing supervision the mates were fully competent to so that there was little or nothing out of himself to employ or excite ahab now and thus chase away for that one interval the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow as ever all clouds choose the peaks to pile themselves upon
nevertheless ere long the warm warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant holiday weather we came to seemed gradually to charm him from his mood
for as when the dancing girls april and may trip home to the wintry misanthropic woods even the barest most old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts to welcome such so ahab did in the end a little respond to the playful of that girlish air
more than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look which in any other man would have soon flowered out in a smile
chapter 29
enter ahab to him stubb
some days elapsed and ice and icebergs all astern the pequod now went rolling through the bright quito spring which at sea almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal august of the tropic
the warmly cool clear ringing perfumed overflowing redundant days were as crystal goblets of persian sherbet heaped up with rosewater snow
the starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets nursing at home in lonely pride the memory of their absent conquering earls the golden helmeted suns
for sleeping man twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights
but all the of that weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world
inward they turned upon the soul especially when the still mild hours of eve came on then memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights
and all these subtle agencies more and more they wrought on ahabs texture
old age is always wakeful as if the longer linked with life the less man has to do with aught that looks like death
among the old will leave their berths to visit the deck
it was so with ahab only that now of late he seemed so much to live in the open air that truly speaking his visits were more to the cabin than from the cabin to the planks
it feels like going down into ones would mutter to an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle to go to my berth
so almost every hours when the watches of the night were set and the band on deck the slumbers of the band below and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle the sailors flung it not rudely down as by day but with some it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail habitually the silent steersman would watch the and ere long the old man would emerge gripping at the iron banister to help his crippled way
some considering touch of humanity was in him for at times like these he usually abstained from patrolling the quarterdeck because to his wearied mates seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks
but once the mood was on him too deep for common and as with heavy pace he was measuring the ship from to mainmast stubb the old second mate came up from below with a certain deprecating hinted that if captain ahab was pleased to walk the planks then no one could say nay but there might be some way of the noise hinting something indistinctly and about a globe of tow and the insertion into it of the ivory heel
ah
stubb thou didst not know ahab then
am i a cannonball stubb said ahab that thou wad me that fashion
but go thy ways i had forgot
below to thy nightly grave where such as ye sleep between shrouds to use ye to the filling one at dog and kennel
starting at the concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man stubb was speechless a moment then said excitedly i am not used to be spoken to that way sir i do but less than half like it sir
avast
ahab between his set teeth and violently moving away as if to avoid some passionate temptation
no sir not yet said stubb emboldened i will not be called a dog sir
then be called ten times a and a mule and an ass and or ill clear the world of thee
as he said this ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect that stubb involuntarily retreated
i was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it muttered stubb as he found himself descending the
its very queer
stop stubb somehow now i well know whether to go back and strike him here on my knees and pray for him
yes that was the thought coming up in me but it would be the first time i ever did pray
its queer very queer and hes queer too aye take him fore and aft hes about the old man stubb ever sailed with
how he flashed at eyes like
is he mad
anyway theres something on his mind as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks
he aint in his bed now either more than three hours out of the and he sleep then
didnt that doughboy the steward tell me that of a morning he always finds the old mans hammock clothes all and tumbled and the sheets down at the foot and the almost tied into knots and the pillow a sort of frightful hot as though a baked brick had been on it
a hot old man
i guess hes got what some folks ashore call a conscience its a kind of they nor a toothache
well well i know what it is but the lord keep me from catching it
hes full of riddles i wonder what he goes into the after hold for every night as doughboy tells me he suspects whats that for i should like to know
whos made appointments with him in the hold
aint that queer now
but theres no telling its the old goes for a snooze
damn me its worth a fellows while to be born into the world if only to fall right asleep
and now that i think of it thats about the first thing babies do and thats a sort of queer too
damn me but all things are queer come to think of em
but thats against my principles
think not is my eleventh commandment and sleep when you can is my here goes again
but hows that
didnt he call me a dog
blazes
he called me ten times a and piled a lot of on top of that
he might as well have kicked me and with it
maybe he did kick me and i didnt observe it i was so taken all aback with his brow somehow
it flashed like a bleached bone
what the devils the matter with me
i stand right on my legs
coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out
by the lord i must have been dreaming
how
the only ways to stash it so here goes to hammock again and in the morning ill see how this juggling thinks over by daylight
chapter 30
the pipe
when stubb had departed ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks and then as had been usual with him of late calling a sailor of the watch he sent him below for his ivory stool and also his pipe
lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck he sat and smoked
in old norse times the thrones of the danish kings were fabricated saith tradition of the tusks of the
how could one look at ahab then seated on that tripod of bones without him of the royalty it symbolized
for a khan of the plank and a king of the sea and a great lord of leviathans was ahab
some moments passed during which the thick vapour came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs which blew back again into his face
how now he at last withdrawing the tube this smoking no longer soothes
oh my pipe
hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone
here have i been unconsciously toiling not and smoking to windward all the while to windward and with such nervous as if like the dying whale my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble
what business have i with this pipe
this thing that is meant for to send up mild white vapours among mild white hairs not among torn locks like mine
ill smoke no more he tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea
the fire hissed in the waves the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made
with hat ahab paced the planks
chapter 31
queen mab
next morning stubb accosted flask
such a queer dream kingpost i never had
you know the old mans ivory leg well i dreamed he kicked me with it and when i tried to kick back upon my soul my little man i kicked my leg right off
and then presto
ahab seemed a pyramid and i like a blazing fool kept kicking at it
but what was still more curious know how curious all dreams all this rage that i was in i somehow seemed to be thinking to myself that after all it was not much of an insult that kick from ahab
why thinks i whats the row
its not a real leg only a false leg
and theres a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump
thats what makes a blow from the hand flask fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane
the living makes the living insult my little man
and thinks i to myself all the while mind while i was my silly toes against that cursed contradictory was it all all the while i say i was thinking to myself whats his leg now but a whalebone cane
yes thinks i it was only a playful fact only a that he gave a base kick
besides thinks i look at it once why the end of itthe foot a small sort of end it is whereas if a broad footed farmer kicked me theres a devilish broad insult
but this insult is whittled down to a point only
but now comes the greatest joke of the dream flask
while i was battering away at the pyramid a sort of old merman with a hump on his back takes me by the shoulders and me round
what are you bout
says he
slid
man but i was frightened
such a
but somehow next moment i was over the fright
what am i about
says i at last
and what business is that of yours i should like to know mr humpback
do you want a kick
by the lord flask i had no sooner said that than he turned round his stern to me bent over and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a do you think i thunder alive man his stern was stuck full of with the points out
says i on second thoughts i guess i wont kick you old fellow
wise stubb said he wise stubb and kept muttering it all the time a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag
seeing he wasnt going to stop saying over his wise stubb wise stubb i thought i might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again
but i had only just lifted my foot for it when he roared out stop that kicking
says i whats the matter now old fellow
look ye here says he lets argue the insult
captain ahab kicked ye didnt he
yes he did says here it was
very good says hehe used his ivory leg didnt he
yes he did says i
well then says he wise stubb what have you to complain of
didnt he kick with right good will
it wasnt a common pitch pine leg he kicked with was it
no you were kicked by a great man and with a beautiful ivory leg stubb
its an honour i consider it an honour
listen wise stubb
in old england the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen and made of but be your boast stubb that ye were kicked by old ahab and made a wise man of
remember what i say be kicked by him account his kicks honours and on no account kick back for you cant help yourself wise stubb
you see that pyramid
with that he all of a sudden seemed somehow in some queer fashion to swim off into the air
i rolled over and there i was in my hammock
now what do you think of that dream flask
i know it seems a sort of foolish to me tho
may be may be
but its made a wise man of me flask
dye see ahab standing there sideways looking over the stern
well the best thing you can do flask is to let the old man alone never speak to him whatever he says

whats that he shouts
hark
masthead there
look sharp all of ye
there are whales
if ye see a white one split your lungs for him
what do you think of that now flask
aint there a small drop of something queer about that eh
a white ye mark that man
look something special in the wind
stand by for it flask
ahab has that thats bloody on his mind
but mum he comes this way
chapter 32

already we are boldly launched upon the deep but soon we shall be lost in its
ere that come to pass ere the weedy hull rolls side by side with the hulls of the leviathan at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow
it is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera that i would now fain put before you
yet is it no easy task
the classification of the constituents of a chaos nothing less is here essayed
listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down
no branch of zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled says captain scoresby ad 1820
it is not my intention were it in my power to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal sperm whale says surgeon beale ad 1839
unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters
impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea
a field strewn with thorns
all these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists
thus speak of the whale the great cuvier and john hunter and lesson those lights of zoology and anatomy
nevertheless though of real knowledge there be little yet of books there are a plenty and so in some small degree with or the science of whales
many are the men small and great old and new and seamen who have at large or in little written of the whale
run over a authors of the bible aristotle pliny aldrovandi sir thomas browne gesner ray linnaeus willoughby green sibbald brisson marten baron cuvier frederick cuvier john hunter owen scoresby beale bennett j ross browne the author of miriam coffin olmstead and the rev
t cheever
but to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written the above cited extracts will show
of the names in this list of whale authors only those following owen ever saw living whales and but one of them was a real professional and
i mean captain scoresby
on the separate subject of the greenland or he is the best existing authority
but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning
and here be it said that the greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas
he is not even by any means the largest of the whales
yet owing to the long priority of his claims and the profound ignorance which till some seventy years back invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and this usurpation has been every way complete
reference to nearly all the allusions in the great poets of past days will satisfy you that the greenland whale without one rival was to them the monarch of the seas
but the time has at last come for a new proclamation
this is charing cross hear ye
good people greenland whale is great sperm whale now
there are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you and at the same time in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt
those books are beales and bennetts both in their time surgeons to english southsea whaleships and both exact and reliable men
the original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small but so far as it goes it is of excellent quality though mostly confined to scientific description
as yet however the sperm whale scientific or poetic lives not complete in any literature
far above all other hunted whales his is an unwritten life
now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification if only an easy outline one for the present hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers
as no better man advances to take this matter in hand i offer my own poor endeavors
i promise nothing complete because any human thing supposed to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty
i shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species orin this place at much of any description
my object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of
i am the architect not the builder
but it is a ponderous task no ordinary in the is equal to it
to grope down into the bottom of the sea after them to have ones hands among the unspeakable foundations ribs and very pelvis of the world this is a fearful thing
what am i that i should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan
the awful in job might well me
will he the leviathan make a covenant with thee
behold the hope of him is vain
but i have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans i have had to do with whales with these visible hands i am in earnest and i will try
there are some preliminaries to settle
first the uncertain unsettled condition of this science of is in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish
in his system of nature ad 1776 linnaeus declares i hereby separate the whales from the fish
but of my own knowledge i know that down to the year 1850 sharks and shad and herring against linnaeuss express edict were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the leviathan
the grounds upon which linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from the waters he states as follows on account of their warm heart their lungs their movable eyelids their hollow ears and finally ex lege naturae jure
i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charley coffin of nantucket both of mine in a certain voyage and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient
charley hinted they were humbug
be it known that waiving all argument i take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish and call upon holy jonah to back me
this fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish
above linnaeus has given you those items
but in brief they are these lungs and warm blood whereas all other fish are lungless and cold blooded
next how shall we define the whale by his obvious externals so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come
to be short then a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail
there you have him
however contracted that definition is the result of expanded meditation
a walrus spouts much like a whale but the walrus is not a fish because he is amphibious
but the last term of the definition is still more cogent as coupled with the first
almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to have not a flat but a vertical or tail
whereas among spouting fish the tail though it may be similarly shaped invariably assumes a horizontal position
by the above definition of what a whale is i do by no means exclude from the brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed nor on the other hand link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien
hence all the smaller spouting and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this of
now then come the grand divisions of the entire whale host
i am aware that down to the present time the fish styled and dugongs and of the coffins of nantucket are included by many naturalists among the whales
but as these are a noisy contemptible set mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers and feeding on wet hay and especially as they do not spout i deny their credentials as whales and have presented them with their passports to quit the kingdom of
first according to magnitude i divide the whales into three primary books into chapters and these shall comprehend them all both small and large

folio chapter i
sperm whale among the english of old vaguely known as the whale and the whale and the anvil headed whale is the present cachalot of the french and the of the germans and the macrocephalus of the long words
he is without doubt the largest inhabitant of the globe the most formidable of all whales to encounter the most majestic in aspect and lastly by far the most valuable in commerce he being the only creature from which that valuable substance spermaceti is obtained
all his peculiarities will in many other places be enlarged upon
it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do
considered it is absurd
some centuries ago when the sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish in those days spermaceti it would seem was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in england as the greenland or right whale
it was the idea also that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses
in those times also spermaceti was exceedingly scarce not being used for light but only as an ointment and
it was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb
when as i opine in the course of time the true nature of spermaceti became known its original name was still retained by the dealers no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity
and so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived
book i
folio chapter ii
right one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans being the one first regularly hunted by man
it yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen and the oil specially known as whale oil an inferior article in commerce
among the fishermen he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles the whale the greenland whale the black whale the great whale the true whale the right whale
there is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus baptised
what then is the whale which i include in the second species of my folios
it is the great of the english naturalists the greenland whale of the english the ordinaire of the french the of the swedes
it is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the dutch and english in the arctic seas it is the whale which the american fishermen have long pursued in the indian ocean on the brazil banks on the nor west coast and various other parts of the world designated by them right whale cruising grounds
some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of the english and the right whale of the americans
but they precisely agree in all their grand features nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction
it is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences that some departments of natural history become so intricate
the right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length with reference to elucidating the sperm whale
book i
folio chapter iii
this head i reckon a monster which by the various names of and has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often by passengers crossing the atlantic in the new york
in the length he attains and in his baleen the resembles the right whale but is of a less portly girth and a lighter colour approaching to olive
his great lips present a aspect formed by the slanting folds of large wrinkles
his grand distinguishing feature the fin from which he derives his name is often a conspicuous object
this fin is some three or four feet long growing vertically from the hinder part of the back of an angular shape and with a very sharp pointed end
even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible this isolated fin will at times be seen plainly projecting from the surface
when the sea is moderately calm and slightly marked with spherical ripples and this fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial with its style and wavy on it
on that the shadow often goes back
the is not gregarious
he seems a as some men are
very shy always going solitary unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming as to defy all present pursuit from man this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable cain of his race bearing for his mark that style upon his back
from having the baleen in his mouth the is sometimes included with the right whale among a theoretic species denominated whalebone whales that is whales with baleen
of these so called whalebone whales there would seem to be several varieties most of which however are little known
whales and beaked whales whales bunched whales whales and whales are the fishermens names for a few sorts
in connection with this of whalebone whales it is of great importance to mention that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan founded upon either his baleen or hump or fin or teeth notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of than any other detached bodily distinctions which the whale in his kinds presents
how then
the baleen hump and teeth these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars
thus the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale each has a hump but there the similitude ceases
then this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale each of these has baleen but there again the similitude ceases
and it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned
in various sorts of whales they form such irregular combinations or in the case of any one of them detached such an irregular isolation as utterly to defy all general formed upon such a basis
on this rock every one of the has split
but it may possibly be conceived that in the internal parts of the whale in his at least we shall be able to hit the right classification
nay what thing for example is there in the greenland whales anatomy more striking than his baleen
yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the greenland whale
and if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the as those external ones already enumerated
what then remains
nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily in their entire liberal volume and boldly sort them that way
and this is the bibliographical system here adopted and it is the only one that can possibly succeed for it alone is practicable
to proceed
book i
folio chapter iv
whale is often seen on the northern american coast
he has been frequently captured there and towed into harbor
he has a great pack on him like a peddler or you might call him the elephant and castle whale
at any rate the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one
his oil is not very valuable
he has baleen
he is the most and lighthearted of all the whales making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them
book i
folio chapter v
this whale little is known but his name
i have seen him at a distance off cape horn
of a retiring nature he eludes both hunters and philosophers
though no coward he has never yet shown any part of him but his back which rises in a long sharp ridge
let him go
i know little more of him nor does anybody else
book i
folio chapter vi
retiring gentleman with a brimstone belly doubtless got by scraping along the tiles in some of his
he is seldom seen at least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance
he is never chased he would run away with of line
prodigies are told of him
adieu sulphur bottom
i can say nothing more that is true of ye nor can the oldest
thus ends book i
folio and now begins book ii
octavo

these embrace the whales of middling magnitude among which present may be the grampus ii the black fish iii the iv the thrasher v the killer
why this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plain
because while the whales of this order though smaller than those of the former order nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure yet the bookbinders quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the folio volume but the octavo volume does
book ii
octavo chapter i
this fish whose loud sonorous breathing or rather blowing has furnished a proverb to is so well known a denizen of the deep yet is he not popularly classed among whales
but possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan most naturalists have recognised him for one
he is of moderate octavo size varying from fifteen to feet in length and of corresponding dimensions round the waist
he swims in herds he is never regularly hunted though his oil is considerable in quantity and pretty good for light
by some fishermen his approach is regarded as of the advance of the great sperm whale
book ii
octavo chapter ii
black give the popular fishermens names for all these fish for generally they are the best
where any name happens to be vague or i shall say so and suggest another
i do so now touching the black fish socalled because blackness is the rule among almost all whales
so call him the hyena whale if you please
his is well known and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards he carries an everlasting grin on his face
this whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length
he is found in almost all latitudes
he has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming which looks something like a roman nose
when not more profitably employed the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the hyena whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic some frugal housekeepers in the absence of company and quite alone by themselves burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax
though their blubber is very thin some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil
book ii
octavo chapter iii
that is nostril instance of a curiously named whale so named i suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose
the creature is some sixteen feet in length while its horn averages five feet though some exceed ten and even attain to fifteen feet
strictly speaking this horn is but a lengthened tusk growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal
but it is only found on the sinister side which has an ill effect giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy man
what precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers it would be hard to say
it does not seem to be used like the blade of the swordfish and billfish though some sailors tell me that the employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food
charley coffin said it was used for an for the rising to the surface of the polar sea and finding it sheeted with ice thrusts his horn up and so breaks through
but you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct
my own opinion is that however this horn may really be used by the that may beit would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets
the i have heard called the tusked whale the horned whale and the unicorn whale
he is certainly a curious example of the to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature
from certain cloistered old authors i have gathered that this same horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison and as such preparations of it brought immense prices
it was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn
originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity
black letter tells me that sir martin frobisher on his return from that voyage when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of greenwich palace as his bold ship sailed down the thames when sir martin returned from that voyage saith black letter on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the which for a long period after hung in the castle at windsor
an irish author avers that the earl of leicester on bended knees did likewise present to her highness another horn pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature
the has a very picturesque look being of a ground colour dotted with round and oblong spots of black
his oil is very superior clear and fine but there is little of it and he is seldom hunted
he is mostly found in the circumpolar seas
book ii
octavo chapter iv
this whale little is precisely known to the and nothing at all to the professed naturalist
from what i have seen of him at a distance i should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus
he is very sort of fish
he sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip and hangs there like a leech till the mighty brute is worried to death
the killer is never hunted
i never heard what sort of oil he has
exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale on the ground of its
for we are all killers on land and on sea bonapartes and sharks included
book ii
octavo chapter v
gentleman is famous for his tail which he uses for a in thrashing his foes
he mounts the folio whales back and as he swims he works his passage by flogging him as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process
still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer
both are outlaws even in the lawless seas
thus ends book ii

the porpoise
to those who have not chanced specially to study the subject it may possibly seem strange that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among word which in the popular sense always conveys an idea of
but the creatures set down above as are infallibly whales by the terms of my definition of what a whale
a spouting fish with a horizontal tail
book iii
chapter 1
is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe
the name is of my own bestowal for there are more than one sort of porpoises and something must be to distinguish them
i call him thus because he always swims in hilarious shoals which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a crowd
their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner
full of fine spirits they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward
they are the lads that always live before the wind
they are accounted a lucky omen
if you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish then heaven help ye the spirit of godly is not in ye
a plump porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil
but the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable
it is in request among jewellers and watchmakers
sailors put it on their hones
porpoise meat is good eating you know
it may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts
indeed his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible
but the next time you have a chance watch him and you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniature

algerine pirate
very savage

book iii
chapter iii
largest kind of porpoise and only found in the pacific so far as it is known
the only english name by which he has hitherto been designated is that of the porpoise from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio
in shape he differs in some degree from the porpoise being of a less rotund and jolly girth indeed he is of quite a neat and figure
he has no fins on his back most other porpoises have he has a lovely tail and sentimental indian eyes of a hazel hue
but his spoils all
though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable yet a boundary line distinct as the mark in a ships hull called the bright waist that line streaks him from stem to stern with two separate colours black above and white below
the white comprises part of his head and the whole of his mouth which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a
a most mean and mealy aspect
his oil is much like that of the common porpoise
beyond the this system does not proceed inasmuch as the porpoise is the smallest of the whales
above you have all the leviathans of note
but there are a rabble of uncertain fugitive whales which as an american i know by reputation but not personally
i shall enumerate them by their forecastle appellations for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators who may complete what i have here but begun
if any of the following whales shall hereafter be caught and marked then he can readily be incorporated into this system according to his folio octavo or bottlenose whale the junk whale the whale the cape whale the leading whale the cannon whale the whale the coppered whale the elephant whale the iceberg whale the whale the blue whale etc
from icelandic dutch and old english authorities there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales blessed with all manner of uncouth names
but i omit them as altogether obsolete and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds full of but signifying nothing
finally it was stated at the outset that this system would not be here and at once perfected
you cannot but plainly see that i have kept my word
but i now leave my system standing thus unfinished even as the great cathedral of cologne was left with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower
for small erections may be finished by their first architects grand ones true ones ever leave the to posterity
god keep me from ever completing anything
this whole book is but a but the draught of a draught
oh time strength cash and patience
chapter 33
the
concerning the officers of the this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on shipboard arising from the existence of the class of officers a class unknown of course in any other marine than the
the large importance attached to the vocation is evinced by the fact that originally in the old dutch fishery two centuries and more ago the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain but was divided between him and an officer called the
literally this word means usage however in time made it equivalent to chief
in those days the captains authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel while over the department and all its concerns the or chief reigned supreme
in the british greenland fishery under the corrupted title of this old dutch official is still retained but his former dignity is sadly abridged
at present he ranks simply as senior and as such is but one of the captains more inferior subalterns
nevertheless as upon the good conduct of the the success of a whaling voyage largely depends and since in the american fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat but under certain circumstances night watches on a whaling ground the command of the ships deck is also his therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior though always by them familiarly regarded as their social equal
now the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea is first lives aft the last forward
hence in whaleships and merchantmen alike the mates have their quarters with the captain and so too in most of the american whalers the are lodged in the after part of the ship
that is to say they take their meals in the captains cabin and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it
though the long period of a southern whaling voyage by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man the peculiar perils of it and the community of interest prevailing among a company all of whom high or low depend for their profits not upon fixed wages but upon their common luck together with their common vigilance intrepidity and hard work though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally yet never mind how much like an old mesopotamian family these may in some primitive instances live together for all that the punctilious externals at least of the quarterdeck are seldom materially relaxed and in no instance away
indeed many are the nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarterdeck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy nay extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple and not the of
and though of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption and though the only homage he ever exacted was implicit instantaneous obedience though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarterdeck and though there were times when owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed he addressed them in unusual terms whether of condescension or in or otherwise yet even captain ahab was by no means of the paramount forms and usages of the sea
nor perhaps will it fail to be eventually perceived that behind those forms and usages as it were he sometimes masked himself incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to
that certain of his brain which had otherwise in a good degree remained through those forms that same became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship
for be a mans intellectual superiority what it will it can never assume the practical available supremacy over other men without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments always in themselves more or less paltry and base
this it is that for ever keeps gods true princes of the empire from the worlds hustings and leaves the highest honours that this air can give to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass
such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them that in some royal instances even to idiot they have imparted potency
but when as in the case of nicholas the czar the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain then the plebeian herds crouch before the tremendous centralization
nor will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal in its fullest sweep and direct swing ever forget a hint incidentally so important in his art as the one now alluded to
but ahab my captain still moves before me in all his nantucket and and in this episode touching emperors and kings i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old like him and therefore all outward trappings and housings are denied me
oh ahab
what shall be grand in thee it must needs be plucked at from the skies and dived for in the deep and featured in the air
chapter 34
the
it is noon and doughboy the steward thrusting his pale face from the announces dinner to his lord and master who sitting in the lee has just been taking an observation of the sun and is now reckoning the latitude on the smooth tablet reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg
from his complete inattention to the tidings you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial
but presently catching hold of the mizen shrouds he swings himself to the deck and in an even voice saying dinner starbuck disappears into the cabin
when the last echo of his sultans step has died away and starbuck the first emir has every reason to suppose that he is seated then starbuck rouses from his quietude takes a few turns along the planks and after a grave peep into the binnacle says with some touch of pleasantness dinner stubb and descends the scuttle
the second emir lounges about the rigging awhile and then slightly shaking the main brace to see whether it will be all right with that important rope he likewise takes up the old burden and with a rapid dinner mr flask follows after his predecessors
but the third emir now seeing himself all alone on the quarterdeck seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions and kicking off his shoes he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the grand turks head and then by a dexterous sleight pitching his cap up into the for a shelf he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck reversing all other processions by bringing up the rear with music
but ere stepping into the cabin doorway below he pauses ships a new face altogether and then independent hilarious little flask enters king ahabs presence in the character of or the slave
it is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense of that while in the open air of the deck some officers will upon provocation bear themselves boldly and enough towards their commander yet ten to one let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commanders cabin and straightway their inoffensive not to say and humble air towards him as he sits at the head of the table this is marvellous sometimes most comical
wherefore this difference
a problem
perhaps not
to have been belshazzar king of babylon and to have been belshazzar not but courteously therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur
but he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private of invited guests that mans unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time that mans royalty of state transcends belshazzars for belshazzar was not the greatest
who has but once dined his friends has tasted what it is to be caesar
it is a witchery of social which there is no withstanding
now if to this consideration you the official supremacy of a shipmaster then by inference you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sealife just mentioned
over his table ahab presided like a mute maned sealion on the white coral beach surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs
in his own proper turn each officer waited to be served
they were as little children before ahab and yet in ahab there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance
with one mind their intent eyes all fastened upon the old mans knife as he carved the chief dish before him
i do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation even upon so neutral a topic as the weather
no
and when reaching out his knife and fork between which the slice of beef was locked ahab thereby motioned starbucks plate towards him the mate received his meat as though receiving alms and cut it tenderly and a little started if perchance the knife grazed against the plate and chewed it and swallowed it not without
for like the coronation banquet at frankfort where the german emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial electors so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals eaten in awful silence and yet at table old ahab forbade not conversation only he himself was dumb
what a relief it was to choking stubb when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below
and poor little flask he was the youngest son and little boy of this weary family party
his were the of the saline beef his would have been the drumsticks
for flask to have presumed to help himself this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree
had he helped himself at that table doubtless never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world nevertheless strange to say ahab never forbade him
and had flask helped himself the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it
least of all did flask presume to help himself to butter
whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him on account of its clotting his clear sunny complexion or whether he deemed that on so long a voyage in such waters butter was at a premium and therefore was not for him a subaltern however it was flask alas
was a man
another thing
flask was the last person down at the dinner and flask is the first man up
consider
for hereby flasks dinner was badly jammed in point of time
starbuck and stubb both had the start of him and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear
if stubb even who is but a peg higher than flask happens to have but a small appetite and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast then flask must himself he will not get more than three that day for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck
therefore it was that flask once admitted in private that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry more or less
for what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger as keep it immortal in him
peace and satisfaction thought flask have for ever departed from my stomach
i am an officer but how i wish i could fish a bit of beef in the forecastle as i used to when i was before the mast
theres the fruits of promotion now theres the vanity of glory theres the insanity of life
besides if it were so that any mere sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flasks official capacity all that sailor had to do in order to obtain ample vengeance was to go aft at and get a peep at flask through the cabin skylight sitting silly and before awful ahab
now ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the cabin
after their departure taking place in inverted order to their arrival the canvas cloth was cleared or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward
and then the three were to the feast they being its residuary
they made a sort of temporary servants hall of the high and mighty cabin
in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible of the captains table was the entire carefree license and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the
while their masters the mates seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws the chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it
they dined like lords they filled their bellies like indian ships all day loading with spices
such portentous appetites had and tashtego that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast often the pale doughboy was fain to bring on a great baron of seemingly quarried out of the solid ox
and if he were not lively about it if he did not go with a nimble then tashtego had an way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back
and once daggoo seized with a sudden humor assisted doughboys memory by snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher while tashtego knife in hand began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him
he was naturally a very nervous shuddering sort of little fellow this steward the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse
and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages doughboys whole life was one continual
commonly after seeing the furnished with all things they demanded he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door till all was over
it was a sight to see seated over against tashtego opposing his filed teeth to the indians crosswise to them daggoo seated on the floor for a bench would have brought his head to the low at every motion of his colossal limbs making the low cabin framework to shake as when an african elephant goes passenger in a ship
but for all this the great negro was wonderfully not to say dainty
it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad baronial and superb a person
but doubtless this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds
not by beef or by bread are giants made or nourished
but he had a mortal barbaric smack of the lip in ugly sound much so that the trembling doughboy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms
and when he would hear tashtego singing out for him to produce himself that his bones might be picked the steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry by his sudden fits of the palsy
nor did the whetstone which the carried in their pockets for their lances and other weapons and with which whetstones at dinner they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives that grating sound did not at all tend to poor doughboy
how could he forget that in his island days for one must certainly have been guilty of some murderous convivial indiscretions
alas
doughboy
hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals
not a napkin should he carry on his arm but a buckler
in good time though to his great delight the three warriors would rise and depart to his credulous ears all their martial bones jingling in them at every step like moorish in scabbards
but though these barbarians dined in the cabin and nominally lived there still being anything but sedentary in their habits they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes and just before when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters
in this one matter ahab seemed no exception to most american whale captains who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ships cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is at any time permitted there
so that in real truth the mates and of the pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it
for when they did enter it it was something as a enters a house turning inwards for a moment only to be turned out the next and as a permanent thing residing in the open air
nor did they lose much hereby in the cabin was no companionship socially ahab was inaccessible
though nominally included in the census of christendom he was still an alien to it
he lived in the world as the last of the grisly bears lived in settled missouri
and as when spring and summer had departed that wild logan of the woods burying himself in the hollow of a tree lived out the winter there sucking his own paws so in his inclement howling old age ahabs soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom
chapter 35
the masthead
it was during the more pleasant weather that in due rotation with the other seamen my first masthead came round
in most american the mastheads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessels leaving her port even though she may have fifteen thousand miles and more to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground
and if after a three four or five years voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in an empty vial her mastheads are kept manned to the last and not till her sail in among the spires of the port does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more
now as the business of standing mastheads ashore or afloat is a very ancient and interesting one let us in some measure here
i take it that the earliest of mastheads were the old egyptians because in all my researches i find none prior to them
for though their progenitors the builders of babel must doubtless by their tower have intended to rear the masthead in all asia or africa either yet ere the final truck was put to it as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board in the dread gale of gods wrath therefore we cannot give these babel builders priority over the egyptians
and that the egyptians were a nation of masthead is an assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes a theory singularly supported by the peculiar formation of all four sides of those edifices whereby with prodigious long of their legs those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex and sing out for new stars even as the lookouts of a modern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bearing in sight
in saint stylites the famous christian hermit of old times who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts rain hail or sleet but valiantly facing everything out to the last literally died at his post
of modern we have but a lifeless set mere stone iron and bronze men who though well capable of facing out a stiff gale are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight
there is napoleon who upon the top of the column of vendome stands with arms folded some one hundred and fifty feet in the air careless now who rules the decks below whether louis philippe louis blanc or louis the devil
great washington too stands high aloft on his towering mainmast in baltimore and like one of hercules pillars his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go
admiral nelson also on a capstan of gunmetal stands his masthead in trafalgar square and ever when most obscured by that smoke token is yet given that a hidden hero is there for where there is smoke must be fire
but neither great washington nor napoleon nor nelson will answer a single hail from below however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze however it may be surmised that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future and what shoals and what rocks must be shunned
it may seem to couple in any respect the masthead of the land with those of the sea but that in truth it is not so is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy the sole historian of nantucket stands accountable
the worthy obed tells us that in the early times of the whale fishery ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game the people of that island erected lofty spars along the seacoast to which the lookouts ascended by means of nailed cleats something as fowls go upstairs in a henhouse
a few years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay of new zealand who upon the game gave notice to the boats nigh the beach
but this custom has now become obsolete turn we then to the one proper masthead that of a at sea
the three mastheads are kept manned from sunrise to sunset the seamen taking their regular turns as at the helm and relieving each other every two hours
in the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the masthead nay to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful
there you stand a hundred feet above the silent decks striding along the deep as if the masts were gigantic stilts while beneath you and between your legs as it were swim the monsters of the sea even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous colossus at old rhodes
there you stand lost in the infinite series of the sea with nothing ruffled but the waves
the ship rolls the drowsy trade winds blow everything resolves you into
for the most part in this tropic whaling life a sublime invests you you hear no news read no gazettes extras with startling accounts of never you into unnecessary you hear of no domestic afflictions bankrupt securities fall of stocks are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks and your bill of fare is immutable
in one of those southern on a long three or four years voyage as often happens the sum of the various hours you spend at the masthead would amount to several entire months
and it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy or adapted to breed a comfortable of feeling such as pertains to a bed a hammock a hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves
your most usual point of perch is the head of the t where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks almost peculiar to called the t gallant
here tossed about by the sea the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bulls horns
to be sure in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you in the shape of a but properly speaking the thickest is no more of a house than the body for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle and cannot freely move about in it nor even move out of it without running great risk of perishing like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy alps in winter so a is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope or additional skin encasing you
you cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body and no more can you make a convenient closet of your
concerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mastheads of a southern whale ship are with those enviable little tents or pulpits called in which the lookouts of a greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas
in the fireside narrative of captain sleet entitled a voyage among the icebergs in quest of the greenland whale and incidentally for the rediscovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland in this admirable volume all of mastheads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented crowsnest of the glacier which was the name of captain good craft
he called it the crowsnest in honour of himself he being the original inventor and patentee and free from all ridiculous false delicacy and holding that if we call our own children after our own names we fathers being the original inventors and patentees so likewise should we after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget
in shape the crowsnest is something like a large or pipe it is open above however where it is furnished with a movable to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale
being fixed on the summit of the mast you ascend into it through a little in the bottom
on the after side or side next the stern of the ship is a comfortable seat with a locker underneath for umbrellas and coats
in front is a leather rack in which to keep your speaking trumpet pipe telescope and other nautical conveniences
when captain sleet in person stood his masthead in this crowsnest of his he tells us that he always had a rifle with him also fixed in the rack together with a powder flask and shot for the purpose of popping off the stray or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing
now it was plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe as he does all the little detailed conveniences of his crowsnest but though he so enlarges upon many of these and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crowsnest with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the local attraction of all binnacle magnets an error to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ships planks and in the glaciers case perhaps to there having been so many blacksmiths among her crew i say that though the captain is very discreet and scientific here yet for all his learned binnacle deviations azimuth compass observations and approximate errors he knows very well captain sleet that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little so nicely tucked in on one side of his crows nest within easy reach of his hand
though upon the whole i greatly admire and even love the brave the honest and learned captain yet i take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been while with fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that birds nest within three or four perches of the pole
but if we southern are not so snugly housed aloft as captain sleet and his were yet that disadvantage is greatly counterbalanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float
for one i used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top to have a chat with or any one else off duty whom i might find there then ascending a little way further and throwing a lazy leg over the topsail yard take a preliminary view of the watery pastures and so at last mount to my ultimate destination
let me make a clean breast of it here and frankly admit that i kept but sorry guard
with the problem of the universe revolving in me how could left completely to myself at such a could i but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whaleships standing orders keep your weather eye open and sing out every time
and let me in this place movingly admonish you ye shipowners of nantucket
beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye given to and who offers to ship with the instead of bowditch in his head
beware of such an one i say your whales must be seen before they can be killed and this young platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world and never make you one pint of sperm the richer
nor are these at all unneeded
for nowadays the furnishes an asylum for many romantic melancholy and young men disgusted with the cares of earth and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber
childe harold not perches himself upon the masthead of some luckless disappointed and in moody phrase ejaculates roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll
ten thousand sweep over thee in vain
very often do the captains of such ships take those young philosophers to task them with not feeling sufficient interest in the voyage that they are so hopelessly lost to all honourable ambition as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise
but all in vain those young platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect they are shortsighted what use then to strain the visual nerve
they have left their at home
why thou monkey said a to one of these lads weve been cruising now hard upon three years and thou hast not raised a whale yet
whales are scarce as hens teeth whenever thou art up here
perhaps they were or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon but lulled into such an of vacant unconscious reverie is this youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts that at last he loses his identity takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep blue bottomless soul pervading mankind and nature and every strange gliding beautiful thing that eludes him every uprising fin of some form seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it
in this enchanted mood thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came becomes diffused through time and space like cranmer sprinkled pantheistic ashes forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over
there is no life in thee now except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship by her borrowed from the sea by the sea from the inscrutable tides of god
but while this sleep this dream is on ye move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and your identity comes back in horror
over vortices you hover
and perhaps at midday in the fairest weather with one shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea no more to rise for ever
heed it well ye
chapter 36
the quarterdeck
enter ahab then all it was not a great while after the affair of the pipe that one morning shortly after breakfast ahab as was his wont ascended the to the deck
there most usually walk at that hour as country gentlemen after the same meal take a few turns in the garden
soon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he paced his old rounds upon planks so familiar to his tread that they were all over dented like geological stones with the peculiar mark of his walk
did you gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow there also you would see still stranger footprints of his one thought
but on the occasion in question those dents looked deeper even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark
and so full of his thought was ahab that at every uniform turn that he made now at the mainmast and now at the binnacle you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced so completely possessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement
dye mark him flask
whispered stubb the chick thats in him pecks the shell
twill soon be out
the hours wore now shut up within his cabin anon pacing the deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect
it drew near the close of day
suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks and inserting his bone leg into the there and with one hand grasping a shroud he ordered starbuck to send everybody aft
sir
said the mate astonished at an order seldom or never given on shipboard except in some extraordinary case
send everybody aft repeated ahab
mastheads there
come down
when the entire ships company were assembled and with curious and not wholly faces were eyeing him for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up ahab after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks and then darting his eyes among the crew started from his standpoint and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck
with bent head and hat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men till stubb cautiously whispered to flask that ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat
but this did not last long
vehemently pausing he cried what do ye do when ye see a whale men
sing out for him
was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices
good
cried ahab with a wild approval in his tones observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them
and what do ye next men
lower away and after him
and what tune is it ye pull to men
a dead whale or a stove boat
more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving grew the countenance of the old man at every shout while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other as if how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions
but they were all eagerness again as ahab now in his with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightly almost grasping it addressed them thus all ye have before now heard me give orders about a white whale
look ye
dye see this spanish ounce of gold
holding up a broad bright coin to the is a sixteen dollar piece men
dye see it
starbuck hand me yon
while the mate was getting the hammer ahab without speaking was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket as if to heighten its lustre and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him
receiving the from starbuck he advanced towards the mainmast with the hammer uplifted in one hand exhibiting the gold with the other and with a high raised voice exclaiming whosoever of ye raises me a whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw whosoever of ye raises me that whale with three holes punctured in his starboard ye whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale he shall have this gold ounce my boys


cried the seamen as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast
its a white whale i say resumed ahab as he threw down the a white whale
skin your eyes for him men look sharp for white water if ye see but a bubble sing out
all this while tashtego daggoo and had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection
captain ahab said tashtego that white whale must be the same that some call moby dick
moby dick
shouted ahab
do ye know the white whale then tash
does he fantail a little curious sir before he goes down
said the deliberately
and has he a curious spout too said daggoo very bushy even for a and mighty quick captain ahab
and he have one two
good many iron in him hide too captain cried all like faltering hard for a word and screwing his hand round and round as though a corkscrew
cried ahab aye the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him aye daggoo his spout is a big one like a whole shock of wheat and white as a pile of our nantucket wool after the great annual aye tashtego and he fantails like a split jib in a squall
death and devils
men it is moby dick ye have dick
captain ahab said starbuck who with stubb and flask had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder
captain ahab i have heard of moby it was not moby dick that took off thy leg
who told thee that
cried ahab then pausing aye starbuck aye my all round it was moby dick that dismasted me moby dick that brought me to this dead stump i stand on now
aye aye he shouted with a terrific loud animal sob like that of a moose aye aye
it was that accursed white whale that razed me made a poor pegging of me for ever and a day
then tossing both arms with he shouted out aye aye
and ill chase him round good hope and round the horn and round the norway maelstrom and round flames before i give him up
and this is what ye have shipped for men
to chase that white whale on both sides of land and over all sides of earth till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out
what say ye men will ye splice hands on it now
i think ye do look brave
aye aye
shouted the and seamen running closer to the excited old man a sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance for moby dick
god bless ye he seemed to half sob and half shout
god bless ye men
steward
go draw the great measure of grog
but whats this long face about starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whale
