norwood press j s cushing smith co norwood mass usa to my brother herbert macdonald phillpotts a small tribute of great affection the three brothers book i chapter i from great crown of rosy granite the world extended to the and thence by mighty dim passages of earth and sky to the horizons of the sea
a clear may noon illuminated the waste and dartmoor soaking her fill of sunshine ran over with it so that devons self spread little darker of bosom than the grey and silver of high clouds lifted above her mountainous under the sun
hills and plains were still mottled with the winter coat of the heather and the verdure of the spearing grasses suffered diminution under a pallor of dead blades above breaking green but the face of dartmoor began to glow and the spring gorse leapt like a running flame along it
at waters brink was starry silver of crowfoot and the heath still darkling sheltered milkwort and violet and the budding gold of the
one white road ran due northeast and southwest across the desert and round about it like the tents of the rose huge snowy hillocks and ridges in the sun
here the venerable granites of dartmoor that on blush to a ruddy splendour and elsewhere break beautifully in fair colour and fine grain through the coarser porphyritic stone suffer a change and out of their perishing constituents emerges kaolin or china clay
a river met this naked road and at their junction the grey bridge of cadworthy saddled plym
beyond like the back of a brown bear down rolled above the gorges of and further yet retreated fields and forests great uplifted plains and sudden elevations that along their crests with the tender green of distant larch and beech
the atmosphere was opalescent milky sweet as though earths sap leaping to the last and bursting bud exuded upon air the very visible incense and savour of life
running water and lifting lark made the music of this hour and at one spot on the desert a girls voice mingled with them and enlarged the melody for it was gentle and musical and belonged to the springtime
she sat high on where the rushes chatter and where to their eternal treble the wind strikes deep organ music from the forehead of the tor
from the clefts of the rocks around her where foxes homed sometimes and the hawk made her nest there hung now russet tassels and tufts of dead and above this rack of the old year sprang dark green of the new
and also flourished amid the fronds aloft the heath and made curls for the great tors brow below to the girls feet there sloped up boulders that shone with fabric of mosses and dappled lichens and grey
the had climbed hither and its frail bells and sparkling trefoils on the earth
the sun shone with a lustre over the million flattened dead rushes roundabout this place and its light spread out upon them into a pool of pale gold
thus a radiance as of water extended here and the wind fretting all this death heightened the deception while the scattered rocks shone brilliantly against so much reflected light and looked like boulders half submerged at the fringe of a glittering sea
the girl laughed and gazed down at her home
it was a squat grey building halfway between the red tor and the distant bridge
it stood amid bright green crofts and beside it was a and an unseemly patch of rufous light that as a bloodshot the harmonious textures of the waste
there a shippen under an iron roof sank to rusty dissolution
here was farm and a great rabbit warren that extended round about it
milly lived at with an uncle and aunt
she was accustomed to work very hard for her living but for the moment she did not work
she only breathed the breath of spring and talked of love
beside her sat a sturdy youth with a red face and a little budding flaxen moustache
his countenance was not cast in a cheerful mould
indeed he frowned and gazed out of large grey eyes at the valley beneath him
i axed father in plain words if i might be to course that was if you said he answered as plainly that i might not
you see he was terrible up in years afore he got married himself and so he thinks a mans a fool to go into it young
how old was he then
to the day
and hes seventy next month though he dont feel or look anything like so much
hes full of old stale sayings about marrying in haste and repenting at leisure and such like
so there it is milly
the girl nodded
she was a dark maiden with brown eyes and a pretty mouth
she sniffed rather tearfully and wiped her eyes with the corner of her
your father only so long because the right one didnt come
when he found your mother im sure he married her quick enough
no he didnt
they was when he was forty and kept company for five years
that bant loving she said
of course it bant
and yet father isnt what you might call a hard man
far from it to all but me
a kindly creature and a good father if he could only understand more
like a boy in some things
im sure i feel a lot older than him sometimes
if twas ned now hed be friendly and easy as you please
what does mrs ned say
shes on our side and sos my sisters
polly and may think the world of you
as if i was like my brother neda lazy chap that hates the sight of work
i stand to work same as father himself and he knows that and when theres anything calling to be done tis always where be rupert to
but lazy as ned is hed let him marry tomorrow
neds of losing you from cadworthy rupert
the young man looked out where a wood rose south of the bridge and his fathers farm lifted its black chimneys above the trees
he tells me im his right hand and yet refuses though this is the first thing that ever ive asked him he said
wouldnt he suffer it if you promised him to do as he done and not marry for five years
ill promise no such thing
father seems to think tis all moonshine but i shall have another go at him when he comes home next week
till then i shant see you no more for ive promised myself to get through a mighty pile of to astonish him
the harder you work the more hell want you to bide at home she said
not that i mind you working
all the best sort know that
i must credit to me
im like father there
i bant comfortable if i dont get through a good lump of work in the day
she looked at him with large admiration
wheres ned gone to
to bideford for the matches
he always stands stickler when theres a big
such a famous man he was at of devon for nine years
he retired after he was married
but now just on his seventieth birthday hes as clever as any of em
twas his great trouble i do believe that neither me nor ned ever shaped well at it
but we havent got his weight
we take after my mothers people and be light built to father
pity may werent a boy said milly
shes got weight enough
yes he admitted
shes the very daps of father
shell be a when she grows up
tis a nuisance for a woman being made so terrible
but there a happier creature never had to walk slow up a hill
silence fell for a while between them
we must wait and hope she declared at last
i shant change know that
right well i know it and more shant i
youre just turned and im eighteen
after all weve got plenty of time said milly
i hope so
but thats no reason why for we should waste it
tis all wasted till i get you
she put her hand out to him and he caught it and held it
it might be a long sight worse she said
tis only a matter of patience
theres no need for patience and there lies the cruelty
however ill push him hard when he comes home
i will be to in secret but afore the nation
look
she said
two men riding up over
go a bit further off theres a dear
rupert looked where she pointed and then he showed no little astonishment and concern
good lord
he exclaimed
if my uncle humphrey ned and mark along with him
what the mischief sent them here of all ways
cant we hide
but no offered
therefore the young people rose and walked boldly forward
hes going out to hen tor to look at they ruins i reckon said milly
i met your cousin mark a bit ago and he told me his father was rather interested in that old of a place they call hen tor hawk_house
why for i cant say but thats where they be riding i doubt
two men on ponies arrived as she spoke and drew up beside the lovers
the elder exhibited a cast of countenance somewhat remarkable
he was a thin undersized man with grey hair
his narrow face sloped to a pointed chin and his mouth was and very hard
grotesquely large black eyebrows darkened his forehead but they marked no arch
they were set in two patches or tufts and moved freely up and down over a pair of rather dim grey eyes
the appearance of however was not real for humphrey ned possessed good sight
he was years old and a widower
he passed for a harsh secretive man and lived two miles from his elder brother vivian ned of cadworthy
his consisted of himself his son mark and his
good morning uncle humphrey said rupert taking the bull by the horns
you know milly dont you
morning mark
neds black tufts went up and his slit of a mouth elongated
whats this then
he asked
fooling up here with a
i hope youre not taking after your brother
neednt fear that uncle
hows mr
milly
asked the old man abruptly turning to the girl
milly feared even this and mysterious now she turned to him and patted his old ponys neck as she answered very well thank you ned and im sure hed hope you are the same
the tufts came down and he looked closely at her
you playing truant
well why not
tis too fine a day for work perhaps
so it is then
even your old blind pony knows that
only blind the near side he answered
he can see more with one eye than many humans can with both
whats his name please
i dont know
never gave him one
they walked a little way forward while rupert stopped behind and spoke to his cousin mark
so you like that boy very
said the old man and suddenly to milly
she coloured up and nodded
nonsense and
if tis i wouldnt exchange it for your sense mr
ned
he made a deep grunt like a bear
thats the pert way speak to the old folk it
even you was in love once
nonsense and and
would you do different if you could go back
he did not answer the question
i doubt youre too good for rupert ned he said
hes too good for me
he stands to grant that
but hes young and hes foolish like all young things
think better of it
keep away from the young men
your fingers to the bone
thats the only wise way
im going to look at yonder ruin on the side of hen tor
i may build it up again and live there and die there
what
leave mr
ned
why not
tis too much in the world for me and mark
tis the loneliest hawk_house in these parts
too much in the world he repeated
thats nonsense and if you like she said calmly im sure lovemaking be all plain commonsense compared to that
he pulled up and regarded her with a grim stare
ive found somebody today that isnt afraid of me seemingly
why for should i be
for no reason except that most others are
what do they all think
ill tell you they think im wrong here
he tilted up his black hat and tapped his forehead
surely never
the folk only be frightened of your great i believe
rupert always says that you are terrible clever
that shows hes a terrible fool
dont you mate with a fool milly
ill promise that anyway sir
she spoke with perfect and interested the old man
then he found that he was interested and turned upon himself impatiently and shouted to his son
come on boy
what are you there for
mark instantly dug his heels into his pony and followed his father
he was a youthful edition of the elder with a difference
humphrey was and mark was neat
humphreys voice was harsh and disagreeable marks was soft and almost womanly
mark also had a smooth face and heavy eyebrows but his features were clearer cut more delicate his eyes were blue and beautiful
he had a manner somewhat timid and retiring
he was not a man but a native deference guided him in all dealings with his kind
before starting ned stopped drew a letter from his pocket and called to rupert
take this to my brother vivian will you
i was going to leave it on the way back but ill not waste his time
the youth came forward and took the letter
fathers away to stickler for the he said
good god
at his age
cant an old man of seventy find nothing better and wiser to do than run after childish things like that
the son was silent and his uncle with a snort of deep disdain rode forward
tis about the birthday rupert explained to milly
in june father will turn seventy and there is to be a rare fuss made and a spread and all the family to come round him at cadworthy
of course nat will come
in fact twas his idea that we should have a celebration about it but i doubt if uncle humphrey will
hed think such a thing all rubbish no doubt for hes against every sort of merrymaking
you see how he went just now when i told him father was gone to the matches
dont you mind him too much all the same said milly
he looks terrible grim and says dreadful things but i dont believe hes half in earnest
i bant feared of him and never will be
dont you be neither
they left the tor and proceeded to the girls home beneath
the turf of the warrens spread in a green and resilient carpet under their feet and flung in a mighty pattern upon it young red leaves of broke through and spattered the miles of turf with a haze of russet
rupert said farewell at the entrance then he hastened homeward and presently reached his family circle as it was preparing to dine
hester ned the wife of vivian was a quiet fair woman of fine bearing and above middle height
she was twenty years younger than her husband but the union had been a happy and successful one in every respect and the womans mild nature and large patience had chimed well with the mans strong narrow outlook and immovable opinions
kindness of heart and generosity of spirit distinguished them both and these precious traits were handed to the children of the marriage six in number
ned the eldest son was considered the least satisfactory and the best looking
then came rupert a commonplace edition of ned but worth far more as a responsible being
these men resembled their mother and both lived at home
young nathan ned followed
he was a sailor and seldom seen at cadworthy
the two girls of this family succeeded nathan
may and polly were like their dark complexion and inclined to while the baby of the was humphrey a youngster of thirteen called after the dreaded uncle
all save nat the sailor were at table when rupert entered with his letter and all showed keenest interest to learn whether ned of had accepted his invitation
rupert handed the letter to his mother and she was about to put it aside until her husbands return but her children persuaded her to open it
such a terrible exciting thing mother said stout may
us never wont sleep a wink till us knows
i hope to the lord he isnt coming declared ned
twill spoil alla regular deaths head hell be and us shant dare to have an extra drop of beer or a bit of fun after with the girls
beer and a bit of fun with the girls represented the limit of edward neds ambitions and he gratified them with determination when opportunity offered
his father was blind to his faults and set him on a pedestal above the rest of the family but his mother felt concern that her eldest son should be so slight a man
she lived in hope that he might to his responsibilities and justify existence
ned was unusually and would do great things some day in his fathers opinion but the years passed he was now and the only great thing that he had done was twice to become engaged to marry and twice to change his mind
none denied him a rare gift of good looks and his fine figure his curly hair his twinkling eyes and his mouth when it smiled proved attractive to many maidens
mrs ned left a spoon in the large beefsteak pudding and read her letter while a cloud of steam ascended to the kitchen ceiling
dear brother vivian you ask me to come and eat my dinner with you on the day of june next because on that day you will be up home seventy years old
if you think tis a fine thing to find yourself past three score and perhaps it is
you cant go on much longer anyway and journeys end is no hardship
at a first thought i should have reckoned such a birthday wasnt much to rejoice over but youre right and im wrong
a man may pride himself on getting so well through with the bulk of his life and reaching nigh the finish with so few thorns in his feet and aches in his heart as what you have
ill come
yours faithfully humphrey ned
a mournful sound like the wind in the trees went up from uncle humphreys nephews and nieces
be damned to him
said ned
perhaps he wont come after all when he hears nat is coming suggested may
she was always hopeful
mrs ned turned and put the letter on the behind an clock
then she sat down and began to help the pudding
we must make him as welcome as we can for fathers sake she said
chapter ii the hamlet of shaugh a gift to the monks of plympton in time past stands beneath shaugh moor at the edge of a mighty
the church of st edward lifts its battlemented tower and crocketed pinnacles above a world of waste and fallow
it is perched upon a ridge and stands supported by trees and a few cottages in a position of great prominence
the scant beauty that this holy place possessed has vanished under restoration but there yet remain good bells while a notable cast forth by vanished vandals is now returned to its use
round about the church dark sycamores shine in spring and at autumn drop their patched and mottled foliage upon the dust of the dead
fields ascend to the south easterly a high road climbs to the moor and immediately north of shaugh the slopes of high down lead by north wood to cadworthy and cadworthy bridge beyond it
from high down the village and its outlying habitations may be perceived at a glance
the cots and homesteads converge and cluster in with the church as the central point and heart of the organisation
around it dwellers from afar are come to sleep through their eternal night and a double row of slates like an amulet girdles the ancient fane
here and there flash white marble in the string of grey above the graves of the people and beside the churchyard wall stand heaped a pack of times playing thin and broken slates from graves and shattered slabs that have fallen away from the dust they chronicled and now follow into oblivion the bones they marked
a school a rectory the white thorn inn and a dozen dwellings constitute shaugh though the parish extends far beyond these boundaries and on this spring day one thrush warbling from a lilac bush at a cottage door made music loud enough to fill the hamlet
farm stood near on the great hill that fell westerly to shaugh bridge at in the valley and upon the land hard by it two men backward and forward crossing and in the bare centre of a field
they were working over sown mangold and enriching the seed under their feet by scattering upon it a fertile powder
the manure puffed from their hands in little golden clouds under the sunlight
the secret of this mixture belonged to one man and none grew such as he could grow
was the property of nathan ned innkeeper and he had let it for twenty years to a widow but ned took an active personal interest in the welfare of his property and mrs priscilla cora his tenant was very well pleased to follow his advice on all large questions of husbandry and rotation
as did the rest of the world she knew his worth and wisdom
nathan ned had original ideas and these were a source of ceaseless and amicable argument between him and his elder brother vivian ned of cadworthy
but nathans centre of activity and nidus from which his enterprises and undertakings took shape and separate being was the white thorn
here at the centre of the little web of shaugh he pursued his busy and prosperous life
nothing came amiss to him nothing seemed to fail in his hands
he had a finger in fifty pies and men followed his lead as a matter of course for nathan ned was never known to make a bad bargain or faulty investment
nor did he keep his good luck to himself
all men could win his ear the humblest found him kind
he would invest a pound for a day labourer as willingly as ten for a farmer
after years in shaugh he had won the absolute trust of his neighbours
all eyes brightened at his name
he was wont to say that only one living man neither believed in him nor trusted him
and that man as luck will have it is my own brother humphrey the innkeeper would confess over his bar to regular visitors
tis no great odds however and i dont feel it so much as you might think because humphrey ned is built on a very uncomfortable pattern
if twas only me he mistrusted i might feel hurt about it but tis the world and therefore ive got no right to mind
theres he would rely upon in a terrible plight for a man that
but i live in hopes that ill win him round yet
the folk with him and felt a reasonable indignation that this most kindly and transparent of spirits should rest under his own brothers suspicion
they explained it as the work of jealousy
all neds had brains and most were noted for good looks but both gifts had reached their highest development and culmination in nathan
he was the handsomest and the cleverest of the clan and doubtless humphrey a sinister and secret character against whom much was whispered and more suspected envied his brothers gifts and popularity
nathan was sixty the youngest and physically the weakest of the three brothers
he had a delicate throat which often caused him anxiety
the men scattering manure upon the made an end of their work and separated
one took some sacks and the pails used for the fertiliser
then he mounted a horse that stood in a corner of the field and rode away slowly to
his companion crossed the stream beneath the village mounted a hill beyond it and presently entered the white thorn
he was a fair youth in and black leggings
he wore no collar but his blue cotton shirt was clean and made a pleasant contrast of colour with the brown throat that rose from it
young cora was the widow coras only son and her right hand at
the men in the bar gave him good day and ned who was serving drew for him half a pint of beer
well heathman he said
so thats done
and mark me twas worth the doing
if you dont fetch home first prize as usual for they say ive forgot the recipe
tis queer stuff answered the youngster and what with this wind blowing my eyes and nose and throats all full of it
twill do you no harm but rise a pleasant thirst
ned had humour stamped at the wrinkled corners of his bright eyes
his face was genial and
he wore a heavy grey beard but his hair though streaked with grey was still dark in colour
a plastic mouth that widened into laughter a thousand times a day belonged to him
he was rather above average height sturdy and energetic
he declared that he had never known what it was to be weary in mind or body
behind his bar he wore no coat but ministered in shirt sleeves that revealed fine hairy arms
young ned sat in the bar and now he spoke to heathman cora
have one with me heathman he said
i was going down to your mother with a message but now you can take it and save me the trouble
his uncle shook his head
ah the same with you
anybody as will save you trouble be your friend
tis a very poor lookout ned for let a certain party only get wind of it that youre such a chap for running from work and hell mighty soon come along and save you all trouble for evermore
and who might he be nat
old nick my fine fellow
you may laugh but tommy mr_gollop here will bear me out and too wont you
they be both born and bred in the shadow of the church and as well up in morals as and
and theyll tell you that the devils always ready to work for an idle man
true said
true as truth itself
but the wont work for nought any more than the best of us
long hours i grant tired him and never takes a hell have his wages and ned here knows what they be no doubt
ned laughed
im all right he said
i shall work hard enough come presently when it gets to be worth while
spoke again
he was a stout man with a little grey beard a flat forehead barely indicated under his coarse hair and large brown solemn eyes
he and his sister were leading figures at shaugh and took themselves and their manifold labours in a serious spirit
some marked their outlook and their perspective was faulty
they held shaugh as the centre of civilisation and considered that their united labours had served to place and helped to maintain it in that position
thomas was parish clerk and sexton his sister united many avocations
she acted as at the church she was a and midwife she took temporary appointments as plain cook she posed as intelligencer of shaugh and what she did not know of every man woman and child in the village together with their ambitions financial position private relations religious opinions and physical constitutions was not worth knowing
at times of large change like this when we are threatened with all manner of doubts and dangers tis well for every man among us to hold stoutly to religion and defy any one who would shake us said
for my part i shall strike the first blow and let it be seen that im a man very jealous for the lord and the village and the old paths
whats going to happen
asked ned
you talk as if doomsday was coming
not at all answered
when doomsday comes if im still here i shall know how to handle it but tis the new vicar
a man is a man and with a strange man tis only too terrible certain there will creep in strange opinions and a nasty hunger for novelty
and whats worse said mr joe_voysey a young man
an old man i could have faced from my years without fear but how can you expect a young of the fiery silliness of the understand that as ive been gardener at the vicarage for forty year so in right and decency and order i ought to go on being gardener there
have no fear said ned
if theres one thing among us that mr dennis wont change tis you im sure for who knows the outs and ins of the garden up the hill like you do
tis true admitted tommy mr_gollop
that land is like a human you might and stubborn and got to be coaxed to do its best and im sure hell very soon see that only joe_voysey can fetch his beans and peas out of the soil and that its took him a lifetime to learn the trick of the place
and i feel the same to the church
if hes got any fashion of worship shaugh will rise against him like one man
after years of the reverend we cant be blown from our fixed ways at a young mans breath and im sure i do hope that he wont want so much as a cobweb swept down or else therell be difficulties spring up around him like weeds after rain
what a pack of mouldy old fossils you are in this place
said heathman cora
im sure for my part i hope the man will fetch along a few new ideas to us up
if for ned here shaugh would be forgot in the world altogether
you should hear jack on the subject
but tommy mr_gollop little liked such criticism
youre young and terribly ignorant and jacks a red radical as ought to be locked up he answered
but youll do well to keep your ignorance from leaking out and making you look a afore sensible men
a bit ahead of the times rather than behind em and my fear always is and always will be that we shall take the bit in our teeth some day and bolt with it
tis no good being too far ahead of the race and thats why im that this young dennis when he finds how forward we are will try to go one better and stir up strife
dont think it tommy said nathan ned
ive had a good tell with him and find him a very and man
no fool neither
you mustnt expect him to leave everything just as mr left it
you must allow for the difference between and which is mr denniss age but believe me hes calm and sensible and very anxious to please
hes pleased me by praising my beer like one who knew and hes pleased my brother vivian by praising his like one who knew and hell please presently by praising the vicarage garden and hell please you thomas by praising your churchyard
if hes going to be all things to all men hell please none said tommy
weve got no need of one of them easy ministers
him and me must keep the of shaugh same as me and the reverend used to do
however the man will hear my views and my sisters also because a clear understanding from the start be going to save a world of worry after
not married said mr joe_voysey
but a sister
i hope she bant one of they gardening sort socalled thats always messing round making work and finding things down here or eaten with there
if shes a female twill be my place to tell her straight out from the shoulder that flowers wont grow in the vicarage garden and that she must be content with the in summer time and the and homely old stuff
he was a football player to college and very skilled at it so barker told me said ned
then mark me hell be for making a club and teaching the young chaps to play of a saturday and keeping em out of your bar ned declared the parish clerk yes look at it as you will theres changes in the air and i hope well all stand shoulder to shoulder against em and down the man afore he gets his foot in the stirrup
you and enough to frighten the poor soul out of his seven senses afore hes been in the place a week declared ned
and i hope for one that nat wont go against him and i know father wont for hes said this many a day that old was past his work and ought to be pensioned off
your fathers not a man for unseemly changes all the same declared tommy and if this new young minister was to go in the pulpit in white instead of black for instance as the popish habit is vivian ned would be the first to rise up and tell him to dress himself decently and in order
but ned denied this
dont you think you know my father tommy because you dont
if this chap gets up a football club hell have father on his side from the first and he can preach in black or white or so long as he talks sense through his mouth and not nonsense through his nose like the old one did
dont you speak for your father said joseph joe_voysey
he was a very tall and a very thin man with pale watery eyes and a scanty beard
nature had done so much for his long and rather absurd hatchet nose that there was no material left for his chin
if i shouldnt talk for my father who should
retorted ned
then mr joe_voysey descended to personalities and accused the other of irreverence and laziness
the argument grew sharp and ned was forced to still it
come you along and dont talk twaddle ned he said to his nephew
im going down to myself this minute to see mrs cora and you and heathman will come with me
he called to a turned down his sleeves took his coat from a hook behind the door and was ready to start
when mr dennis does come among us twill be everybodys joy and pride to make him welcome in a kindly spirit he said
changes must happen but if hes a gentleman and a sportsman and a of which he certainly looks to twill be the fault of shaugh and not the mans if all dont go friendly and
give and takes the motto
yes admitted
give nought and take all thats the way of the young nowadays and thatll be his way so like as not and ill deny him to his face from the first minute if he seeks to ride roughshod over me and the church and the people
hear
hear
cried mr joe_voysey
well hope hell have enough sense to spare a little for you silly old said heathman cora
then he followed the neds
chapter iii nathan ned like his brother humphrey was a widower
very early in life he had married a young woman of good means and social position superior to his own
his handsome face and manifold charms of disposition won minnie and she brought to him a small fortune in her own right together with the detestation of her whole family
husband and wife had lived happily save for the womans fierce and undying jealousy which extended beyond her early grave
she died childless at and left five thousand pounds to her husband on the understanding that he did not marry again
he obeyed this condition though it was vain in law and presently returned to his own people
his married life was spent at taunton as a general dealer but upon his wifes death he abandoned this business and set up another like it at bath
at years of age he came back to devonshire and his native village
great natural energy kept him busy
he dearly liked to conduct all manner of business and his good nature was such that the folk did not hesitate to consult him upon their affairs
his legal attainments were considered profound while his shrewd handling of figures and his personal prosperity combined to place him on a pinnacle among the folk as a great financier and most capable man of business
he did not lend money at interest but was known more than once to have helped a lame dog over a stile
many kind things he did and no man spoke a bad word of him
people brought him their savings and begged him to invest them according to his judgment
they usually asked for no details but received their interest regularly and trusted nathan ned like the bank of england
he was in truth a and kindly spirit who found his pleasure in the affection and also in the applause of the people
he liked to figure among them as the first
he loved work for itself and enjoyed the universal praise of his attainments
might himself into believing that he was the leading citizen of shaugh but the master of the white thorn knew better
without undue vanity he was not able to hide the fact that he stood above others in the esteem of the countryside
he was not so rich as people thought and he had not laid foundations of such a fortune as they supposed during the years at bath but he fostered the impression and the fame it gave him
it suited better his native idiosyncrasy to tower among smaller men than to be small amidst his betters
he liked the reverence of and the of the school children
the late vicar a tory of the early victorian age had contrived to let ned perceive the gulf that existed between them and that the more definitely because nathan was a nonconformist
the publican professed strong conservative principles however and the attitude of the last incumbent of shaugh had caused him some secret annoyance but he too hoped that with the advent of a younger man and modern principles this slight disability might vanish
for the rest he rode to hounds and his attitude in the hunting field was admitted to be exceedingly correct and tactful
he had no known confidant and he seldom spoke about himself
that he had never married astonished many people exceedingly but it was significant of the genuine affection and esteem entertained for him that none even when they came to learn of his dead wifes bequest and its condition ever imputed sordid motives to his celibacy
five thousand pounds was guessed to be but a small part of neds fortune and when the matter chanced upon local tongues men and women alike were quite content to believe that not affection for money but love for his dead partner had proved strong enough to maintain nathan in widowhood
he liked the company of women and was never so pleased as when doing them a service
for their part they admired him also and wished him well
ned not only owned the white thorn and its but had other hawk_house property at shaugh and in the neighbouring parish of
his principal possession was the large farm of and thither now he proceeded with his nephew ned on one side of him and young heathman cora on the other
according to his wont nathan and suited the conversation to his listeners
you young chaps must both join the football club if there is one
im glad to think new parsons that sort for tis just the kind of thing were wanting here
you fellows and a lot like you spend too much time and money at my bar to please me
you may laugh ned but tis so
and another thing id have you to know so like as not we shall have a rifle corps also
ive often turned my mind on it
we must let this man see were not all willingly behind the times but only waiting for a bit of encouragement to go ahead with the best
ned pictured his own fine figure in a uniform and applauded the rifle corps and heathman did the like
ned here would fancy himself a lot in that black and silver the yeomanry wear wouldnt you ned
tis a very good idea and would help to make you and a few other chaps as straight in the shoulders as me declared ned
well you may be straight answered the other with a laugh
certainly youve never been known yet to bend your shoulders to work
a days be the hardest job that ever youve taken courting the maidens be a hard job
ned laughed and so did his uncle
youre right there heathman declared ned
a lazy scamp you are ned though your father wont see it but nobody knows it better than the girls
they like you very well for a fine day and a picnic by the river but i can tell you this theyre getting to see through you only too well
they dont want fairweather husbands but stout hard fellows like heathman here as have got brains and use em and arms and legs and use em
no more than a pink and white china stuck on a said heathman
whereupon ned dashed at him and half in jest half in earnest they wrestled by the roadside
ned looked on with great enjoyment and helped presently to dust heathman after he had been
thatll show e if im a pink and white puppet for a mantelpiece declared ned
the other laughed and licked a scratch on his hand
well done you
he said
never thought you was so spry
but lets have a whole days ploughing over a bit of the field to and see what sort of a man you are in the evening
not me answered the other
got no use for the myself
rupert will take you on at that
to see you wrestle puts me in mind of your father said nathan
this generation cant call home his greatness and beside him youre a shrimp to a lobster ned but twas a grand sight to see him handle a man in his prime
i mind actually getting him up to london once because i named his name there among some sporting fellows and twas slighted
they thought being my brother that i held him too high though he was champion of devon at the time
but my way is never to say nought with my tongue that i wont back with my pocket and i made a match for thirty pounds a side for your father
a middlesex man called thorpe from down bermondsey way was chosen and your father came up on a friday and put that chap on his back twice in five minutes and then went home again fifteen pound to the good
a very clever man too was thorpe but he never wanted to have no more to do with your father
vivian weighed over fourteen stone in them days and not a pound of fat in the lot i believe
he could have down a tor i reckon if he could have got a hold on it
but you fellows be after your mothers build
the best of thats at never draw the beam to twelve stone
a tramp stopped ned touched his hat and spoke
you gave me a bit of work harvesting two year ago master and you didnt pull much of a long face when i told you i wasnt fond of work as a rule
im more broke than usual just for the minute and rather short o
can e give me a job
nathan was famous at making work for everybody and loafers rarely appealed to him in vain
how such an exceedingly busy man could find it in his heart to sympathise with drones none knew
it was another of the anomalies of neds character
but he often proved good for a square meal a days labour and a nights rest as many folk well knew
youre the joker who calls himself the duke of drakes island arent you
the duke of drakes island and nodded
he was a worthless soul very well known to the devon constabulary
get up to the village and call at the white thorn in an hour from now and ask for me
thank you kindly mr
ned
well see about that later
i can find a job for you tonight but it aint picking primroses
priscilla cora met her landlord at the gate of
they were on terms of intimacy and nodded to each other in an easy and friendly manner
she had been feeding poultry from a basin and now set it down wiped her fingers on her apron and shook hands with ned
how be you then
tis a time since you called on us master ned
im clever thank you and i see you are mrs cora
and i hope cora and phyllis be all right too
heathman here be growing as strong as a you heathman
mrs cora was a brown woman of rather more than fifty
for twenty years she had farmed and her power of reserve surprised a garrulous village
it was taken by the sensible for wisdom and by the foolish for pride
she worked hard paid her rent at the hour it was due as nathan often mentioned to her credit and kept her own counsel
very little was known about her save that she had come to shaugh as a widow with three young children that she was kindhearted and might have married a year after her arrival but had declined the honour
her daughters were at dinner when the men entered and both rose and saluted ned with some
phyllis the younger was like her mother brown neat silent and reserved the elder was cast in a larger mould and might have been called frankly beautiful
cora was dark with black eyes and a fair skin whose purity she took pains to preserve
she was tall straight and full in the bosom
her mouth alone betrayed her for the lips set close and they were rather thin but people forgot them when she laughed and showed her pretty teeth
her laugh again belied her lips for it was gentle and pleasant
she had few delusions for a maiden and she worked hard
to cora belonged a gift of commonsense
the girl lacked sentiment but she was shrewd and capable
she kept her mothers books and displayed a talent for figures
it was said that she had the brains of the family
only ned himself doubted it and maintained that coras mother was the woman
phyllis was lost at all times in admiration of her more brilliant sister but heathman did not like cora and often quarrelled with her
ned gave his message and asked for a drink of cider
thereupon phyllis rose from her dinner and went to fetch it
but young neds eyes were on cora while he drank
he had the manner of a man very well accustomed to female society and long experience had taught him that nine girls out of ten found him exceedingly attractive
his easy insolence won them against their will
such girls as demanded worship and respect found ned not so agreeable but those who preferred the male creature to dominate were fascinated by his sublimity and affectation of knowledge and worldly wisdom
he pretended to know convincing attitude only among those who know nothing
the talk was of a revel presently to take place at tavistock
and whats your gown going to be phyllis
asked ned
the gown of phyllis did not interest him in the least but this question was put as a preliminary to another and when the younger sister told him that she meant to wear he turned to cora
coras got a lovely muslin wi little pink roses and a straw hat wi big pink roses said phyllis
ned nodded
id go a long way to see her in such a beautiful dress he said and mind im to have a dance or two with you both
theres to be dancing in the rough and tumble on the grass but boards are to be laid down and everything done proper
they about the promised festivity while nathan and mrs cora having discussed certain farm matters spoke of another and a nearer celebration
you see my brother vivian and i are of the good sort and were bent on the whole family meeting at a square feed with good wishes all round on his seventieth birthday
to think of him turned seventy
i cant believe it
yet time wont stand even with the busiest
a family affair tis to be and none asked outside ourselves
does mr humphrey go
hes not much of a hand at a revel
he is not and i thought that he would have refused the invitation
but hes accepted
we shall try our hardest to cheer him up and get a drop of generous liquor into him
i only hope he wont be a damper and spoil the fun
a pity hes going
we shall know that better afterwards
twill be a pity if he mars all but twill be a good thing if we him amongst us and get him to take a view of life and a kinder view of his
ned chimed in
youll never do that nat
hes too old to change now
and cousin mark be going just the same way
hes getting such a silent chap and no wonder having to live with such a father
id run away if i was him
nathan laughed
i believe youd almost rather work than keep along with your uncle humphrey he said
tis pretty well known i can work when i choose declared ned
yes said heathman with his mouth full and tis also pretty well known you never do choose
the elder ned clapped his hands
one to you heathman
he said
ned cant deny the truth of that
but ned showed no concern
i shall make up for lost time very easily when i do start he said
ive got ideas i believe and they go beyond ploughing
im like cora brains
you may laugh nat but youre not the only ned with a head on your shoulders
ill astonish you yet
you day you begin to work ned and the sooner the better
i shall be very glad when it happens
the women laughed and cora much admired neds lofty attitude
she too had ambitions and felt little sympathy with those who were content to labour on the soil
she strove often to fire her brother and enlarge his ambitions but he had the farmers instinct enjoyed physical work and laughed at her airs and graces
give me rupert said heathman now
hes like much good at talking and aint got no use for the girls but a to work
the man who aint got no use for the girls is not a man declared ned very positively
theyre the salt of the they mrs
cora
she smiled and looked at him curiously then at his uncle but she did not answer
anyway continued ned youre out when you say ruperts like you for hard worker that he is hes found time for a bit of lovemaking
cora and phyllis manifested instant excitement and interest at this news
who is she
you must tell us said the elder
why i will but say nought for nothing be known about it outside the families and rupert havent said a word himself to me
i reckon he dont guess that i know
but such things cant be hid from my sharp for that i believe
tis milly if you must know
a very nice little thing too in her way
not my sorta bit too independent
i like a girl to feel a mans the oak to her ivy but uproarious laughter from his uncle cut ned short
mighty fine oak for a girls
he said
you wait repeated the younger
anyway rupert be sweet on milly and father knows all about it and wont hear of it
so theres thunder in the air for the moment
they discussed this interesting private news but promised ned not to retail it in any ear
then he left them and with nathan returned to the village
ned undeterred by neds began loudly to praise cora as soon as they had passed beyond earshot of the
by jove shes a maiden and no mistake
not her like this side of plymouth i do believe
havent seen her for a month of sundays and shes come on amazing
shes a very handsome girl without a doubt admitted nathan
and a very clever girl too but a word in your ear my young shaver you mustnt look that way once and for all
why not if i choose
im a free man
you may shame to you
but your cousin mark be first in the field there
a word to the wise is enough
youll be doing a very improper thing if you look in that quarter and i must firmly beg you wont for everybodys sake
mark
mark
and a very good chap he fifty of you
mark
repeated ned as though the notion was unthinkable
i should have guessed that he would rather have run out of the country than lift his eyes to a girl
chapter iv the reverend dennis dennis was a bachelor
he came to shaugh full of physical energy and certain hazy resolutions to accomplish notable work among a neglected people
his scholastic career was and his intellect had offered no bar to his profession
he was physically brave morally infirm
therefore his sister alice dennis came to support him and share his lot and complement his character
she might indeed fly from cows but she would not fly from parochial opposition
she was strong where he was weak
they were young sanguine and of gentle birth
they enjoyed private means but were filled with wholesome ardour to justify existence and leave the world better than they found it
dennis dennis possessed interest and regarded this his first cure as a to better things
shaugh was too small for his natural energies and powers of he told his sister but she said that the experience would be helpful
she also suspected that reform might not be a matter of energy alone
one evening a week after their arrival they were planning the campaign and estimating the value of lay helpers when two important visitors were announced
a maiden appeared and informed the clergyman that thomas and mr_gollop mr_gollop desired to see him
show them into the common room said he then he twisted a little bronze cross that he wore at his and regarded miss dennis
the parish clerk and his wonder if youd mind alice
he asked
for answer she put down her work
certainly
since you saw alone and not only engaged him but promised he might have a boy for the weeding i you are a great deal too easy dennis
mr_gollop is a very masterful person clearly and his sister so i am told is just the same
you certainly must not see women alone
theyll get everything they want out of you
of course one wishes to strike a genial note he explained
first impressions count for such a lot with common people
be genial by all means i say nothing against that
lets tackle them then
a tremendous conservative but we must get liberal ideas into him if we canin reason
dennis dennis was tall and
he regarded himself as somewhat advanced but had no intention of sowing his opinions upon the parish before the soil was prepared
he considered his character to be tolerant and sane and for a man of he enjoyed fair measure of these virtues
his sister was plain angular and four years older than dennis
she wore double eyeglasses and had a gruff voice and a perceptible beard
the rose as the vicar and his sister appeared
mr_gollop was shorter and stouter than her brother but resembled him
good evening your reverence good evening miss said the parish clerk
this is my sister mr_gollop
for faith hope and charity she
in fact a leading light among us though i say it as should not
mr dennis shook hands with the woman his sister bowed only
and what does mr_gollop do
asked dennis
be easier to say what she dont do answered thomas
shes to begin with or as you would call it
then shes to the parish and shes midwife and when free shell do chores or cook for them as want her
and shes got a knowledge and understanding of the people round these parts as wont be beaten
she was mr right hand wasnt you mr_gollop
so he said answered mr_gollop
she was not but bore herself as fames familiar and one accustomed to admiration
she had estimated the force of the clergymans character from his first sermon and judged that her brother would be a match for him
now she covertly regarded miss dennis and perceived that here must lie any issue of battle that might arise
do you abide along with your brother miss or be you just settling him into the vicarage
she asked
i live with him
mr_gollop inclined her head
and im sure i hope if i can serve you any way at any time as youll let me know
thank you
everybody can serve us we want help from one and all said mr dennis
so
said thomas
and you must each mans value from those that know by bitter experience
likewise with the women
my sister can tell you to threepence a day what any female in this parish be good for and as to the men youll do very well to come to me
i know em and their characters and their and bad crooked and odd
for weve got some originals among us and im not going to deny it havent us mr_gollop
every place have she said
might we sit down
asked the man
wem of the breed as you see and not so clever in our breathing as we could wish
but wem here to go through the whole law and the prophets so to speak and we can do it better sitting
please sit down answered dennis
then he looked at his watch
i can give you an hour he said
but im going to ride over to at nine oclock to see the vicar there
and a very nice gentleman youll find him declared thomas
of course be but a little matter beside shaugh
we bulk a good deal larger in the eyes of the nation and can hold our heads so much the higher in consequence but the reverend coaker is a very good man and knows his place in a way thats a high example to the younger clergymen
miss dennis cleared her throat but her voice was none the less gruff
perhaps you will now tell us what you have come for
we are busy people she said
her brother deprecated this brevity and tried to tone it down but thomas accepted the ladys statement with great urbanity
miss be right he answered
busy as bees i as me and my own sister here
she dont wear out many chairs do you mr_gollop
not many said mr_gollop
i always say lets run about in this world plenty of time to sit down in the next
i may tell you added thomas kindly that your first sermon went down very
from where i sits along by the font i can get a good look across the faces and the important people the neds and the and the and the and all listened to every word and nodded now and again
youll be glad to know that
some thought twas a sermon theyd heard afore however said mr_gollop but no doubt they was wrong
quite wrong declared dennis warmly
it was a sermon written only the night before i preached it
and talking of the font yes of course youve marked the famous over the holy basin i suppose
interrupted
tis the joy and pride of the churchtown i assure you
not another like it in the world they say
learned men come all across england to see itas well they may
the famous with its eight little saints and the abbot elevated in the midst was a special glory of st edwards
i meant to speak of that said the clergyman
the figure at the top has got more than his proper vestments on mr_gollop
in fact hes wrapped up in cobwebs
that is not worthy of us
please see they are cleaned off
i hadnt noticed them but since you say look to it myself
where the be concerned i allow none to meddle
it shall be done but i must say again that i havent noticed any last sunday
have you mr_gollop
said thomas
no i have not answered his sister
the dirt has clearly been there for months remarked miss dennis
there was a painful pause during which mr_gollop gazed at the vicars sister and then at the vicar
tis a fact that spiders will spin she said vaguely but not without intention
the other woman ignored her and turned to thomas
will you be so good as to proceed
yes and gladly miss he answered
and ill begin with the since theyve done as much for this parish as anybody living or dead
my father was parish clerk afore me and a very remarkable man wasnt he mr_gollop
he was
a remarkable man with a large faith in the power of prayer was father
you dont see such faith now worse luck
but he believed more than even i hold to or my sister either
you might say that he wasnt right always but none ever dared to doubt the high religious quality of the man
but there he wasa pillar of the church and state as they say
he used to help his money a bit by the power of prayer and they fetched sick of the thrush to him and hed tak em up the church tower and hold em over the battlements north south east and he said the lords prayer four times
hed get a shilling by it every time and was known to do twenty of em in a good year though i never heard twas a very quick cure
but faith moves mountains and he may have done more good than appeared to human eyes
and then in his age he very near let a heavy drop over into the grabbed hold of un by a miracle and saved un
so that proper terrified the old man and he never done another for fear of some lasting misfortune
not but what a few people said that if twas he let the fall now and again hed brisk up his business a hundred per centum
which shows the of human nature
ill have no gross superstition of that sort here said mr dennis firmly
no more wont i answered thomas
other times other manners as the saying is
have no fear
the church is very safe with me and mr_gollop for watchdogs
well so much for my father
there was only us two and we never busy for that
and weve done no little for shaugh as will be better told you in good time by other mouths than ours
he stopped to take breath and miss dennis spoke
my brother will tell you that with regard to parish clerks the times are altering too she said
and dont i know it
he answered
why good powers you cant get a clerk for love or money nowadays
regular dying out
hell be thankful got one of the good old sort i said to my sister
for hed have had to look beyond for such another as me
and so he would
thats true declared mr_gollop
i mean that the congregation takes the place of the clerk in most modern services continued miss dennis
in point of fact we shall not want exactly what you understand by a clerk
other times other manners as you very wisely remarked just now
stared
not want a clerk
he said
woman alive you must be daft
i believe not answered miss dennis
however what my brother has got to say regarding his intentions can come later
for the present he will hear you
if you dont want a clerk ive done answered
but ill make bold to think you cant mean that
leave it and ill tell my tale about the people
the be a harmless folk and humble and fertile as
youll have no trouble along with them
the neds be valuable and powerful and mr humphrey and his son is church and vivian and his family is church also and his darters sing in the choir
we shall manage without women in the choir said miss dennis
you may think so but i doubt it answered mr_gollop mr_gollop almost fiercely
youll have to manage without anybody in the church also if you be for the whole order of divine service
she was excited and her large bosom heaved
not declared the clergyman
call it reorganisation
frankly i propose a choir
i have the bishops permission he wishes it
now go on
then the lord help you said thomas
wed better be going mr_gollop
weve heard almost enough for one evening
be reasonable urged miss dennis with admirable
we are here to do our duty
we hope and expect to be helped by all sensible hindered
let tell us what he came to tell us
to ask no more but where is it
murmured thomas
twas the neds he continued wiping his forehead
the other of unfortunately a chapel member and if you be going to play these here may games in the hawk_house of the lord im very much hell draw a good few after him
they wont stand me
where do the people at worship
i did not see mrs cora and her family last sunday
all chapel too
mr dennis nodded
thank you for these various facts
is there anything more
ive only just begun
but i with warnings chiefly
there be six radicals in this parish and only six
though the lord knows how many there will be when they hear about the choir said mr_gollop mr_gollop
im an liberal myself declared the vicar
but i hope your radicals are sound churchmen whatever else they may be
humphrey ned sos his son
is that young mark ned
bell among the ringers
a very man
hes a wonderful ringer and wrapped up in tenor bell as if twas a heathen idol
in fact hem not the good christian he might be and hell ring than hell pray
then saul_luscombe milly to and a very hard nut and sos his man jack
you wont get either of them inside the church
they say in their wicked way they aint got no need for sleeping after breakfast of a in fact
the other labouring man from is a good christian however
he can read but tis doubtful whether he can write
youll have to go to keep your appointment dennis remarked his sister
plenty of time
is there anything more thats particularly important mr_gollop
lots more
still if im to be shouted down every minute i to encourage and fortify you
i to tell you to have no fear because me and sister was on your side and always ready to fight to the death for righteousness
but youve took the wind out of our sails in a manner of speaking
if you bant going to walk in the old paths im terrible afraid youll find us against you
this is said miss dennis
not at all answered the clerks sister
its sense
tis a free country and if going to set a lot of sensible people by the ears the sin be on your shoulders
youd best to come home thomas
mr dennis looked helplessly at his watch
we shall soon arrive modus vivendi he said
i dont know what that may be your reverence she answered but if tis an empty church and sour looks and trouble behind every hedge then you certainly will arrive at even sooner than you think for
hes going to give ear to the too clear thomas as he rose and picked up his hat
i can only trust that you two good people do not represent the parish continued the vicar
youll terrible soon find as we do said mr_gollop
so much the worse
however it is well that we understand one another
next sunday i shall invite my leading parishioners to meet me in the schoolroom on the following evening
i shall then state my intentions and listen to the opinions and objections of every man among you
and only the men will be invited to the meeting added miss dennis
tis a parlous the parish clerk
i meant well
you can bear me out mr_gollop that i meant man meant better
good evening said miss dennis and left them
be sure that we shall soon settle down prophesied the vicar
i know you mean well mr_gollop and i mean well too
where sensible people are concerned friction is reduced to a minimum
we shall very soon understand one another and respect one anothers opinions
if you respect peoples opinions you abide by em declared mr_gollop
us shant be able to keep the cart on the with a choir foretold her brother
then dennis saw them to the door they took their leave and as they went down the vicarage drive their voices together like two slow beetles droning on the night
chapter v both the yeoman and gentle families of devon have undergone a wide and deep disintegration during the recent past
many are swept away and the downfall dates back beyond the eighteenth century when war dice and the bottle laid foundations of subsequent ruin but the descendants of many an ancient stock are still with us and noble names shall be found at the historical patronymics on the land
the race of ned had borne arms and stood for the king in stuart times
the family was broken in the parliamentary wars and languished for certain centuries then it took heart and lifted head once more
the three brothers who now carried on their line were doubly enriched for their father had died in good case and left a little fortune behind him while an uncle blessed with some tincture of the gipsy blood that had flowed into the native stock a hundred years before found devon too small a theatre for his activities and migrated to australia
he died a bachelor and left his money to his nephews
thus the trio began life under fortunate circumstances and it appeared that two had prospered and justified existence while concerning the other little could be affirmed save a latent and general dislike founded on vague hearsay
they were different as men well could be yet each displayed strong individuality and an assertive temperament
all inherited some ancestral strength but disparities existed between their tastes their judgments and their ambitions
vivian ned was generous and kindhearted
he loved before all things work yet in direct opposition to this ruling passion tolerated and spoiled a lazy eldest son
from the rest of his family he exacted full measure of labour and very perfect obedience
he was a man of crystallised who resented change and built on blind tradition
nathan ned had a volatile and spirit
he was sympathetic but not so sympathetic as his manner made him appear
he had a histrionic knack to seem more than he felt yet this was not all acting but a mixture of art and instinct
he trusted to tact to a sense of humour with its accompanying tolerance and to swift appraisal of human character
adaptability was his watchword
humphrey ned personified doubt
his apparent chill indifference crushed the young and irritated the old
an outward of manner and a pessimistic attitude to affairs sufficed to turn the folk from him
while he seemed the spirit of negation made alive he was nevertheless a steadfast christian and his dark mind chaotic though it continued to be even into age enjoyed one precious attribute of chaos and continued plastic and open to impressions
none understood this quality in him
he did not wholly understand it himself
but he was ever seeking for content and the search had thus far taken him into many fruitless places and landed him in blind alleys not a few
these adventures following his wifes death had served to sour him in some directions and the late ripening of a but keen intelligence did not as yet appear to his neighbours
it remained to be seen whether time would ever achieve a larger wisdom patience and understanding in considerable mental endowments would ultimately lift him nearer peace and content or plunge him deeper into and incorrigible gloom
he was as interesting as nathan was attractive and vivian obvious
the attitude of the brothers each to the other may be recorded in a sentence
vivian immensely admired the innkeeper and depended no little upon his judgment in temporal affairs but humphrey he did not understand nathan patronised his eldest brother and resented humphreys dislike while the master of held vivian in regard as an honest and man but did not share the worlds esteem for nathan
they always preserved reciprocal amenities and were accounted on friendly terms
upon the occasion of the eldest brothers seventieth birthday both vivian and nathan stood at the outer gate of cadworthy and welcomed humphrey when he alighted off his pony
years sat lightly on the farmer
he was a man of huge girth and height above the average
he had a red moon face with a great fleshy jowl set in white whiskers
his brow was broad and low his small eyes with
it was a favourite jest with him that he weighed within a stone or two as much as his brothers put together
they shook hands and went in while mark and rupert took the ponies
the three brothers all wore sunday black and vivian had a yellow tie on that made disharmony with the crimson of his great cheeks
this mountain of a man walked between the others and nathan came to his ear and humphrey did not reach his shoulder
the last looked a mere shadow beside his brother
seventy year today and have moved two ton of hundredweight to the and noon
and never felt better than this minute he told them
tis folly all the heavy work that you delight in declared nathan
im sure humphreys of my mind
you to do such a lot of young mans work
tis foolish and quite uncalled for
the young men cant do it maybe said humphrey
vivian be three men rolled into the strength of three for all his and ten years
but youre in the right
hes too old for these deeds
theres no call for weightlifting and all this sweating labour though he is such a mighty man of his hands still
ned of cadworthy laughed
you be such brainy pair of you havent got no patience with me and my schoolboy fun
but then i never had no intellects like ran into muscle and bone
and tis my pleasure to show the young generation what strength be
the reverend dennis preached from a very text sunday there were giants in those days it some such words if my memory serves me
and rupert and may as were along with me said as surely i belonged to the giant race
he laughed with a loud simple explosion of ingenuous merriment and led the way to the parlour
there his wife in black silk welcomed her and received their congratulations
humphrey fumbled at a parcel which he produced from his breast
he untied the string wound it up and put it into his pocket
tis a book as i heard well spoken of he said
theres only one book for you and me i believe vivian but an old man as i know came by this and he said twas light in his darkness so i went and bought a copy for you by way of something to mark the day
very like tis all rubbish and if so you can throw it behind the fire
sermons and good ones without a doubt answered the farmer
im very fond of sermons and ill lay on to em without delay and let you know what i think
not that my opinion of such a thing do count but i can tell to a hair if within the meaning of scripture and that be all that matters
and thank you kindly im sure
tom got terrible about mr dennis said nathan
he says that your parson is a radical and will bring down dreadful things on the parish
old fool answered humphrey
tis just what we want within the meaning of reason to have a few of the cobwebs swept away
but youre a radical too and all for sweeping away argued his eldest brother doubtfully
im for folly and nonsense being swept away certainly
im for all this cant about humility and our duty to our superiors being swept away
i hate to see chaps pulling their hair to other men no better than themselves and all that servile rubbish
nathan felt this to be a challenge
we take off our hats to the blood in a mans veins if tis blue to the man
and hate the man all the time so act a lie when we cap to him and pretend what isnt true
you go too far declared nathan
i say that we hate anything thats stronger than we are continued his brother
we hate brains thats stronger than our own or pockets thats deeper
the only folk that we smile upon honestly be those we reckon greater fools than ourselves
vivian laughed loud at this
what a sharp tongue the man hath
he exclaimed
but hes wrong for all that
for if i only smiled at them who had less brains than myself i should go glum from morn till night
dont say it father
cried his wife
too you be and always will be
tis only a very wise man that knows himself for a fool all the same declared nathan
as for humphrey here maybe tis because men hate brains bigger than their own as he says that he hasnt got a larger circle of friends himself
we all know hes the cleverest man among us
humphrey was about to speak again but restrained the inclination and turned to his nieces who now appeared
polly lacked character and existed as the right hand of her mother but may took physically after vivian and represented his first joy and the apple of his eye
she was a girl of great breadth and bulk every way
the beauty of youth still belonged to her clean white and red face and her yellow hair was magnificent but it required no prophet to foretell that poor may when her present life of physical activity decreased must swiftly grow too vast for her own comfort or the temptation of the average lover
the youngest of the uncle humphreys his sisters
he was a brown boy well set up and shy
of all men he feared the elder humphrey most
now he shook hands
dont stare at the ceiling and the floor but look me in the eyes
i hate a chap as glances his nose like that said the master of
the lesser humphrey and flushed
then he braced himself for the ordeal and stared steadily into his uncles eyes
the duel lasted full two minutes and the boys father laughed and applauded him
at last young humphreys eyes fell
thats better said humphrey the elder
you learn to keep your gaze on the eyes of other people my lad if you want to know the truth about em
a voice will teach you a lot but the eyes are the book for nathan
no doubt theres a deal in that
and if twas followed perhaps we shouldnt take our hats off to certain people quite so often as we do added humphrey harking back to the old grievance
whats the good of being respectful to those you dont respect and ought not to respect
the mans hungry
said vivian
tis starvation making him so crusty and so clever
come now bant dinner ready
mrs ned had departed and polly with her
hurry em up cried vivian and his youngest son hastened to do so
meantime nathan who was also hungry and who also desired to display agility of mind before his elder brother resumed the argument with humphrey and answered his last question
because weve everything to gain by being civil and nought to gain by being otherwise as things are nowadays
civility costs nothing and the rich expect it of the poor and gentle expect it of simple
why not
you cant mar them by being rude but you can mar yourself
the golden rule for a pushing man is to be well thought upon
thats what our father used to say
and its sound sense if you ask me
of course im not speaking for us but for the younger generation and if they can prosper by tact and civility to their betters why not
we like the younger and humbler people to be civil to us then why shouldnt they be civil to parson and squire
how if parson be no good and squire a drinker or a rascal
thats neither here nor there
tis their calling and rank and the weight behind em
trash
said humphrey
let every man be weighed in his own balance and show himself what he is
thats what i demand
why should we pretend and give people the credit of what they stand for if they dont stand for it
for a lot of reasons began nathan then the boy humphrey returned to say that dinner was ready
they sat down and through the steam that rose from a dish of ducks humphrey looked at nathan and spoke
what reasons
he said
for your credits sake you cant leave it there
if you will have it you will have this isnt the time or place but vivian must blame you not me
lifes largely a game of and pretence and right or wrong weve got to suffer it
we should all be no better than lonely monkeys or red indians if we didnt pretend a bit more than we meant and say a bit more than wed swear to
monkeys dont pretend and whats the result
theyve all gone under
they until the food was on the plates then vivian who had been puffing out his cheeks rolling his eyes and showing uneasiness in other ways displayed a sudden irritability
god damn it
he cried
lets have no more of this
be the meal to be with no sauce but all this blasted nonsense
get the drink rupert
nathan expressed instant regret and strove to lift the tone of the company
but the cloud did not pass so easily
vivian himself soon forgot the incident his children and his wife found it difficult
the young people indeed maintained a very dogged and only talked among themselves in subdued tones
may and polly upon the rest between the intervals of their own meal
they changed the dishes and went to and from the kitchen
rupert and his youngest brother helped them but ned did not
some cheerfulness returned with the beer and even humphrey ned strove to assist the general but he lacked the power
his mind was of the sort that cannot suffer opinions believed erroneous to pass unchallenged
sometimes he expressed no more than doubt sometimes he dissented forcibly to nathans generalities
but after vivians heat at the beginning of the entertainment his brother from the white thorn was cautious and took care to raise no more dust of controversy
the talk ran on the new vicar and the master of cadworthy spoke well of him
an understanding man and for my part though i cant pretend to like new things yet i bant going to quarrel for nothing
and if he likes to put the boys in and make the maidens sit with the congregation i dont see no great harm
they can sing praises to god wi their noses to the east just so easy as they can facing north
well said declared humphrey
ive no patience with such fools as mr_gollop
as one outside and after a different persuasion i can look on impartial declared nathan
and i think with you both that dennis is a useful and promising man
as for mr_gollop hes the sort that cant see further than the end of the parish and dont want to do so
for why
hed tell you theres nought beyond said humphrey
he foxes himself to think that the world can go on without change
he fancies that he alone of us all be a solid stuck up to watch the waves roll by
tis a sign of a terrible weak intellect to think that everybodys changeable but ourselves and that we only be the ones that know no shadow of changing
yet ive seen many such a cheerful conceit of themselves too
theres lots like as blackberries in my bar declared nathan
old fellows most times that reckon they are the only steadfast creatures left on earth while everybody else be like feathers blown about in a gale of change
every mortal man and woman be bound to change answered his brother
tis the law of nature
id give nought for a man of hard and fast opinions
such stand high and dry behind the times
but vivian would not allow this
no no humphrey that wont do
if us wasnt fixed and firm the world couldnt go on
vivian means we must have a lever of solid opinions to lift our load in the world explained nathan
of course no grown man wants to be flying to a new thing every day of his life like the young people do
the levers the bible declared humphrey
ive nought to do with any man who goes beyond that but outside that theres a margin for change as the world grows and tis vain to run your life away from the new facts the wise men find out
i dont hold with you declared vivian
at such a gait us would never use the same soap or wear the same clothes two years together
if going to run your life by the newspapers in the same case with the chaps and the donkey in the fable
what father believed and held to i shall believe and hold to for he was a better man than me and a lot more
humphrey shook his head
if we all thought so the world would stand still he replied
tis the very argument pushed in the papers today about teaching the young people
tis said they must be taught just what their parents want for m to be taught
and who knows best i should like to parents and guardians as have finished their learning years ago and be miles in their knowledge or the schoolmasters and mistresses as be up to date in their and full of the latest things put into books
theres no standing still with the world any more than theres standing still with the sun
it cant be
laws against it
we must have change admitted nathan
for sure we must
tis the only way to keep water running forward
if you block it in a pond it goes stagnant and if you block your brains they rot
then let us leave it at that said vivians wife
and now if you men have done your drink you can go off and smoke while we tidy up
but there was yet a duty to perform and nathan rose and whispered in humphreys ear
i think the times come for drinking his health
it must be done
will you propose it
his brother answered aloud
nathan wants for me to propose your good health vivian
but i bant going to
that sort of thing isnt in my line
i wish you nought but well and theres an end ont
then ill say a word declared the innkeeper returning to his place
fill your a drop more hester you must it to your own husband
and i say here in this family party that tis a proud and a happy thing to have for the head of the family such a man as our husband hester and your father you boys and girls
long may he be spared to stand up among us and set us a good example of whats brave and comely in man long may he be spared i say and from my heart i bless him for a good brother and husband and father and wish him many happy returns of his birthday
my love and honour to you vivian
they all rose and spoke after the custom of the clan
my love and honour to you brother said humphrey
my love and honour to you vivian ned said his wife
love and honour to you father murmured the boys and girls
and mark said love and honour to you uncle
there was a of liquor in the silence that followed and neds little eyes
you silly folk
he said
god knows theres small need of this
but thank you children brothers and nephew
i be getting up home to my tethers end now and cant look with certainty for over and above another ten birthdays or thereabouts but such as come well keep together if it pleases you
and if you be drinking then heres to you all at a you all not forgetting my son nathan thats sailing on the sea
ill write to nat and tell him every blessed word of it and what weve had for dinner and all said may
the company grew hilarious and nathan leaving them went to the trap that had brought him from shaugh and returned with a bottle
tis a pretty cordial he said and a all round will steady whats gone and warm our hearts
not but what warm enough already
the liquor was broached and all drank but humphrey
as good as a feast
and you can saddle my pony mark
im going home now
im glad to have been here today but im going now
they pressed him to remain but he judged the invitation to be
however he was tranquil and amiable at
to rupert he even extended an invitation
rupert was the only one of his brothers family for whom he even pretended regard
you can come and see me when youve got the time he said
ill go for a walk along with you and hear what you have to say
then he rode off but mark stopped and finished the day with his cousins
he talked to rupert and with secret excitement heard the opinions of may and polly on the subject of cora
a very glowing and genial atmosphere settled over cadworthy after the departure of humphrey ned
even the nervous mark consented to sing a song or two
the musical traditions of the neds had reawakened in him and on rare occasions he favoured his friends with old ballads
but in church he never sang and often only went there to ring the tenor bell
nathan also rendered certain comic songs and may played the aged piano
then there was dancing and dust and noise and presently the meal called high tea
hester ned protested at last against her absurdities for everybody began to roll about and ache with laughter but he challenged her criticism
clever though you all are he said no woman that ever i met was clever enough to play the fool
tis only the male creature can accomplish that
no woman ever wanted to i should hope she answered and he retorted triumphantly there you are
theres my argument in a nutshell
she was puzzled
what mean by that
she asked and from the standpoint of his nimble wit he roared
there you are again
he said
i cant explain but the lack in you be summed in the question
a hopeless case she said
we all laugh at you and yet couldnt for the life of us tell what on earth tis we be laughing at
thats the very highest art and practice of playing the fool
he told them
chapter vi where wigmore down descends in mighty shoulders clad with oak there meet the rivers plym and mew after their diverse on dartmoor
the first roars wild and broken from its cradle aloft on the waste and falls with thunder under cadworthy and beneath the the other as becomes a stream that has run through peaceful valleys by bridges and the hamlets of men shall be found to wander with more gentle current before she passes into the throbbing bosom of her sister
above them on a day in early summer the hill ascended washed with light spread hugely for the pomp of the leaf
from plym beneath flashing under their lowermost branches to the granite tonsure of the hill above ten thousand trees ascended in a shining of all garment that fitted close to the contours of each winding ridge sharp cleeve and uplifted knoll of the elevation that they covered
lustrous and shimmering this forest garb exhibited every vernal tint that nature knows for upon a prevalent triumphant fabric of were cast particular jewels and patterns against the oaken undertones where they spread a dappled verdure of amber and carmine there sprang the tardy ash shone the rowans brightness sparkled the at rivers brink and rose the emerald pavilions of the larch
beeches thrust their diaphanous foliage in veils the shadows here a patchwork of blue firs added new harmonies to the hill here the glittering birch reflected light from every tiny leaf and here the hollys sobriety was broken by inflorescence and infant foliage young and bright
the forest spread its newborn leaves under a still grey evening upon which suddenly the sun thrust through before it sank
shafts of light falling from west to east upon the planes of the woods struck out a path of sudden glory along the and thrust down in rain of red gold even to the rivers face while on self where it towered above the trees and broke the green with grey this gracious light briefly brooded and flashed genial into dark crevices and hidden nests of birds
the great rock falls by abrupt to the water it towers with pinnacle and peak aloft
planted in the side of the forest it stands veined scarred it is fretted with many colours cut and torn into all manner of fantastic shapes by work of roots and rain by centuries of storm and the chisel of the lightning
bedded here with ivy on its front the smile of evening for a crown and the forest like a green sea breaking in foam of leaves around it the water stone stood
night was already come upon its eaves and cornices from its feet ascended musical thunder of plym in a riot of rocks and aloft clashing echoing and from scarp and precipice there rang the cheerful chiming music of unnumbered jackdaws who made these crags their home
mark ned descending into the valley from shaugh beheld this scene with understanding
he had been well educated he was sentimental he regarded wild nature in a manner rare amid those born and bred upon her bosom
beauty did not find him indifferent old legends gave him joy
he knew the folktales of the land and dwelt upon them still with instinct surviving from boyhood and deliberately suffered to survive
he loved the emotion of awe and cultivated it he led a life from choice much secluded he had walked hitherto blind in so far as women were concerned but now a woman had entered his life and nature shone glorified throughout by the experience
mark was in love with cora yet this prime fact did not lessen his regard for the earth and the old stories concerning it
he found the things that were good still good but changed
his emotions were all sharpened and intensified
his strength was stronger his weakness was weaker than of yore
she was never out of his thoughts she made the sunlight warmer the birds song sweeter the night more wonderful
he woke and found himself brave enough to approach her in the deep small hours of morning but with dawn came fear and with day his courage melted
by night also he made rhymes that seemed beautiful to him and brought moisture to his eyes but when the sun came and he repeated his stumbling periods he at them and banished them
she was friendly and not averse but she was clever and had many friends among young men
nathan ned rejoiced in her and often foretold a notable match for cora
what mark could offer seemed very little to mark himself
his father indeed was reputed rich but life at revealed no sign of it
they lived hard and humphrey ned affected a frugality that would have been unusual in the homes of humbler people
humphrey had often told his son that he did not know how to spend money and as for mark until the present he had shared his fathers indifference and been well content
but he felt that cora might be fond of money and he was glad sometimes that his father spent so little because if all went well there must surely come a time when he would be able to rejoice cora with great riches
the obstacle however he felt to be himself
his distrust of himself was morbid the folk said that he was frightened of his own voice and only spoke through the tenor bell of st edwards
now he descended into the shadows of the valley and moved along the brink of plym seeking for certain young wood ripe for cutting
presently mark found what he sought but made no immediate effort to begin work
he flung down a frail which contained a and saw
then he sat upon a rock overhanging the river and buried himself in his own thoughts
a path wound beside the stream and along it suddenly the maiden of this mans dream
she looked fair enough and moved in deep apparent unconsciousness of any human presence
but her ignorance was simulated
she had seen young ned pass over the hill she had known his destination and by a detour she had entered the valley from below
now she started and exhibited astonishment
mark
whoever would have thought
what be you doing here all alone like you not a fisherman
he and grew pale
fancy meeting and i might ask what brought you cora
oh just a silly fondness for the river and the trees and my own thoughts
i like being about among the wild things though i dare say you wont believe it
of course ill believe too
dont i like being about among em better than anything else
im very pleased to meet you im sure
theres no bit of the river than here
do look fine tonight she said glancing up at the crags above them
it does then
the water stone i always call it since i read in a book that that was what it meant
tis the great stone by the water you see
have you ever heard tell of the black hunter cora
but perhaps you dont hold with such old wifes tales
she put him at his ease and assured him that she loved ancient fables and liked to go on believing them despite her better knowledge
just the same as me
he cried eagerly
the very thing i do
how wonderful you should feel the same
i know tis rubbish yet i let it go sadly
id believe in the pixies if i could
who was the black hunter if you dont mind telling me
she asked
ill sit here a bit afore i go on if it wont be to hinder you
proud i am im sure he said
and as for him the black hunter thats no more than another name for the devil himself
twas thought that hed come here by night with his great bellowing dogs and go forth to hunt souls
a horse he rode but sometimes hed set out afoot for tis well remembered how once in the deep snow on a winter morn human footprints along with were traced to the top of the hill but not down again
the devil flew away with somebody
so the old story says
but i like the thought of the little heath hounds better
for they hunt and harry old nicks self
they are the spirits of the young children who die before they are baptised and the legend hath it that they win to heaven soon or late by hunting the prince of darkness
tis the children that we bury with maimed rites upon hill in the churchyard
they put that poor woman who killed herself in the same place because the old parson wouldnt read sure and certain hope over her
but cora was not interested in his conversation though she pretended to be
she endeavoured to turn speech into a more personal road
what have you come here for
i hadnt any idea you ever took walks alone
i take poor hand at neighbouring with people i my father
but im here to handles for tools
theres no wood for light tools like alder
you know the old rhyme when allers leaf is so big as a penny the stick will wear so tough as any
thats true enough for ive proved it
set to work and ill watch you if i may
proud im sure
and ill see you home after
but theres no haste
i was thinking that bare dark corner in the garden at might do very nice for youd care
the very thing
how kind to think of it
i love the garden and the flowers
but none else cares about them
think you could get me one of they king ferns
but i suppose that would be too much to ask
ill get you more than one
ill try to plant em then but im not very clever
ill come and make a bit of a rockery myself you like
like
i should love it
but tis very good of you to bother about a stupid girl
dont you say that
far far from stupid
never was a girl im sure
she shook her head and talked about the ferns
then she became personal
ive always felt somehow with you but i suppose it bant to say such ive always felt as you understood me mark
ah
he said
and as for me ive he knows what ive felt
the man broke off and she smiled at him and dropped her eyes
she knew the thing that shared his heart with her and now spoke of it
and through you ive got to love tenor bell almost as much as you do
of a sunday the day isnt complete till ive heard the beautiful note of your bell and thought of you at the rope
i always somehow think of you when i hear that bell and i think of the bell when i see you
bant that strange
tis your wonderful quick mind and you couldnt say anything to please me better
i wanted to ask you about the bells
im so ignorant but i thought if silly of me id ask you about em
i suppose awful difficult to ring
not a bit
only wants steady practice
the whole business is little understood but tis simple enough
ive gone into it all from the beginning and im care about it
the first thing is for a ring of bells to be in harmony with itself and founders ought to be free to make em so
the bells are never better than when they are broken out of the moulds and every touch of the lathe or chip of the chisel is music lost
the thickness of the should be of the diameter you must know but modern bells are made for cheapness
long in the waist and high in the shoulder they should be for true fineness of sound but they cast em with short waists and flat shoulders now
tis easier to hang and ring them so but they dont give the same music
my tenor is a wonderful good bella maiden bell as we cast true that has never had a chip at the
i call the quick to church and dead to grave is her motto
a pennington bell she is and no ever cast a better
every year makes her sweeter for theres nothing improves like time
i suppose it wouldnt be possible for me actually to see the bells
it can be done and shall be he promised
then he went off again
ive been in nearly every and in devonshire one time and another and ive took a hand in far and wide but our ring of six for its size and weight cant be beat in the county and theres no sweeter tenor that ive heard than mine
and im very hopeful that mr dennis will take my advice and have our wheels and gear looked to and the cleaned out
tis the home of birds and the nest litter lies feet deep up there
the ladders all rotten too
we ought to have stays and slides and our ropes are a bit too heavy and lack for the sally
im hopeful hell have a care for these things
he on for it was his subject and always loosed his tongue
she was bored to death but from time to time when he feared that he wearied her she assured him that her interest did not wane and was only less than his own
he showed unusual excitement at this meeting was lifted out of himself and talked until grey gloaming sank over the valley and the jackdaws were silent
then cora started up and declared that she must return home quickly
listening to you has made me forget all about the time and everything she said
theyll wonder whatever has befallen me
ill see you home he answered
tis my fault youll be late and i must take the blame
and ive kept you from your work im afraid
thats no matter at all
tomorrow will do just as well for the alder
he rose and walked beside her
she asked him to help her at one place in the wood and her cool firm hand thrilled him
once or twice he thought to take this noble opportunity and utter the thing in his heart but he could not bring himself to do it
then at her gate he left her and they exchanged many assurances of mutual thanks and obligation
he promised to bring the ferns in three days time and undertook to spend an evening with the coras build the rockery and stay to supper with the family afterwards
he walked home treading on air with his mind full of hope and happiness
cora had never been so close as on this day she had never such an intimate glimpse of her beautiful spirit before
each word each look seemed to bring her nearer and yet when he reflected on his own imperfections a wave of doubt swept coldly over him
he in silence but after the meal he confessed the thoughts in his mind
never broke a twig this evening he said
was just going to begin when who should come along but cora
has she forgiven parson for turning her out of the choir
cant practise that at the men no more now
shes not that sort father
not with a face like hers
that girl would rather go hungry than without admiration and flattering
a little peacock and so vain as one
youre wrong there
ill swear it
shes very different to what you reckon
why this very evening there she was under the water stone all along by herself just for love of the place
often goes there she tells me
very surprised to find you
that she was
and somehow i got a silent man as me most times
but i found myself chattering about the bells and one thing and another
weve got a lot more in common than you might think
ned smoked and looked into the fire
well dont be in a hurry
im not against marriage for the young men
but bide your time till youve got more understanding of women
ill never find another like her
im sure shed please you father
youll be rich in a small way as the world goes presently
remember she knows that as well as you do
she never speaks of money
just so simple and easily pleased as i am myself for that matter
she loves natural the things you care about yourself
and very much interested in tenor bell no doubt
how did you guess that
but tis perfectly true
she is and she said a very kind thing that was very hopeful to me to hear
she said that the bell always put her in mind of me and i always put her in mind of the bell
i wonder
and did you tell her what was writ on the bell
yes i did father
and know what she thought
mark shook his head
she thought that the sooner it called you and her to church together and the sooner it called me to my grave the life would look for her hard eyes
father
tis cruel and unjust to say such things
havent i seen her there o sundays ever since she up
theres nought tells you more about people than their ways in church
as bright as a bee and smart and shining but as the nether millstone that womans heart
have a care of her thats all ill say to you
i hope to god youll know her better some day father
and i hope you will my lad and ill use your strong words too and hope to god youll know her better afore tis too late
this is cruel and im bitter sorry to hear you say it answered the young man rising
then he went out and left his father alone
elsewhere phyllis cora had eagerly inquired of cora as to the interview with the
the girls shared many secrets and were close friends
they knew unconsciously that their brother was more to the mother than were they
heathman adored mrs cora and never wearied of showing it but for his sisters he cared little and they felt no interest in him
now phyllis sympathised with coras ambitions and romances
how was it
she asked
i warrant you brought him to the scratch
tis all right declared her sister
tis so good as done
the word was on his tongue coming in the but it stuck in his throat
i know the signs well enough
however twill slip out pretty soon i reckon
hes a good sort though but hes gotten lovely eyes
ill wake him up and him up
chapter vii when man builds a hawk_house on dartmoor he plants trees to protect it
sometimes they perish sometimes they endure to shield his dwelling from the riotous and winds
round the abode of humphrey ned stood beech and pine
a solid old hawk_house lurked beneath like a bear in its grove
people likened its face to the grey worn roof to his hair and the small windows on either side of the door to his eyes
a few apple trees were in the garden and currant and gooseberry bushes prospered indifferent well beneath them
rhubarb and a row of elders also flourished here
the latter were permitted to exist for their fruit and of the berries mrs susan humphreys widowed made medicinal preparations supposed to possess value
lay under a tor and behind it the land towered to a stony waste that culminated in wild masses of piled granite where the rowan grew and the vixen laid her cubs
from this spot one might take a birdseye survey of humphrey neds domain
gold lichens had fastened on the roof and the folk conceited that since there was no more room in the old mans hawk_house for his money it began to ooze out through the tiles
humphrey himself now sat on a favourite stone aloft and surveyed his possessions and the scene around them
it was his custom in fair weather to spend many hours sequestered upon the tor
dwarf oaks grew in the and he marked the passage of the time by their activity by the coming of migrant birds by the appearance of the infant foxes and by other natural signs and tokens
beneath there subtended a great space flanked with woods
the rut as it was called fell away to farms and fertile fields and terminated in a glen through which the little torry river passed upon her way to plym
cann wood fringed the neighbouring heights and far away to the south lake extended and plymouth grey glittering under a gauze of smoke
the tor itself was loved by hawks and stoats crows and foxes
not a few people familiar with the fact that humphrey here took his solitary walks and kept long vigils would affirm that he held a sort of converse with these predatory things and learned from them their winged and cunning
his sympathy indeed was with fox and hawk rather than with hunter and hound
he admitted it but in no sense of companionship with craft did he interest himself in the wild creatures
he made no fatuous imputation of cruelty to the hawk or cunning to the fox
his bent of mind none the less inclined him to admire their singlehanded fight for life against long odds and thus he too fell into fallacy but his opinion took a practical turn and was not swiftly shattered as such emotions are apt to be when the pitied outlaw offers to the sentimental spectator a personal taste of his quality
if a hawk stooped above his chickens he felt a sort of contempt for the screaming flying the hawk help itself if it did not run for his gun
indeed he had no gun
as men said of this or that obstinate ancient that he had never travelled in a train so they affirmed concerning humphrey ned that he had never in his life fired a gun
he sat and smoked a wooden pipe and reflected on the puzzles of his days
he knew that he was held in little esteem but that had never troubled him
his inquiring spirit rose above his and he prided himself upon the fact and did not see that just in this particular of a flight too lofty did he fail of the landmarks and sure ground he sought
a discontent in substance very distinguished and noble imbued his consciousness
he was still seeking solace out of life and a way that should lead to rest
but he could not find it
he was in arms on the wrong road
he missed the fundamental fact that from humanity and service arise not only the first duties of life but also the highest rewards that life can offer
he had little desire towards his
his mind appeared to magnify their deficiencies and weakness
he was in his interpretation of motives
mankind awoke his highest impatience
he sneered at his own shortcomings daily and had no more mercy for the manifold disabilities of human nature in general
in the light of his religion and his learning he conceived that man should be by many degrees a nobler and a wiser thing than he found him and this conclusion awoke impatience and a fiery aversion
he groped therefore in a blind alley for as yet service of man had not brought its revelation to his spirit or opened the portals of content
he failed to perceive that the man who lives rationally for men with all thereby involved in his duty to himself is justifying his own existence to the limit of human capacity
instead he fulfilled obligations to his particular god with all his might and supposed this rule of conduct embraced every necessity
he despised his neighbour but he despised himself also
thus he was logical but such a rule of conduct left him lonely
hence it came about that darkness clothed him like a garment and that his kind shunned him and cared not to consider him
he sat silent and motionless
his gift of stillness had often won some little intimate glimpse of nature and it did so now
a fox went by him at close quarters
it passed absorbed in its own affairs and without fear
then suddenly it saw him braced its muscles and slipped away like a streak of cinnamon light through the stones
it made for the dwarf oaks beneath the head of the tor and the watcher saw its red stern rise and its brush jerk this way and that as it leapt from boulder to boulder
a big and powerful humphrey perceived one that had doubtless stood before hounds in his time and would again
arrived at the confines of the wood the brute hurried himself no more but rested awhile and with a sort of highwayman insolence surveyed the object of alarm
then it disappeared and the man smiled to himself and was glad that he had seen this particular neighbour
at the far below moved mrs susan
viewed from this elevation she presented nothing but a and a great white square of apron
she wore black and her bust disappeared seen thus far away though her capacious person might be noted at a mile
susan was florid taciturn and staunch to her master
if she had a hero it was ned and if she had an antipathy mr_gollop mr_gollop stood for that repugnance
of susan it might be said that she was honest and not honest
in her case though she would have scorned to take a crust she listened at doors
to steal a spoon was beyond her power but to steal information not intended for her ears did not outrage her moral sense
her rare triumphs were concerned with humphreys ragged wardrobe and when she could prevail with him to buy a new suit of clothes or burn an old one she felt the day had justified itself
now through the beneath him there ascended a man and humphrey prepared to meet his nephew
he had marked rupert speak with mrs susan and seen her point to the tor
it pleased the uncle that this youth should sometimes call upon him for he rated rupert as the and of his kindred
in a sense rupert pleased humphrey better than his own son did
a vague instinct to poetry and sentiment and things of abstract beauty which belonged as an ingredient to marks character found no echo in his fathers breast
i be come to eat my dinner along with you and fetch a message for mark began the young man
mr denniss meeting to tell everybody about the play will be held in the parish room early next month and parson specially wants you and mark to be there
theres an idea of reviving some customs
i dare say tis a very good idea and there will be plenty to lend a hand but i doubt whether mark will dress up and spout poetry for more than i would
he means to perform st
st_george next christmas and invite the countryside said ned
well one mans meat is another mans poison
hes young and energetic
hell carry it through somehow with such material as lies about him
the maidens will all want to be in it no doubt
i think tis uncle
you think wrong then
bant always to hark back to old ways
hes got his ideas for waking the people up
you and me might say dont wake em up but our business
it is his business as a minister to open their eyes and polish their senses
so let him try with childish things that hell succeed for he wont
then whats the good of trying
the man must earn his money
fancy coming to a hole like this
why even jack from as works for mr he laughs at shaugh
hes a rare radical is head
tis the likes of him the upper people dont want to teach to read or to fear of pickling a rod for themselves
but head will be thinking
hes made so
i like him
he laughed at me for one said rupert and though i laughed back i under his tongue
he says for a young and strapping chap like me to stop at cadworthy doing labourers work for my father be a and even a shameful thing
he says i ought to blush to follow a plough or move muck with the learning ive learnt
of course tis a small mean life in a manner of speaking for a man of energy as loves work like i do
ned scratched his head with the mouthpiece of his pipe and surveyed rupert for some time without speaking
then he rose sniffed the air and buttoned up his coat
well walk a bit and ill show you something he said
they set out over shaugh moor and rupert proceeded
i do feel rather down on my luck about milly
it dont seem right or fair if providence wasnt on my side
dont that nonsensical stuff said his uncle
youre the sort that cry out to providence if you fall into a bed of of getting up quick and looking for a
time to cry to providence when youre in a fix you cant get out of singlehanded
if you begin at your time of life and all about nothing too twill come to be like the cry of wolf wolf
and then when you really do get into trouble and out providence wont heed
not a small thing anyway
how can i go on digging and delving while father withstands me and wont hear a word about her
shes too good for you
i know it but she dont think so thank the lord
your fathers a man that moves in a groove
maybe you go safer that way but not further
the beaten track be his motto
he married late in life and it worked very well so it follows to his narrow mind that late in life is the right and only time to marry
i wish youd tell him that you hold with milly and think a lot of her
father has a great opinion of your cleverness im sure
not he
tis your nathan that he sets store by
quite natural that he should
hes a much man than me and knows a lot more about human nature
see how well all folk speak of him
cant you get him your side
your father would soon give ear to you if nathan approved
tis an idea
and nat certainly be kind always
i might try and get him to do something
hes very friendly with mr saul_luscombe milly uncle
how does milly view it
hell be glad to have milly off his hands
more fool him then
for theres no more understanding girl about
so jack says
bant often hes got a good word for anybody but hes told me in so many words that milly be bang out of the common
he said it because his savage opinions never her
they stood on hawk tor and beneath them stretched first the carpet of the heath
then the ground fell into a valley where water meadows spread about a stream and beyond by woods and homesteads the earth ascended again to shaugh
the village perched upon the apex of the hill like a jewel
glitter of whitewash and shone under the grey roofs sunlight and foliage sparkled and intermingled round the church tower light roamed upon the hills revealing and obscuring detail in its passage
to the far west above deep valleys the world appeared again but now it had receded and faded and merged in tender blue to the horizon
earth spread before the men in three huge and simple planes of heath and stone sloping from north to south of hillside and village and hamlet perched upon their proper crest of the dim dreaming distance swept with the haze of summer and rising to skyline
thats not big said humphrey ned
plenty of room here for the best or worse that one boy can do
but rupert doubted
think of the world out of sight uncle
this bit spread here be little more than a picture in its frame
granted but the frames wide enough to cage all that your wits will ever work
you can run here and wear your fingers to the bone without bruising yourself against any bars
go down in the churchyard and take a look at the ned of em if theres one your grandfather your the and all the rest
and every man and woman of the lot lived and died and suffered and sweated and did good or evil within this
all save the that went to foreign parts and made a fortune and sent back tons of money to father and you and nat
humphrey laughed
thou hast me there
he said
but dont be discontented
bide a bit and see how the wind blows
im not against a man following the spirit that calls him but wait and find out whether tis a true voice or only a lying echo
what does milly say
tis milly have put the thought into me for that matter
shes terrible large in her opinions
she holds that father havent got no right to refuse to let us be
shed come and talk to him if id let her
a regular she is
what would she have you do
gird up and be off
she comes of a very wandering family and of course one must allow for that
ive nought to say against it
but they cant bide in one spot long
something calls em to be roaming
the tribe of esau
they talked on and rupert found himself the better for some caustic but sane counsel
tis no good asking impossibilities from you and im the last to do it said humphrey
there are some things we cant escape from and our characters are one of them
theres no more sense in trying to run from your character than in trying to run from your shadow
too often your character is your shadow come to think on it and cruel black at that
but dont be impatient
wait and watch yourself as well as other people
if these thoughts have been put in your head by the girl they may not be natural to you and they may not be digested by you
see how your own character takes em
im not against courting mind nor against early marriages and if this woman be made of the stuff to mix well and close with your own character then marry her and defy the devil and all his angels to harm you
to take such a woman is the best days work that even the hardest working man can do in this world
but meantime dont whine but go ahead and gather wisdom and learn a little about the things that happen outside the i do
they turned presently and went back to dinner
rupert praised his uncle and declared that life looked the easier for his advice
tis no good being called the hawk if you cant sharpen your wits as well as your claws said the old man
i know what they call me well enough
i knocked a chap down last sunday on cadworthy bridge for saying it declared rupert
very thoughtful and very proper to stand up for your family but im not hurt
maybe theres truth in it
ive no quarrel with the the herons all they do eat the trout
by all accounts there was birds to eat trout afore there was men to eat em
we humans have invented a saying that possession is nine points of the law but we never thought much of that when it to knocking our weaker neighbours on the they be birds or men
youve made me a lot more contented with the outlook anyway
im glad to hear it
contents the one thing id wish wish myself
i cant see the way very clear yet
let me know if ever you come by it
you
why the most contented of any of us
come and eat and dont talk of what you know nought said ned
they went through the back yard of the homestead presently where a hot distinctive odour of pigs saturated the air
as they passed by some young very dirty pink with fat amiable voices and to their lean mother where she lay in a lair of
thats content explained humphrey it belongs to brainless things and only to them
i havent found it among men and women yet and i never count to
rainbow gold in this world
yet dont mistake me im seeking after it still
why seek for it if theres no such thing uncle
well may you ask that
but the answers easy
because tis part of my character to seek for it rupert
character be stronger than reasons self if you can understand that
i seek because im driven
you might find it after all uncle
there must be such a thered be no word for it
the older sighed
a young and hopeful fashion of thought he said
but youre out there
men have made up words for many a fine fancied thing their hearts long for but the word is out of poor human hope
he brooded deep into his own soul upon this thought and spoke little more that day
but mark was waiting for his dinner when they returned and he and rupert found themes in common to occupy them through the meal
the great project of the new vicar chiefly supplied conversation
rupert felt indifferent but mark was much interested
im very willing to lend a hand all i can and i expect the parish will support it he said
but as for myself and taking a part i wouldnt for all the world
it beats me how anybody can get up on a platform and speak a speech afore his assembled
the girls will like it foretold rupert
cora is to play a part declared mark and no doubt shell do it amazing well
rupert was up in arms at once
i should think theyll ask milly too
shes got more wits than any of em
she may have as much as cora but not more i can assure you of that answered mark firmly
he rarely contradicted a statement or opposed an assertion but upon this great subject his courage was colossal
chapter viii mr dennis and his sister made more friends than enemies
the mans and energy attracted his parishioners while miss dennis though not genial was sincere
a certain number followed the party of and mr_gollop yet as time passed it diminished
the arrived the girls were turned out of the choir but the heavens did not fall
even the nonconformists of shaugh regarded the young vicar with friendliness and when he called a meeting at the parish room nathan ned and others who stood for dissent attended it in an amiable spirit
rumours as to the nature of the proposition had leaked out and they were vague but a very general interest had been excited and when the evening came the vicar his churchwardens and friends found a considerable company assembled
there were present vivian and nathan ned with most of the formers family
mrs cora and her two daughters from also came while heathman cora ned and other young men stood in a group at the rear of the company
from arrived the saul_luscombe milly his niece milly and his man jack
people looked uneasy at sight of the last for he was a revolutionary and firebrand
the folk suspected that he held socialistic views and were certain that he worked harm on the morals of younger people
susan at her masters wish attended the meeting and sat impassive among friends
thomas and the vicarage gardener sat together but mr_gollop was not present because her services were occupied with the
a buzz and babel filled the chamber and the heat increased
jack opened a window
whereupon rose and shut it again
the action typified that eternal battle of principle which waged between them
but vivian ned was on the side of fresh air
let be
he shouted
us dont want to be roasted alive thomas
so the window was opened once more and head triumphed
dennis dennis swiftly explained his desire and invited the parish to support him in reviving an ancient and obsolete ceremonial
the oldest men among you must remember the days of the christmas mummers he said
ive heard all about them from eyewitnesses and it strikes me that to get up the famous play of st
st_george with the quaint dialogue would give us all something to do this winter and be very interesting and instructive and capital fun
there are plenty among you who could act the parts splendidly and as the original version is rather short and barren i should have some choruses written in and go through it and polish it up and perhaps even add a character or two
in the old days it was all done by the lads but why not have some lasses in it as well
however these are minor points to be decided later
would you like the play
thats the first question
it is a revival of an ancient custom
it will interest a great many people outside our parish and if it is to be done at all it must be done really well
probably some will be for it and some against
for my part i only want to please the greater number
those who are for it had better elect a spokesman and let him say a word first then well hear those who are against
the people listened quietly then they bent this way and that and discussed the suggestion
some rose and approached vivian ned where he sat beside his brother
after some minutes of buzzing conversation during which vivian shook his head vigorously and nathan as vigorously nodded the latter rose with reluctance and the folk stamped their feet
tis only because of my brothers modest nature that i get up he explained
as a church of england man and a leader among us they very properly wanted for him to speak
but he wont do it and no more will young farmer timothy and no more will mr milly of so ill voice em to the best of my power
though im of branch of the christian church yet my friends will bear me out that ive nothing but kind feeling and regard for all of them and in such a pleasant matter as this i shall do all in my power to help your reverence as we all shall
for i do think theres none but will make the mummers welcome again and lend a hand to lift the fun into a great success
me and my brother and milly and timothy and mr_gollop and and a good few more can well remember the old days and well all do our best to rub up our memories
so what we all say is go ahead mr dennis and good luck to it
applause greeted nathan
the folk were filled with admiration at his ready turn of speech
he sat down again between mrs cora and cora
everybody clapped their hands
then came a hiss from the corner where jack stood
a voice declared the clergyman
who is that
my name is jack and i be to offer objections said the man stoutly
better save your wind then
snapped
you be one against the meeting
head was a and individual of an colour
his body was long and thin his shoulders were high his expression aggressive yet humorous
he had swift wits and a narrow understanding
he was observant and impressed with the misery of the world but he possessed no philosophical formulas to balance his observation or counsel patience before the welter of life
he was honest but scarce knew the meaning of amenity
one or not wont shut my mouth he said
im a member of the parish so much as you though i dont a lot of wild nonsense come every seventh day and i say that to spend good time and waste good money this way be a disgrace and a going back instead of going forward
what for do we want to stir up a lot of silly dead foolishness that our grandfathers invented
bant there nothing better to do with ourselves and our wits than dress up like a shipload of monkeys and go
we might so well start to wassail the and put mourning on the when a man dies
im against it and i propose instead that mr dennis looks round him and sees what a miserable jakes of a mess his parish be in and spends his time trying to get the landlords to order
order
withdraw that
cried out furiously
how dare this infidel man up and say the parish be in a jakes of a mess
wheres ben north
im here thomas said a policeman who stood at the door
a silly old replied jack
to hear you about this truth
ill tell you this my brave hero
when the devil was showing the lord the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of em he kept his thumb on shaugh so as none should see what a of a place it was
order
order
cried miss dennis and grew livid
i appeal to the chair
i appeal to the nation
he gasped
then he shook his fist at jack
theres no yet explained dennis
as soon as we decide ill take the chair and well appoint a committee to go into the matter and arrange the parts and so on
the first thing is are we agreed
one loud shout attested to the sense of the meeting
then mr_head youre in a minority of one and i hope we may yet convince you that this innocent revival is not a bad thing said dennis
and further than that you mustnt run down shaugh in this company
weve got a cheerful conceit of ourselves and why not
dont think im dead to the dark side of human life and the sorrows and sufferings of the poor
i hope youll all very soon find that im not that sort or my sister either
and the devil himself cant hide shaugh from the lord and saviour of us all no fear of that
sit down jack and say sorry cried mr milly
not me replied head
ive stated my views at a free meeting and im on the losing side like men of my opinions always be where parsons have a voice
but me and my friends will be up top presently
turn him out ben north
shouted but ben north refused
indeed he was of jacks party
done nought but say his say and i shant turn him out the policeman answered
theres nobody in the chair yet and therefore theres none here with power to command the law to move
a committee was swiftly formed
it consisted of the clergyman and certain parishioners
nathan joined it for his family mr milly also joined and dennis promised that certain local antiquaries and the lord of the manor would assist the enterprise
while we are here he said we may as well get the thing well advanced and decide about the characters
all those interested are here so why not let me read through the old play as it stands
then well settle the parts and each can copy his or her part in turn
theres nothing like being admitted nathan
lets have it by all means
we shall want young and old to play if my memory serves me
we shall and a good company to sing the songs that i hope to add
my sister our organist will undertake the music
and right well shell do it without a doubt declared nathan
on all hands tis admitted how the church music has mended a lot since she took it up
mr dennis then read a version of the old play and its ingenuous humour woke laughter
now said the vicar when his recital was at an end ill ask those among us who will volunteer to and come forward
especially i appeal to the ladies
theyll have to say very little
only to look nice and im sure that wont cost em an effort for they cant help it declared nathan
none immediately rose
then ned strolled down the room
young man in shaugh cried an anonymous voice
and the laziest
answered another unknown
there was a laugh and ned turned ruddy
never take trouble enough to learn thy part ned
cried heathman cora
play turkish knight my son said his father
then thou be knocked on the head and die comfortable without more trouble
others followed ned and mr dennis called for mark
youll not desert us mark
i shall want your help i know
and glad to give it answered the young man
he grew very hot and nervous to find himself named
his voice broke he coughed and cut a poor figure
somebody patted him on the back
dont be mark said vivian ned his reverence only wants for you to do what you can
he wouldnt ask impossibilities
mrs ned compared her handsome son to stammering mark and felt satisfied
cora also contrasted the young men and in her bosom was anything but satisfaction
you neednt act but you must help in many ways
youre so well up in the old about our legends and customs explained the clergyman
we count on you
and now we want some of the older men among you and when weve settled them we must come to the ladies
were getting on splendidly
set a good example thomas
me
cried
me to
whoever heard the like
you must play thomas urged vivian ned of cadworthy
such a voice cant be lost
what a king of egypt the man will make
ill do a part if you will but not else returned mr_gollop and the ned family lifted a laugh at their fathers expense
for that matter ive took the stage often enough admitted vivian but twas to work not to talk
all the same if his reverence would like for me to play a part why im ready and willing so long as there isnt much to say to it
hurrah for mr
ned
shouted several present
and nathan must play too declared
no revel would be complete without him
if youll listen ill tell you what i think said the clergyman
ive considered your parts during the last five minutes and they go like this in my mind
lets take them in order ned
will you do ned
yes if you cant find a better said the young man
good
now the turkish knight comes next
he must be young and a bit of a fighter
will you be turkish knight mr
timothy
he addressed a young dark man who farmed land in the parish and dwelt a few miles off
mr timothy laughed and nodded
try
well done
dennis smiled and looked at mr_head play the oblige us all
everybody laughed including jack himself
the very living man for bear
cried mr milly
i command you jack to be bear
you aint got much to do but growl and fight jack and youre a at both said heathman
well ive said my say returned mr_head and i was in a minority
but since this parish wants for me to be bear ill bear it out so well as i can and if i give a bit of a hug afore he bowls me over he mustnt mind that
capital
thank you jack
now wholl be father christmas
i vote for nathan ned
applause greeted the suggestion but miss dennis bent over from her seat and whispered to her brother
he shook his head however and answered under his breath
it doesnt matter a button about his being a dissenter
so much the better
lets draw them in all we can
you ought to choose the church people first
its done now anyway he replied
everybody likes the man
we must have him in it or half the folk wont come
the king of egypt is next said nathan after he had been duly elected to father christmas
i say thomas here for the part
i dont play nought answered thomas firmly unless vivian ned do
hes promised
ill be giant then and say
answered the farmer
twill be a terrible for ned here and i warn him that if he dont fight properly valiant i wont die
the very only man for giant declared dennis dennis
so thats settled
now whos for doctor
thats a very important part
i suppose your father wouldnt do it mark
hes just the face for a doctor
my brother
cried vivian
good lord
hed so soon stand on his head in the marketplace as lend a hand in a bit of nonsense like this
ask milly here
will you be doctor saul_luscombe
but mr milly refused
not in my line
heres doctored a lot of things in his you
will you be doctor
asked mr dennis
but refused
too much to say he answered
i might it with a bit of sweat but i should never call it home when the time came
be the french eagle suggested mark ned
youve got but little to say and soon settles you
and the very living nose for it urged
very well if the meeting is for it ill be eagle assented mr joe_voysey
the part of doctor remained unfilled for the present
now theres the fair princess sabra and mother dorothy explained the vicar
princess sabra the king of egypts daughter will be a novelty for she didnt come into the old play in person
she doesnt say anything but she must be there
miss cora for princess sabra
said mark
everybody laughed and the young man came in for some chaff but dennis approved and mrs cora nodded and smiled
cora and nathan patted mark on the back
a good idea and were all for it he said
to cora as the belle of the village belonged the part by right
she was surprised and gratified at this sudden access of importance
then the vicar prepared to close his meeting
for mother dorothy we want a lady of mature years and experience
the part is often played by a man but i would sooner a lady played it if we can persuade one to do so he said
mrs susan
mrs
susan
shouted a mischievous young man at the back of the hall
never said susan calmly
not that id mind but whatever would my master say
let my sister play the part suggested thomas
mr_gollop mr_gollop fears nought on two legs
shell go bravely through with it
nathans heart sank but he could not object
the company was divided
then to the surprise of not a few mrs susan spoke again
the hated name had dispelled her doubts
ill do it and chance master she said
yes theres no false shame in me i believe
ill do it rather than youre made for the part maam declared nathan much relieved
and very fine youll look
youve got to kiss father christmas at the end of the play though
i hope you dont mind that
thats why shes going to act the part
shouted heathman and laughter drowned mrs susans reply
in good spirits the company broke up and the young folk went away excited the old people interested and amused
merriment sounded on the grey july night many women about the play till long after their usual hour for sleep and plenty of coarse jests as to the promised entertainment were uttered at the bar of the white thorn presently
as for the vicar and his sister they felt that they had achieved a triumph
two shadows alone darkened the outlook in miss denniss eyes
she objected to the nonconformist element as undesirable or unnecessary and she did not like the introduction of queen sabra
that showy girl is quite conceited enough already she said
but her brother was young and
shes lovely though he said
by jove
the play will be worth doing if only to see her got up like a princess
dont be silly dennis answered his sister
shes a rude wretch and the coras are the most independent people in the parish
chapter ix at high summer two men and two maids kept public holiday and wove romance under the great crown of pen beacon
from this border height the south hams spread in a mighty vision of rounded hills and plains whole forests were reduced to squat green cushions laid upon the broad earths bosom and amid them wedges and squares of ripening corn shone root crops smiled water meadows and spread the emerald faces of shorn
it was a day of lowering clouds and illumination breaking through them
fans of light fell between the and the earth was mottled with immense alternate patches of shadow and sunshine
thick and visible strata of air hung heavy between earth and sky at this early hour
they presaged doubt and comprehended a condition that might presently diffuse and lift into glory of august light or darken to thunderstorm
southerly the nakedness of hanger down and the crags of eastern and western beacons towered while to the east were hill three barrows and the featureless expanses of stall moor
northerly towered and the waste spread beyond it in long leagues whose planes were flattened out by distance and distinguished against each other by sleeping darkness and waking light
a heaviness that stained air at earths surface persisted even on this lofty ground and the highest passages of aerial radiance were not about the sun but far beneath it upon the horizon
rupert ned doubtfully forward sniffing the air and watching the sky while beside him came milly and a quarter of a mile behind them walked mark and cora
the men had arranged to spend their holiday up aloft and milly was well pleased but cora held the expedition vain save for what it should accomplish
to in the moor when she might have been at a holiday revel was not her idea of pleasure but as soon as mark issued his invitation she guessed that he did so with an object and promised to join him
as yet the definite word had not passed his lips though it had hovered there but today miss cora was resolved to return from pen beacon betrothed
as for mark his hope chimed with her intention
cora was always gracious and free of her time while he played the devout lover and sincerely held her above him every way
only the week before heathman obviously inspired to do so had asked him why he kept off and declared that it would better become him to speak
and now feeling that the meal presently to be taken would be of a more joyous character after than before the deed he stopped cora while yet a mile remained to trudge before they should reach the top of the tor
rest a bit he said
let rupert and milly go forward
they dont want us and we shall all meet in the old up over where were going to eat our dinner
looks as if twas offering for bad weather she answered lifting her eyes to the sky
im glad i didnt put on my new muslin
she sat on a stone and felt that he was now going to ask her to marry him
she was not enthusiastic about him at the bottom of her heart but she knew that he would be rich and a good match for a girl in her position
she was prone to exaggerate her beauty and had hoped better things from it than mark ned but certain minor romances with more important men had come to nothing
she was practical and made herself see the bright side of the contract
he was humble and she could influence him as she pleased
he worshipped her and would doubtless continue to do so
once his wife she proposed to in him a better conceit of himself and when his father died she would be able to blossom out as she put it to her sister and hold her head high in the land
there were prospects
nathan ned was rich also and he was childless
he liked mark well and on one occasion when she came into the farm kitchen at suddenly she overheard nathan say to her mother no at alla capital match for her
mark put down the basket that carried their meal and took a seat beside cora
going to rain he said
i always know by my head if theres thunder in the elements
it gets a sort of heavy aching feeling
look yonder the clouds are levelling off above the moor so true as if theyd been planed
thats the winds work
why theres enough blue showing to make you a new dress cora
id love a dress of such blue as that
blues my colour she said
yes it you look lovely enough in any colour
i like to please you mark
oh cora and dont you please me
little you you know
ive had it on my tongue a thousand it seems too such as me to you
why theres none you look to and if youd come of a higher youd have been among the loveliest ladies in the land
and so you are now for that youre hid away in this savage old a beautiful pearl under the wild sea
this had long been coras own opinion
she smiled and touched the hair on her hot forehead
if there comes on a fog i shall go out of curl in a minute she said
then seeing that this prophecy silenced him she spoke again
i love to hear you tell these kind things mark
id sooner please you than any man living
perhaps tis in me to say so but im telling nought but truth
truth bant often so beautiful as that he said slowly
and tis like your brave heart to say it out and heres truth for your truth cora
if you care to hear me say i think well of you then i care to hear you speak well of me and more nobody elses good word is better than wind in the trees against your slightest whisper
so that i please you i care nothing for all the world and if youll let me ill live for you and die for you
for that matter ive lived for only you these many days and if youll marry out
im a vain chap even to dare to say it but tis you have made me your kind words and thoughts for thoughts that peep out and dear little kind things done by you and forgotten by you but never by me cora
can you do it
can you sink down to me or is it too much of a drop
others have lowered themselves for love and never regretted it
tis a fall for such a bright lovely star as you but my loves ready to catch you so you shant hurt yourself
ii he broke off and she seemed really moved
she put her hand on his two which were knotted together and then she looked love into his straining eyes and nodded
his hands opened and seized hers and squeezed them till she drew in her breath
then he put his arms round her and kissed her
dont move for gods sake
he said
know what youve done
given myself to a dear good chap she answered
in her heart she was thanking heaven that she had not worn the new muslin dress
weather or no weather hed have creased it and mangled it all over and ruined it for ever she thought
they proceeded presently but made no haste to overtake their companions
their talk was of the future and marriage
he pressed for an early union she was in no hurry
you must learn a bit more about me first she told him
maybe im not half as nice as you think
and theres your father
im terrible frightened of him
you need not be cora
hes not against early marriage
you must come and see him pretty soon
hell be right glad for my sake though hell be sure to tell me ive had better luck than i deserve
she considered awhile without speaking
im afraid i shant bring you much money she said
whats money
thats the least thing
i shall have plenty enough no doubt
what will your father do
then theres your nathan
hes terrible rich by all accounts and he thinks very well of you
i shall be all right
but im a lazy lazy
i shall turn my hand to something steady when were married
such a dreamer you are
not but what with all your great cleverness you bant worth all the young men put together for brains
im going to set to
my fathers often at me about wasting my life
but though hed scorn the word hes a bit of a dreamer his way
youd never guess it but he spends many long hours all alone brooding about things
and hes a very clever man
he marks the seasons by the things that happen out of doors
hell come down off our tor that cheerful sometimes you wouldnt believe twas him
curlews back on the moor hell say one day then another day oaks are budding then again first frost tonight or thunders coming
his bark is worse than his bite really
tis his terrible eyes i fear
they look through you
he makes me feel small and i always hate anybody that does that
you mustnt hate him
too many do already
but be better to feel sorry for him
hes often a very unhappy old man
i feel it but i cant see the reason and he says nothing
she
i wish i hadnt got to see him
why his own he cant hit it off with him
and im sure there must be something wrong with a man that cant get on with nathan
everybody is fond of him but ive often heard him say leave it interrupted mark
i know all that cora
tis just one of those puzzles that happen
tis no good fretting about anybody else what youve got to do is to make my father love you
and youve only got to be yourself and he must love you
of course ill do my best
give me just one more lovely kiss before we get over the hilltop and come in sight of them
were to meet at the old mens camp
she kissed him and then silence fell between them
it lasted a long while until he broke it
dont fancy because im so still that im not bursting with joy he said
but when i think of whats happened to me this minute i feel tis too big for words
the thoughts in me cant be spoken cora
they are too large to cram into little pitiful speeches
im getting hungry and theres milly waving she answered
hungry too
eastward under pen beacon lay an ancient lodge of the neolithic people
the circles of scattered granite shone grey set in foliage and fruit of the bilberry with lichens on the stone and mosses woven into the grass about them
a semicircle of hills extended beyond and formed a mighty theatre where dawn and storm played their parts where falling night was pictured largely and moonshine slept upon lonely heights and valleys
in the glen beneath spread wood with fringes of larch and pine hiding the river and spreading a verdant medley of deep summer green in the lap of the grey hills
gold autumn flashed along the waste and the pink ling broke into her first tremble of colourless light that precedes the blush of fulness
the party of four sat in a hut circle and spoke little while they ate and drank
rupert unknown to the rest and much to his own inconvenience had dragged up six stone bottles of hidden under his coat
these he produced and was much applauded
a spring broke at hand and the bottles were sunk therein to cool them
they talked together after a very practical and businesslike fashion
milly and rupert were definitely engaged in their own opinion and now when mark who could not keep in the stupendous event of the moment announced it they congratulated the newly engaged couple with the wisdom and experience of those who had long entered that state
tis a devilish condition i can promise you said rupert and the man always finds it so if the girl dont
hanging on is just in my case where i cant get father to see with my eyes
but thank god
she wont change
no said milly i shant change
tis you have got to change
i respect your father very much like the rest of the world but because he didnt marry till he was turned thats no reason why you should wait twenty years for it
anyway if you must so will i shall be a thought elderly for the business by that time
however it rests with you
im what she means explained rupert
jack and me have had a talk and hes thrown a lot of light on things in general
i cant be bound hand and foot to my father like this and if he wont meet me i must take things into my own hands and leave home
mark was staggered at the enormity of such a plan
dont do anything in a hurry and without due thought
very well for you to talk said milly
you do nought but ring the bells on sundays and play at work the rest of the week
mr humphrey wont stand in your way
i suppose you could be married afore christmas if you pleased
she sighed at the glorious possibility
i hope we shall be but coras in no hurry im afraid
and when ive got work continued rupert then i shall just look round and take a hawk_house and marry and why not
your father will never let you go
it isnt to be thought upon declared mark
then he must be reasonable
he appears to forget im nearly answered his cousin
conversation ranged over their problems and their hopes
then rupert touched another matrimonial disappointment
it looks as if we were not to be fortunate in love he said
theres ned terrible down on his luck
hes offered marriage farmer chaves second daughter and twas as good as done but mr wouldnt hear of it and hes talked the girl round and neds got
serve him right said milly
he jilted two girls
twill do him good to smart a bit himself
the chaves are a lot too high for us asserted mark
hes a very wellborn and rich man and his father was a justice of the peace and known in london
he only farms to amuse himself
twas neds face i reckon said cora
they women are both terrible stuck up
makes me sick to see em in church all in their clothes
but fine feathers wont make fine birds of them
both flat as a plate and a lot older than they pretend
ned is well out of it i reckon
he dont think so however replied rupert
ive never known him take any of his affairs to heart like this one
moped and he is and creeps about with a face as long as a fiddle and off his food too
poor chap said cora
even talks of ending it and making away with himself
terrible hard hit i do believe
your mother must be in a bad way about him said milly
she is
why he took mother down to the river last sunday and showed her a big hole there where plym comes over the rocks and the waters all and twelve feet deep
thats where youll find me mother he says
and she poor soul was frightened out of her wits
and fathers worried too for ned cant go wrong with him
ned may always do what he likes though i may not
cora declared her sympathy but mark did not take the incident as grave
you neednt fear he assured neds brother
men that talk openly of killing themselves never do it
words are a
tis the sort that go silent and cheerful under a great blow that be nearest death
cora spoke of neds looks with admiration and feared that this great disappointment might spoil them but milly was not so sympathetic
if he stood to work and didnt think so much about the maidens they might think a bit more about him she said
he swears he wont play now added rupert
he havent got the heart to go no more
hell find twenty girls to go philandering after afore winter foretold milly
and if cora here was to ask him hed play fast enough
twill be a very poor compliment to me if he cries off now declared cora
for im to be the princess and tis pretended in the play that hes my true lover
mark will be jealous then
tis a pity he dont play said milly
but mark laughed
a pretty me
he answered
no no im not jealous of ned
safety in numbers they say
let him be and welcome and very noble hell ever hes got brains enough in his empty to get the words and remember them
cora cast a swift side glance at her betrothed
she did not speak but the look was not all love
discontent haunted her for a little space
the was drunk and the repast finished
the men lighted their pipes the girls talked together
milly congratulated cora very heartily
hes a fine witty chap as ive always said
different to most of us along of being better
but that modest and retiring few people know what a clever man he is
these things pleased the other and she was still more pleased when milly discussed marks father
i often see him she than you might think for
hell ride to twice and thrice a month sometimes
why for
to see my uncle you might fancy
but thats not the reason
to talk with jack he comes
jack and me be the only people in these parts that bant afraid of him
and thats what he likes
you be fearless of him cora or hell think nought of thee
fearless and attentive to what he the rule with him
and pretend nothing or hell see through it and pull you to pieces
him and jack says the most tremendous things about the world and its ways
they take uncle breath away sometimes and mine too
but dont let him frighten the fatal thing
if a creatures feared of him he despises it
never look surprised at his speeches
cora listened to this advice and thanked the other girl for it
why should i care a button for the old man anyway
she asked
if it comes to that im as good as him
theres nought to fear really when alls said
and i wont fear
the men strolled about the old village and gathered then rupert judged that the storm that had so long to the north was coming at last
wed best be getting he said
lets go across to then if it breaks we can slip into the warren hawk_house a bit till the worst be over
you be all coming to drink tea there said milly
uncle saul_luscombe and jack are away but aunt be home and i made the cakes specially o saturday
drifting apart by a half a mile or so the young couples left the beacon climbed and thence passed over the waste to where the red tor rose above home
a sort of twilight stole at four oclock over the earth and it seemed that night hastened up while yet the hidden sun was high
the sinister sky darkened and frowned to bursting yet no rain fell and later it grew light again as the sun sinking beneath the ridges of the clouds flooded the moor with the greatest brightness that the day had known
chapter x some few weeks after it was known that young mark ned would marry cora a small company drank beer at the white thorn and discussed local politics in general and the engagement in particular
the time was three in the afternoon
theyll look to you for a wedding present without a doubt said to nathan who stood behind his bar
and theyll be right answered the innkeeper
im very fond of em both
youll be put to it to find rich gifts for all your young people however
thats as may be
if the lord dont send you sons the devil will send you know the old saying
not but what vivians boys and girls are a very nice loti like em all very well indeed
marks enough but made of another clay
his mother was a retiring humble of her own shadow you might say
however cora will wake him into a conceit of himself
there was an interruption for dennis dennis suddenly filled the doorway
the very men i want he said then he entered
fine sweltering weather for the harvest your honour piped an old fellow who sat on a settle by the window with a mug of beer beside him
so it is abel and i hope theres another month of it to come
give me half a pint of the mild will you ned
tis about the rehearsal ive looked in
thursday week is the seven oclock sharp remember
and im very anxious that everybody shall know their words
it will save a lot of trouble and help us on
ive got mine very near said nathan
so have i declared
here i the king of egypt boldly do appear st st walk in my only son and heir
yes but you mustnt say h eir the h isnt sounded you know
has anybody seen ned
i heard that he was in trouble
not at all said nathan
hes all lazy rascal
twas only another of his silly bits of work with the girls
running after mr chaves daughter
like his cheek
mr dennis looked astonished
i thought mr he said
exactly vicar you thought right
tis just his handsome face makes my nephew so pushing
we be a yeoman race we neds though said to be higher once but of course as things are ned looking there was just infernal impudence though his good old father my brother couldnt see it
hes only blind when neds the matter
twas said he was going to jump in the river declared the ancient abel
nonsense and rubbish
declared nathan
neds not that sort
wait till he sees himself in the glittering armour of and hell soon forget his troubles
we must talk about the dresses after rehearsal
a good many can be made at home
be you going to charge at the doors
asked
i dont see why for we shouldnt
yes certainly i am answered dennis
the money will go to the bells
thats settled
well remember
and stir up thomas
you can do anything with him but i cant
remind him about the french eagle
hes only got to learn six lines but he says it makes his head ache so badly that hes sure hell never do it
ill try and fire the mans pride declared
not a day over and hes got a very fair share of intellect
he shall learn it if ive got to teach him
thats right
now i must be off
when the vicar was gone mr_gollop reviewed the situation created by young denniss energy and tact
i never could have foreseen it yet the people somehow make shift to do with him
it dont say much for him but it says a lot for our sense and patience
wem always ready to lend the man a hand in reason and i wish he was more grateful but i shouldnt call him a grateful man
of course this here will draw the eyes of the country on us and hell get the credit no doubt yet twill be us two men here in this and you will make or mar all
im very glad to help him
hes a good chap and my sort
lots of fun in the man when you know him
cant say i look at him like that
hes not enough beholden to the past in my opinion
however i believe hes woke up a bit to who i am and what my sister is answered mr_gollop
not your fault if he hasnt
and another dont take himself seriously enough continued the parish clerk
as a man i grant you he has got nought to take seriously
hes young and hes riddled with evil modern ideas that would land the country in ruin if followed
but apart from that as a minister he ought to be different
i hate to see him running after the ball at cricket like a
decent and it lessens the force of the man in the pulpit come sunday just as it lessened the force of physician dawe to tavistock when he took to singing comic songs at the penny readings
why twas money out of the doctors pocket as he lived to find out too late
when old master trelawny lay dying and they axed un to let dawe have a slap at un he wouldnt do it
be that the man that sang the song about locking his into the
he axed
the same said they but hes a terrible clever chap at the stomach and may save you yet if there be enough of your organs left for him to work upon
no no says old trelawny
such a feller as that couldnt be trusted with a dying mans belly
i dont say twas altogether reasonable because the wisest must the bow now and again but i will maintain that that minister of the lord didnt ought to take off his coat and get in a common sweat afore the people assembled at a cricket match
tis worse than david making a circus of himself afore the holy ark and if he does so he must take the consequences
the consequences be that everybody will think a lot better of him as a manly and sensible chap wishful to help the young men declared ned
one thing i can bear witness to i dont get the saturday custom i used to get and thats to the good anyway
then he looked at his watch and changed the subject
mrs coras daughter is paying a sort of solemn visit to my brother today and they are all a little nervous about it
hell terrify her out of her wits said
he takes a dark delight in scaring the young people
that tis his manner
he dont mean to hurt em
a difficult man however as i know only too well
if he cant get on with you theres a screw loose in him remarked the old man sitting on the settle
i wont say that abel but i dont know why tis that hes got no use for me
no loss however asserted thomas
a cranky and heartless creature
the likes of him couldnt neighbour with the likes of enough human kindness in him
like our father afore him and yet harder explained the publican
i can see my parent and grim and awful old to my young eyes
well i remember the first time i felt the sting of him
a terrible small boy i cast my short frocks i id sinned in some little matter and he give me my first flogging
and the picture ive got of father be a man with a hard set face with a bit of a grim smile on it and his right hand hidden behind him
but i what was in it
a great believer in the rod
he beat us three of wed wriggle and twine like a worm on a hook but our uncle the he was as different as you and gentle like my nephew mark and all for spoiling with and toys
rose to depart and others entered
then nathan called a and left the bar
i promised mrs cora as id go down to hear what cora had to say he explained
im very hopeful that shes had the art to win humphrey for twill smooth the future a good bit for the people at if my brother takes to the wench
youd think nobody could help a lovely face as she has
however we shall know how it fell out inside an hour or so
meanwhile cora clad in her new muslin had faced humphrey ned and faced him alone
for her future expressly wished this and mark was from home on the occasion of his sweethearts visit
cora arrived twenty minutes before dinner and watched susan dish it up
she had even offered to assist but susan would not permit it
better you go into the parlour and keep cool my dear she said
youll need to be
masters not in the best of tempers today
and your young man left a message
he be gone to plympton and will be back by four oclock so when you take your leave you are to go down the rut and meet him at torry brook if you please
wheres mr
ned
taking the air up pon top the tor
he there most mornings till the dinner hour and hed forget his meal altogether so often as not but i go to the hedge and ring the dinner bell
then he comes down
how can i best please him susan
by listening first and by talking afterwards
he dont like a chatterbox but he dont like young folk to be too silent neither
twill be a of luck if you can get on his blind side
few cani warn you of that
hes very fond of natural wild things
if you was to talk about the flowers and show him you be fond of nature it might be well
however do as you will hell find out the truth of e
im all of a tremor
i wish you hadnt told me that
mark might have told you
still for your comfort it may be said youre built the right way
youll be near so as i be come you pass fifty
he hates the sort
be cheerful 1 delicate
eat hearty dont leave nothing on your plate and wait for him to say grace afore and after meat
the rest must fall out according to your own sense and wit
now i be going to ring the bell
i half thought that he might come part of the way to meet me
you thought wrong then
he dont do that sort of thing
i wish mark was here susan
so does mark
but master has his own way of doing things and tis generally the last way that other people would use
mrs susan rang the bell and the thin black figure of humphrey ned appeared and began to creep down the side of the hill
he had of course met cora on previous occasions but this was the first time that he had spoken with the girl since her betrothal
he shook hands and hoped that her mother was well
a harvest to make up for last year he said
you ought to be lending a hand by rights
i dont think ned would like for polly and me to do that
tis too hot she said
nathan wouldnt
surely he would
many hands make light work and save the time
youre a strong girl arent you
strong as a pony sir
dont call me sir
and youre fond of wild nature and the mark tells me
that i am and the wild flowers
why didnt you wear a bunch of em then
better them than that rose stuck in your belt
gold by the look of itthe belt i mean
2 withered
she laughed
ill let you into the secret she said
i wanted to be smart today and so i took one of my treasures
youll never guess where this gold belt came from mr
ned
dont like it anyway he answered
why twas the round my grandfathers hat
he was a beadle up to some place nigh london and twas an heirloom when he died and mother it to me and here it is
he regarded the relic curiously
a funny world to be sure he said
little did that bygone man think of such a thing when he put his braided hat on his head ill warrant
he relapsed into a long silence and coras remarks were rewarded with no more than nods of affirmation or negation
then suddenly he broke out on the subject of apparel long after she thought that he had forgotten it
terrible tearing fine i suppose you think your clothes are young tearing fine but i hate em and they ill become a poor mans wife and a poor mans daughter
my mother wore her hair back light and plain with a forehead cloth and a little blue baize rochet over her breast and a blue apron and short gown and and she looked ten thousand times finer than ever you looked in your ever can in that piebald flimsy with those godless smashed birds on your head
what care you for nature to put a bit of a dead creature pon top of your hair
a nasty fashion and im sorry you follow it
she kept her temper well under this terrific onslaught
we must follow the fashion ned
but ill not wear this hat again afore you since you dont like it
going to be married and live up to your knees in clover eh
so you both think
now tell me what you feel like to my son please
i love him dearly im sure and i think hes a very clever chap and quite the gentleman in all his ways
though he might dress a bit smarter and not be so friendly with the other
because they are commoner men than him of course
quite the
whats a gentleman
oh dear ned youll spoil my dinner with such a lot of questions
to be a gentleman is to be like mark i and quick to see what a girl wants and to be handsome and be well thought of by everybody and all the rest of it
you go a bit too high at instep he said
youre too vain of your pretty face and you answer rather
you dont know what a gentleman is for all you think yourself a fine lady
and ill tell you this very few people do know what a gentleman is
you can tell a lot about people by hearing them answer when you ask them what a gentleman is
where would you like to live
where please mark best
and if the things i say offend you im sorry for it
you must make allowances ned
im young and ive not got much sense yet but i want to please want to please everybody for that matter
this last remark much interested her listener
he started and looked at the girl
then his expression changed and he appeared to stare through her at somebody or something beyond
behind cora the old man did indeed see another very clearly in his minds eye
after a painful silence she spoke again and her tone was troubled
i want to say the thing that will please you if i can
but i must be myself
im sorry if you dont like me
you must be yourself and so must i he answered and if im not liking you youre loathing me
but were getting through our dinner very nicely
will you have any more of this cherry tart
no ive done well
youve eaten nought to name
ive spoiled your appetite and youve done more than you think and taught me more than you know yourself
she shrugged her shoulders
mark says puzzling things like that sometimes
there was another silence
you ride a pony dont you
he asked presently and the girl brightened up
ned possessed some of the best ponies on dartmoor and sold a noted strain of his own raising
hes going to make it up with a pony
thought sanguine cora
i do
im very fond of riding
like it better than walking i dare say
yes i do
and youd like driving better still perhaps
no i wouldnt
what are the strangles
he asked suddenly and grimly
its something the ponies get the matter with them
of course but what is it
how does it come and why
is it infectious
is it ever fatal to them
she shook her head
i dont know nothing about things like that
no use having a pony if you dont understand it
the strangles are infectious and sometimes fatal
dont forget that
cora felt her temper struggling to break loose
she poured out a glass of water
i promise not to forget it she answered
shall i put the cheese on the table for you
no i thank youll eat some
nothing more im sure
well walk out in the air then
with your love of nature youll like the growing things up on top of my hill
mark will be back for tea i think
but maybe youll not stop quite so long as that
ill stop just as long as you like she said
but i dont want to tire you
youve got your mothers patience and plenty of it i see
thats a good mark for you
patience goes a long way
you can keep your temper for you that you can
though whether tis nature or art in you he broke off and she followed him out of doors
upon the tor he asked her many things concerning the clouds above them the cries of the birds and the names of the flowers
the ordeal proved terrible because her ignorance of these matters was almost absolute
at last unable to endure more she fled from him pleaded a sudden recollection of an engagement for the afternoon and hastened homeward as fast as she could walk
once out of sight of the old man she slowed down and her wrongs and crowded upon her and made her bosom pant
she clenched her hands and bit her handkerchief
she desired to weep but intended that others should see her tears
therefore she controlled them until she reached home and then she cried copiously in the presence of her mother her sister and nathan ned who had come to learn of her success
the directions of mark to meet him at torry cora had entirely forgotten
nor would she have kept the appointment had she remembered it
in her storm of passion she hated even mark for being his fathers son
nathan was indignant at the recital and mrs cora showed sorrow but not surprise
twas bound to be difficult she said
he sent mark away you see
he meant to get to the bottom of her
a very wanton unmanly thing declared nathan
im ashamed of him
dont you take it too much to heart answered the mother
maybe he thought better of cora than he seemed to do
hes always harsh and hard like that to young people but it means nought
i believe that coras a bit frightened thats all
we must see him said nathan
at least i must
i make this my affair
twill be better for me to do so
i tried that hard to please the man sobbed cora but he looked me me to pieces with his eyes like a savage dog
nothing was right from my head to my heels
flouted my my angered seemingly because i couldnt tell him how to cure a pony of me to tell the name of every bird on the bough and weed in the gutter
and not a spark of hope or kindness from first to last
he did say that id got my mothers patience and thats the only pat on the back he gave me
patient
i could have his ugly face down with my nails
her mother stroked her shoulder
hush
she said
dont take on about it
we shall hear what mark has got to tell
i dont care what hes got to tell
im not going to be scared out of my life and bullied and trampled on by that old beast
no more you shall be cried nathan
hell say tis no business of mine but everything to do with is my business
ill see him
hes always hard on me now ill be hard on him and learn him how to treat a woman
dont go in heat urged mrs cora after cora had departed with the sympathetic phyllis
theres another side you know
coras not his sort
no doubt her fine would go in em though i advised her doubt they made him cranky and then things went from bad to worse
tis not a bit of use talking to me hester
im angered and naturally angered
in a way this was meant to anger me im afraid
he well knows how much you all at are to me
twas to make me feel small as much as anything that he snubbed her so cruel
not hear you on the now
ill see him today
i far to wait till you are cool
hell be more reasonable too tomorrow when hes forgotten a little
what is there to forget
the prettiest and cleverest girl in in the county for that matter
dont stop me
im going this instant
its dangerous nat
hell only tell you to mind your own business
no he wont
even he cant tax me with not doing that
everything is my business if i choose to make it so
anyway all at are my business
he left her but by the time he arrived at corner on the way to nathan ned had changed his mind
another aspect of the case suddenly presented itself to him and as he grew calmer he decided to keep out of this quarrel though natural instincts drew him into it
a few moments later as thought progressed with him he found himself wishing that humphrey would die
but the desire neither surprised nor shocked him for he had often wished it before
humphreys life was of no apparent service to humphrey while to certain other people it could only be regarded in the light of a hindrance
chapter xi some days later mark ned spoke with mrs cora and she was relieved to find that coras fears had been exaggerated
he said very little indeed about her except that he didnt like her clothes and that she had a poor appetite explained mark
of course i asked him a thousand questions but he wouldnt answer them
i dont think he knows in the least how he flustered cora
he said one queer thing that i couldnt see sense in though perhaps you may
he said shes told me more about herself than she knows more than ill tell to you though some might think it a reason against her
whatever did he mean by that
but it dont much matter anyway and my coras quite wrong to think she was a failure or anything of that kind
he asked only this morning as natural as possible when she was coming over again
these statements satisfied the girls mother but they failed to calm cora herself
she took the matter much to heart caused her lover many unquiet and anxious hours and refused pointblank for the present to see ned
then fell the great first rehearsal of the christmas play and dennis dennis found that he had been wise to take time by the in this matter
the mummers assembled in the parish room and the vicar and his sister with nathan neds assistance strove to lead them through the drama
its not going to be quite like the version that a kind friend has sent me and from which your parts are written explained dennis
ive arranged for an introduction in the shape of a prologue
i shall do this myself and appear before the curtain and speak a speech to explain what it is all about
this answers mr timothy here who is going to be the turkish knight
he didnt want to begin the piece
now i shall have broken the ice and then he will be discovered as the curtain rises
mr timothy timothy on this occasion however began proceedings as the vicars prologue was not yet written
he proved but exceedingly nervous
open your doors and let me in i hope your favours i shall win
whether i rise or whether i fall ill do my best to please you all
mr timothy spoke and his voice proved a little out of control but everybody congratulated him
how he rolls his eyes to be sure said vivian ned
a very daps of a turk for sartain
you ought to stride about more timothy suggested ned who had cheered up of recent days and was now standing beside cora and other girls destined to assist the play
the great thing is to stride about and look it mr
dennis
well talk afterwards answered dennis
we mustnt interfere with the action
you have got your speech off very well timothy but you said it much too fast
we must be slow and distinct so that not a word is missed
timothy who enjoyed the praise of his friends liked this censure less
as for speaking fast he said the man would speak fast
because he expects will be on his tail in a minute
he says i know hell pierce my skin
in fact hes pretty well sweating with terror from the first moment he comes on the stage i should reckon
but mr dennis was unprepared for any such subtle rendering of the turkish knight and he only hoped that the more ancient would not come armed with equally obstinate opinions
well talk about it afterwards he said
now you go off to the right timothy and father christmas comes on at the left
christmas please
nathan put his part into his pocket marched on to the imaginary stage and bowed
everybody cheered
you neednt bow explained dennis but the innkeeper differed from him
im afraid i must your reverence
when i appear before them the people will give me a lot of applause in their usual kindly fashion
why even these actors do you you may be sure that the countryside will
therefore i had better practise the bow at rehearsal if youve no great argument against it
all right push on said dennis
we must really be quicker declared miss dennis
half an hour has gone and weve hardly started
off i go then and i want you you vivian and you jack and you tom watch me acting
acting bant the same as ordinary talking
if i was just talking i should say all quiet without flinging my arms about and walking round and stopping and then away again
but in acting you do all these things and instead of merely saying your speeches as we would just man to man over my bar or in the street you have to em out so that every soul in the audience catches em
having thus explained his theory of histrionics ned started and with immense and original emphasis and sudden actions and gestures introduced himself
here come i the dear old father christmas
welcome or welcome not i hope old father christmas will never be forgot
a room here gallant boys and give us room to rhyme nathan broke off to explain his reading of the part
when i say make room i fly all round the stage as if i was pushing the people back to give me room
he finished his speech and and mopped his head
thats acting and what think of it
he asked
they all applauded vigorously excepting who now prepared to take his part
nathan then left the stage and the vicar called him back
you dont go off he explained
you stop to welcome the king of egypt
beg pardon answered the innkeeper
but of course so it is
ill take my stand here
you bow to the king of egypt when he comes on declared mr_gollop
he humbly bows to me dont he reverend dennis
yes said dennis he bows of course
youll have a train carried by two boys mr_gollop but the boys arent here tonight as theyre both down with bassetts youngsters
ill bow to you if you bow to me tom said ned
thats only right
kings dont bow to common people declared the parish clerk
me and my pretended miss cora whos the going to bow i should hope
you ought to then declared jack
no reason because king of egypt why you should think yourself better than other folk
make him bow nathan
dont you bow to him if he dont bow to you
kings do bow declared dennis
you must bow to father christmas mr_gollop
he must bow first then argued the parish clerk
damn the man
turn him out and let somebody else do it
cried head
let neither of em bow suggested mrs susan suddenly
with all this here bowing and scraping us shant be done afore midnight and i dont come in the play till the end of all things as tis
youd better decide your reverence suggested vivian
your words law
i say let em bow would that serve
excellent
declared dennis
youll bow together please
now mr
mr_gollop
thomas marched on with an amazing gait designed to be regal
theyll all laugh if you do it like that tom complained mr joe_voysey
beggar the man
and why for shouldnt they laugh
asked jack
thomas dont want to make em cry do he
bant we all to be as funny as ever we can reverend dennis
yes said dennis
in reason jack
but acting is one thing and playing the fool is another
oh lord
i thought they was the same declared vivian ned
because if ive got to act the giant order
order
cried the clergyman
we must get on
dont be annoyed ned i quite see your point but it will all come right at rehearsal
youll have to tell me how to act then said vivian
how the mischief can a man pretend to be what he isnt
a giant youre as near being a live giant as you can be declared nathan
youve only got to be yourself and youll be all right
no argued jack
if the mans himself hes not funny and nobody will laugh
i say you can show us what you mean when you come to your own part jack said dennis desperately
do get on mr_gollop
bow then said to nathan
ill bow when you do and not a minute sooner answered the innkeeper firmly
the matter of the bow was arranged and in the familiar voice with which he had led the psalms for a quarter of a century began his part
here i the king of egypt boldly do appear st
st
walk in my only son and heir walk in st my son and boldly act thy part that all the people here may see thy wondrous art
well done tom
said mr dennis thats splendid but you mustnt sing it
i bant singing it answered the clerk
i know what to do
all right
now where are you
along with the girls as usual snapped
as a matter of fact ned was engaged in deep conversation with princess sabra and the turkish knight
he left them and hurried forward
give tongue ned
cried his father
you walk down to the footlights and the king of egypt will be on one side of you and father christmas on the other explained the vicar
and you neednt look round for the females cause they dont appear till later on added jack
a great laugh followed this jest whereon miss dennis begged her brother to try and keep order
if they are not going to be serious we had better give it up and waste no more time she said
dont take it like that miss i beg of you urged nathan
alls prospering very well
we shall shape down
go on ned
ned looked at his part then put it behind his back and then brought it out again
this is too bad ned complained dennis
you told me yesterday that you knew every word
so i did yesterday ill swear to it
i said it out in the kitchen after supper to i father
you did assented vivian but thats no use if youve forgot it now
tis stage fright explained nathan
youll get over it
think talking to a maiden advised jack
do get on
cried dennis
then he prompted the faulty
here come i ned struck an attitude and started
here come i from britain did i spring ill fight the russian bear my wonders to begin
ill pierce him through he shall not fly ill cut him how does it go
ill cut him down prompted dennis
right
ill cut him down or else ill die
good
now come on bear
said nathan
you and jack will have to practise the fight explained the vicar and at this point or earlier the ladies will march in to music and take their places because of course fair sabra has to see conquer his foes
thatll suit ned exactly
laughed nathan
then he marshalled cora and several other young women including may and polly ned from cadworthy and coras sister phyllis
there will be a lifted up at the back you a raised platform
but for the present you must pretend these chairs are the throne
you sit by fair sabra thomas and then the trumpets sound and the bear comes on
wholl play the brass music
asked head because ive got a very clever friend at leave all that to me
the music is arranged
now come on
shall you come on and play it like a thing or get up on your hindlegs jack
asked
i be going to come in growling and on all fours declared mr_head grimly
then i be going to do a sort of a comic bear dance then i be going to have a bit of fun eating a plum pudding then i thought that me and nathan might have a bit of comic work and then i should get up on my hindlegs and go for st
st_george
you cant do all that declared dennis
not that i want to interfere with you or anybody head but if each one is going to work out his part and put such a lot into it we shall never get done
the thing is to make em laugh reverend dennis answered jack with firmness
if i just come on and just say my speech and fight and die theres nought in it but if go on on
well talk afterwards
right
now you try not to laugh souls and i wager ill make you giggle like a lot of promised jack
then he licked his hands went down upon them and scrambled along upon all fours
good for you jack
well done
funnier than anything thats gone afore
cried
so you be for certain added mrs susan
for all the world like my sheepdog declared mr timothy
now i be going to sit up on my hams and scratch myself explained mr_head then off i go again and have a sniff at father christmas
then you ought to give me a plum pudding ned and i balance it pon my nose
well thought on
declared nathan
so i will
twill make the folk die of laughing to see you
come on to the battle said dennis
must be a sort of fight continued head because the bears got nought but his paws
then i thought when id a fair back heel hed get up and draw his shining sword and stab me in the guts
then id roar and roar till the place fairly echoed round and then id die in frightful agony
you bant the whole play jack said with much discontent
you forget yourself surely
you cant have the king of egypt and these here other high characters all standing on the stage doing nought while going through these here vagaries
but mr_head stuck to his text
wem here to make em laugh he repeated with bulldog determination
and ill do it if mortal man can do it
then when ive took the doctors stuff up i gets again and goes on funnier than ever
i wouldnt miss it for money jack declared vivian ned
such a clever chap as you be and none of us ever it
you ought to go for tom fool to the riders
3 i lay youd make tons more money than ever you will to warren
3 the riders a circus
by the way who is to be the doctor
asked ned
settled mr
dennis
dennis collapsed
by jove no
more it was he admitted and ive forgotten all about it
the doctors very important too
we must have him before the next rehearsal
for the present you can read it out of the book mark
mark ned was prompting and now after and the bear had made a pretence of wrestling and the bear had perished with much noise and to the accompaniment of loud laughter mark read the doctors somewhat arrogant pretensions
all sorts of diseases whatever you pleases the the palsy the gout if the devils in i blow him out
i carry a bottle of here russian bear take a little of my pour it down thy rise up and fight again
well said mark
twas splendidly given
why for shouldnt mark be doctor
asked nathan
an excellent idea declared dennis
im sure now if the fair queen sabra will only put in a word marks engagement was known
the people clapped their hands heartily and cora
i wish he would said cora
your wish ought to be his law declared ned
im sure if twas me but mark shook his head
i couldnt do it he answered
i would if i could but when the time came and the people and the excitement of it all i should break down im sure i should
its past ten oclock murmured miss dennis to her brother
the rehearsal proceeded jack as the bear was restored to life and slain again with much detail
then ned proceeded i fought the russian bear and brought him to the slaughter by that i won fair sabra the king of egypts daughter
where is the man that now will me defy
ill cut his full of holes and make his buttons fly
and when ive got my sword of course twill be much finer concluded ned
here raised an objection
i dont think the man ought to tell about cutting anybodys full of holes he said no nor yet making their buttons fly
tis very coarse and the wouldnt like it
nonsense tom answered the vicar its all in keeping with the play
theres no harm in it at all
evil be to them as evil think said jack
now comes the song reverend dennis and i was going to propose that the bear though hes dead as a nit rises up on his front paws and sings with the rest then drops down souls
theyll die of laughing if you do that jack declared vivian
i vote for it
but dennis firmly refused permission and addressed his chorus
now girls the joins
the other songs are not written yet so we need not bother about them till next time
the girls glad of something to do sang vigorously and the song went well
then the turkish knight was duly slain restored and slain again
we cant finish tonight declared dennis looking at his watch so im sorry to have troubled you to come mrs susan and you joe_voysey
they havent wasted their time however because head and i have showed them what acting means said nathan
and when you do come on susan youve got to quarrel and pull my beard remember then we make it up afterwards
well finish for tonight with the giant decreed dennis
now speak your long speech and then ned can do the giant
ned who declared that he had as yet learned no more read his next speech and vivian began behind the scenes
i smell the blood of an englishman
let him be living or let him be dead ill grind his bones to make my bread
you ought to throw a bit more roughness in your voice farmer suggested
if you could bring it up from the innards sound more awful wouldnt it reverend dennis
and when you come on farmer you might pass me by where i lie dead said jack and ill up and give you a nip in the calf of the leg and youll jump round and the people will roar again
no declared the vicar
no more of you head till the end
then you come to life and dance with the french joe_voysey
but you mustnt act any more till then
a pity answered jack
i was full of contrivances however if you say so be i to dance
asked mr joe_voysey
this is the first ive heard tell o that
how can i dance and the rheumatism eating into my knees for the last twenty year
ill dance said head
you can just turn round and round slowly
now mr
ned
vivian strode on to the stage
make your voice big my dear pleaded mr_gollop
here come i the giant bold turpin is my name and all the nations round do tremble at my fame i go they tremble at my sight no lord or champion long with me will dare to fight
people will cheer you like thunder vivian said his brother because they know that the nations really did tremble at your fame when you was champion wrestler of the west
but you mustnt stand like that farmer said jack
too
for the lords sake man try and keep your feet in the same parish
ned with laughter and slapped his immense thigh

thats funnier than anything in the play he said
keep my feet in the same parish
was ever a better joke heard
now kill the giant commanded dennis
the giant will have a club and hell try to smash you then you run him through the body
take care you dont hit ned in real earnest however else youd settle him and spoil the play said mr joe_voysey
be a terrible for certain if the giant went and whipped st
st_george
be the first time however said ned
would it ned
nathan and neds sisters appreciated this family joke
then advanced a sentimental objection
i may be wrong he admitted but i cant help thinking it might be a bit for ned here to kill his father even in play
you see though everybody will know tis ned and his parent and that only pretending yet it might shock a person here and there to see the son kill the father
i dont say i mind as tis all and the frolic of a night there tis
a silly old grandmother and never no king of egypt was such a fool afore said jack
pay no heed to him reverend dennis
mr_gollop snarled at head and they began to wrangle fiercely
then dennis closed the rehearsal
thatll do for the present he announced
weve made a splendid start and the thing to remember is that we meet here again this day week at seven oclock
and mind you know your part ned
another of the songs will be ready by then and the new harmonium will have come that my sister is going to play
and do look about all of you to find somebody who will take the doctor
we shall have the nations eyes on for the first time declared as he tied a white wool muffler round his throat and im sure i hope one and all will do the best thats in em
the actors departed the oil lamps were extinguished and the vicar and his sister returned home
she said little by the way and her severe silence made him rather nervous
well he broke out at length jolly good i think for a first alice
im glad you were satisfied dear
everything depends upon seems quite clear at any rate
theyll all get terribly and silly im afraid long before the time comes
however we must hope for the best
but i shouldnt be in a hurry to ask anybody who really matters
chapter xii in a triangle the wild land of the rut sloped down from to the valley beneath and its solitary time of splendour belonged to spring when the great were blooming and the white thorns filled the valley with light
hither came mark to keep tryst with cora beside the stream
he walked not but languid for his mind was in trouble and his gait reflected it
to waters brink he came sat on a familiar stump above torry brook and watched sunshine play over the ripples and a dance of flies upon the sunshine
looked at in a mass the insects seemed no more than a glimmering like a heat haze over the water and against the background of the woods but noted closer the plan and pattern of these myriads showed method the little storm of flies in a circle and while the whole cluster swept this way and that with the proper motion of the mass yet each individual like planets round the sun revolved about a definite but shifting centre
the insects whirled round and round rose and sank again each atom describing repeated circles and though the united motion of this company suspended here in air appeared rapid and dazzling yet the progress of each single gnat was not fast
mark observed this little galaxy of glittering lives and knowing some natural history he considered intelligently the thing he saw
for a moment it distracted him
a warm noon had innumerable brief existences that a cold night would still again
all this immense energy must soon cease and the ephemeral atoms perish at the chill touch of evening but to nature it mattered neither more nor less if a dance of or a dance of gnats should make an end that night
countless successions of both were a part of her work
from awful marriages of ancient suns new suns would certainly be born and out of this midge dance here above the water potential dances for another day were ensured before the little system sank to rest the aureole of living light became extinguished
he turned from the whirl and wail of the gnats to his own thoughts and found them also revolving restlessly
but their sun and centre was cora
he had asked her to meet him here in a favourite and secret place that he might speak harsh things to her
there was no lovemaking toward just now
she had angered him once and again
he considered his grievances strove to them and see all with due allowance but his habit of mind if vague was not unjust
he loved her passionately but that she should put deliberate indignities upon him argued a faulty reciprocity of love
time had revealed that cora did not care for mark as well as he cared for her and that would not have held it reasonable
but he desired a larger measure of affection and respect than he had received
then to his quick senses even the existing affection diminished and respect appeared to die
these dire shadows had risen out of the rehearsals for the play
coras attitude towards other young men first astonished mark and then annoyed him
he kept his annoyance to himself however for fear of being laughed at
then thanks to his cousin ned and the young farmer timothy timothy he was laughed at for cora found these youths better company than mark himself and jack and others did not hesitate to rally him about his indifferent lady
shes more gracious with either of them than with me he reflected
why actually when i offered as usual to walk home with her last week she said yonder man had promised to do so and she need not trouble me
as he spoke he lifted his eyes where a farm showed on the hills westerly through the trees
was a prosperous place and the freehold of a prosperous man young timothy the turkish knight of the play
he had seen cora home according to her wish and mark had kept his temper and afterwards made the present appointment by letter
now cora came to him late from another concerning it she said nothing
on her way from it happened that she had fallen in with marks father
the old man rode his pony and cora was passing him hastily when he stopped and called her to him
they had not met since the occasion of the girls first and last visit to
come hither he said
ive fretted you it seems and set you against me
im sorry for that
you should be made of stouter stuff
shake hands with me cora please
he held out his hand and she took it silently
ill turn and go a bit of your road
if you intend to marry my son you must make shift to be my daughter you see
what was it made you so cross that you ran away
but i spoke against your clothes
you spoke against everything
i felt in every drop of blood in my body that you didnt like me
thats why i had to run
he was silent a moment
suddenly he pointed to one faint gold torch above their heads where a single bough of an elm was and began to glow on the bosom of a tree still green
it stood out shining against the deep summer darkness of the foliage
what make of that
he asked
she looked up
tis winter coming again i suppose
for us death for the leaves
im like frostbitten here and therein places
twas a frosty day with me when you came to dinner
im sorry i hurt you
but you must be sensible
its a lot harder to be a good wife than a popular maiden
my son mark will need a woman not a silly one
the question is are you going to rise to it
however well leave that
how did you know in every drop of your blood as you say that youd failed to please me
i knew it by everything
by your eyes and by the tone of your voice
you said you wanted to talk to me
well i did
you never asked me nothing
there was no need you told me everything
i said nought im sure
you said all i wanted to hear and told me a lot more than i wanted or expected to hear for that matter
im sure i dont understand you mr
ned
no need
thats only to say youre like the rest
they wonder how tis they dont understand that they yet how many understand themselves
ill tell you this youre not the right wife for mark
then i wont marry him
theres quite as good as him and better for that matter
plenty
take young timothy from farm for instance
a strong man he is
my son mark is a weak mana gentle character he hath
tis the strong that want alter the face of the world and make history and help the such as mark
hed spoil you and bring out all the very worst of you
such a man as timothy would do different
hed not stand your airs and graces and little silly whims and fancies
hed break you in hed tame you and youd look back afterwards and thank god you fell to a strong man and not a weak one
women marry for love not for taming she said
some perhaps but not you
you bant built to love if you want to know the whole truth he answered calmly
you belong to a sort of woman who takes all and gives nought
i wish i could ope your eyes to yourself but i suppose thats beyond human power
but this ill say i wish you nothing but good and the best good of all for such a one as you is to get a glimpse of yourself through a sensible and not pair of eyes
if you are going to marry mark and want to be a happy woman and wish him to be a happy man you must think of a lot of things beside your wedding frock
for two pins i wouldnt marry him at all after this she said
youd break any girls heart speaking so straight and coarse to her
i bant accustomed to be talked to so cruel and i wont stand it
i do beg you to think again he said stopping his pony
im only telling you what ive often told myself
im always open to hear sense from any man save now and again when i find myself in a black mood and wont hear anything
but green girl as havent seen one glimpse of the grey side tis frank foolishness to refuse good advice from an old man
you dont want to give me good advice she answered and her face was red and her voice high you only want to make me think small things of myself and despise myself and to choke me off mark
to choke you off mark might be the best advice anybody could give you for that matter my dear and as to your thinking small things of such luck i see
youll go on thinking a lot of your little empty self till you stop thinking for good and all
life bant going to teach you anything worth knowing because youve stuffed up your ears with and vanity
so go your way but if you get a grain of sense come back to me and i shall be very glad to hear about it
he left her standing still in a mighty temper
she felt inclined to fling a stone after him
and yet she rejoiced at the bottom of her heart because this scene made her future actions easier
only one thing still held her to mark ned and that was his money
the sickly ghost of regard for him which she was pleased to call love existed merely as the answer to her own appeal to her conscience
she had never loved him but when the opportunity came she could not refuse his worldly wealth and the future of successful comfort it promised
now however were appearing others who attracted her far more
two men had entered into her life since the rehearsals and both pleased her better than mark
one she liked for his person and for his charms of manner and of speech the other for his masterful character and large prosperity
one was better looking than mark and knew far better how to worship a woman the other was perhaps as rich as mark would be and he appealed to her much more by virtue of his masculinity and vigour
ned had actually mentioned this individual during the recent conversation and it was of him too that mark considered where he sat and for cora by the stream
but though she felt timothy timothys value yet a thing even stronger drew her to the other man
ned was the handsomest most fascinating creature that cora had ever known
chance threw them little together until the rehearsals but since then they had met often and advanced far along a road of mutual admiration
like clove to like and the emptiness of each heart struck a kindred echo from the other but neither appreciated the hollowness of the sound
under these circumstances humphrey neds strictures though exceedingly painful to her were not unwelcome for they made the thing that she designed to do reasonable and proper
it would be simple to quote his father to her betrothed when she threw him over
in this temper cora now appeared to mark
had he been aware of it he might have hesitated before adding further fuel to the flames
but he began in a friendly fashion rose and kissed her
youre late cora
look here
sit down and get cool and watch these flies
the merry dancers they are called and well they may be
tis a regular old country measure they seem to tread in the in and cross over and like you do when you go through the old dance in the play
but she was in no mood of softness
a tidy lot of dancing ill get when im married to you
you know you hate it and hate everything else with any joy and happiness to it
youre only your father over again when alls said and god defend me from him
i cant stand no more of him and i wont
youve met him
said mark
i was afraid you might
im sorry for that
not so sorry as i am
if i was dirt by the road he couldnt have treated me worse
and im not going to suffer once if he was ten times your father
what did he say
what didnt he say
not a kind word anyway
and tis vain your sticking up for him because he dont think any better of you than he do of me seemingly
twas to that man he pointed
she raised her arm towards the farm through the trees
he thinks a lot more of timothy timothy than he does of you i can tell you
ill talk to father
this cant go on
no it cant go on
lifes too short for this sort of thing
i wont be bullied by anybody
people seem to forget who i am
you mustnt talk so cora
im terrible sorry about it but fathers father and hell go his own rough way and you ought to know what way that is by now
dont take it to means well
heart
ive got no heart according to himno heart no sense no nothing
just a dummy to show off pretty clothes
he never said that
yes he did and worse and im tired of it
youre not the only man in the world
nothing is gained by my quarrelling with father
i suppose not but ive got my and i cant marry the son of a man that despises me openly like he does
i wont be bullied by him i promise cruel hunks he is and would gore me to pieces if he dared
no better than a mad bull i call him
tis no good your my father cora said mark
perhaps not and tis no good his me
very different to your uncle vivian im sure
always a kind word and a pat on the cheek got and so have your nathan
uncle vivian can be hard enough my cousin rupert that means to marry milly will tell you
in fact ruperts going away because he wont stand his father
why dont you go away then
if you were worth your salt youd turn your back on any man living who has treated me so badly as your father has
were in for a row it seems answered mark and id better begin and get a painful job over
when youve heard me ill hear you
in the matter of my father ill do what a son can i promise you but theres something on my side too
say it out sooner the better
she found herself heartily hating mark and was anxious to break with him while angry because anger would make an unpleasant task more easy
in a word its ned and that man over
these rehearsals of the know very well how you carry on cora and you know very well right or
youve promised to marry me and you are my life and soul but i cant share you with no other man
you cant flirt with ned while youre engaged to me you cant ask timothy to see you home of a night while youre engaged to me
you dont know what youre doing
why bant you more dashing then
she asked
you about so mean and humble
why dont you take a part in the play and do as other men and talk louder and look people in the face as if you wasnt feared to death of em
if you grumble then ill grumble too
you havent got enough pluck for me
neds different and sos man for that matter
i see how much they admire me i know how they would go through fire and water for me
not they
master can roll his eyes and roll his voice on
finish what youve got to say
ive only got to say that theres a deal about ned you might very well copy in my opinion
hes a man anyway and a handsome man for that matter
and if youre going to fall out with your father then youll lose your money and im not going to fall out with him
you neednt fear that
then more shame to you for keeping friendly with a man that hates me
call that love
ned have done about ned
he cried out
neds a lazy laughingstock of every decent man and sane woman in shaugh
a
you think hes fond of you i suppose
i know he is
and you know it
yes just as fond of you as he is of every other girl that will let him be
anything that wears a petticoat can get to his empty fool
love
what does he know of great bleating baby
his love isnt worth the wind he takes to utter it and youll very soon find that other girls you listen to him
he knows what pleases a woman anyway
cora
cora
what are you saying
want to drive me mad
he started up and stared at her
be driving you far
better sit down again and listen to me now
ill listen to nothing
im stifling
to think that god for such a man as that he rushed away frantically and she saw him no more
he had not given her time to strike the definite blow
but she supposed that it was as good as struck
after such a departure and such words they could not meet again even as friends
the engagement was definitely at an end in her mind for by no stretch of imagination might this be described as a lovers quarrel
all was over she rejoiced at her renewal of liberty and resolved not to see mark any more no matter how much he desired it
she flung away the luncheon that she had brought and set off for home trusting that she might meet humphrey ned upon the way
she longed to see him again now and repay him for a little of the indignity that he had put upon her
but she did not meet marks father
on the evening of the same day a congenial spirit won slight concessions from her
ned arrived on some pretext concerning the play
he knew very well by this time that in the matter of her engagement cora was a victim and he felt as he had often felt before in other cases that she was the only woman on earth to make him a happy man
he despised mark and experienced little compunction with respect to him
upon this night mrs cora was out and cora made no objection to putting on her hat and going to the high ground above shaugh to look at the moon
take above ten minutes and then ill see you back said ned
they went together and he flattered her and paid her many compliments and humbled himself before her
she and was pleased
they moved along together and he told her that she was like the princess in the play
you say nought but my god you look every inch a princess
if twas real life id slay fifty giants and a hundred bears for you cora
dont you begin that silliness
im sure you dont mean a word of it ned
if you could see my heart cora youd see only one name swear it
what about rubbed out i suppose
they never were there
all the other girls were ghosts beside you
not one of them suddenly near at hand the church bells began to throb and tremble upon the peace of moonlit night
marks out of the way then said ned
not that im afraid of him or any other man
youre too good for mark million times too good for him
im bound to tell you so
im sick of him and his she said violently

thats strong he exclaimed
so would any maiden be
he puts tenor bell afore me
tis more to him than ever i was
in a word ive done with the man
you splendid plucky creature
twas bound to come
such a spirit as yours never could have a worm like him
youre free then
yes i am
elsewhere in the belfry mark rang himself into better humour
the labour his grief and soothed his soul
he told himself that all the fault was his and when the chimes were still he put on his coat and went to to beg forgiveness
phyllis met him
coras out walking she said
out walking
who with
he asked
but phyllis was nothing if not cautious
she had more heart but not more conscience than her sister
i dont i think she answered
chapter xiii a day of storm buffeted the moor
fitful streaks of light roamed through a wild and silver welter of low cloud and now they rested on a pool or river and the water flashed and now they fired the crests of the high lands or made the ruddy flame
behind shaugh moor was and beneath it oozing out into the valleys extended the sullen green of waterlogged fields hemmed in with autumnal hedges
hither came mark ned on his way to shaugh and then a man stopped him and changed his plan
for some time he had neither seen nor heard from cora and unable longer to live with this cloud between them mark was now on his way to visit her
consideration had convinced him that he was much in fault and that she did well to keep aloof until he came penitent back again but he had already striven more than once to do so and she had refused to see him
he told himself that it was natural she should feel angered at the past and natural that she should be in no haste to make up so serious a quarrel
but the catastrophe had now shrunk somewhat in his estimation and he doubted not that cora during the passage of many days also began to see it in its proper perspective
he did not wholly regret their difference and certain words that she had spoken still stung painfully when he considered them but the dominant hunger in his mind was to get back to her kiss her lips and hear her voice again
he would be very circumspect henceforth and doubtless so would she
he felt sure that cora regretted their difference now and that the time was overripe for reconciliation
the next rehearsal would take place upon the following day and mark felt that friendly relations must be reestablished before that event
he was on his road to see cora and take no further denial when her brother met him and stopped him
lucky i ran against you said heathman ive got a letter for you from my sister and meant to leave it on my way out over to lee moor
coarse weather coming by the look of it
thank you answered mark
youve saved me a journey then
i was bound for
heathman who knew that he bore evil news departed quickly while the other with true instinct of held the precious letter a moment before opening it
it happened that cora seldom wrote to him for they met very often but now having a difficult thing to say she sought this medium and mark knowing not the truth was glad
like keep it up no more he thought
i almost wish shed let me say i was sorry first but she might have heard me say so a week ago if shed liked
thank heaven we shall be happy again before dark
ill promise everything in the world she wants to the ring with the blue stone she after at plymouth
he looked round then the wind hustled him and the rain broke in a tattered veil along the edge of the hill
ill get up to hawk tor and lie snug there and read her letter in the lew place i filled with fern for her he thought
there was a natural cavern facing west upon this height and here in a nook sacred to cora he sat presently and lighted his pipe and so came to the pleasant task
he determined that having read her plea for forgiveness it would be impossible to wait until nightfall without seeing her
ill go down and take dinner with them he decided then he read the letter dear mark after what happened a little while ago you cannot be surprised if i say i will not marry you
there is nothing to be said about it except that i have quite made up my mind
i have thought about it ever since and not done nothing in a hurry
we would not suit one another and the older we grew the worse we should quarrel
so it will be better to part before any harm is done
you will easily find a quieter sort of girl without so much spirit as me
and she will suit you better than what i do
i have told my mother that i am not going to marry you
and nathan ned your own uncle though he is very sorry indeed about it is our family friend and adviser and he says it is better we understand and part at once
i hope you wont make any fuss as nothing will change me
and you will have the pleasure of knowing your father will be thankful
no doubt you will soon find a and nicer girl than me and somebody that your father wont treat the same as he treated yours truly cora
through the mans stunned grief and above the chaos of his thoughts one paramount and irrevocable conviction reigned
cora meant what she wrote and nothing that he had power to say or to do would win her back again
she would never change she had seen him in anger and the sight had determined her she had met his father and had felt that such antagonism must ruin her life
he possessed imagination and was able swiftly to feel what life must mean without her
he believed that his days would be impossible henceforth
he read the letter again and marked how she began with restraint and gradually wrote herself into anger
she when she reflected on his father and he soon convinced himself that it was his father who had driven her to these conclusions
he told himself that he did not blame her
the pipe in his mouth had been given to him by cora
he emptied it now put it into its case rose up and went home
he planned the things to say to his father and determined to show him the letter
mark desired to make his father suffer and did not doubt but that he would suffer when this catastrophe came to his ears
then his father appeared before him far off driven by the wind and mark out of his tortured mind marvelled to think that a thing so small as this dim spot hastening like a dead leaf along should have been powerful enough and cruel enough deliberately to ruin his life
for he was now obsessed by the belief that his father alone must be thanked for the misfortune
they came together and humphrey shouted to be heard against the riot of the wind
his hat was pressed over his ears the tails of his coat and the hair on his head leapt and danced his eyes were watering
a brave wind
might blow sense into a man if anything could
what are you doing up here
read that said the other and his father stopped and stared at him
despite the rough air and the wild music of heath and stone marks passion was not hidden and his face as well as his voice proclaimed it
see what you have done for your only son he cried
humphrey held out his hand for the letter took it and turned his back to the wind
he read it slowly then returned it to mark
she means that he answered
this isnt the time to speak to you
i know all thats moving in you and i guess how hard life looks
but i warn you be just
im used to be misread by the people and care nought but id not like for you to misread me
you think that ive done this
i know you done it with malice aforethought too
the only thing ive ever loved in only thing that ever into my days to make em worth you go to work behind my back to take it away from me
and me as good a son to you as my nature would
as good a son as need be hoped fori grant that
but show a little more sense in this
use your brains of which youve got too many for your happiness and see the truth
can a father choke a girl off a man if she loves the man
was it ever heard that mother or father stopped son or daughter from loving
tis against nature and nought i could have said and nought i could have done would have come between her and if shed loved you worth a curse
but she didnt
she loved the promise of your money
she loved the thought of being the grey mare and playing with a weak mans purse
she loved to think on the future when i was underground and her way clear
and that hope would have held with her just as strong after knowing me as before knowing me
the passing trouble of me and my straight sour speeches and my eyes looking through her into her dirty little heart wouldnt have turned the girl away from you if shed loved you honestly
why even lust of money would have been too strong to break down under alone love of man
tis not i but somebody else has her away from thee
and the time will come when you may live to thank your god that its happened so
but enough of that
i can bear your hard words mark and bitter though twill sound upon your ear ill tell you this im thankful above measure shes flung you over
tis the greatest escape of your life and a blessing in more reasons than you know or ever will
and as for him thats done it nought that you can wish him be likely to turn out much worse than what hell get if he marries that woman
1 enticed and tempted
shouldnt i know if twas another man
she was friendly and frank with all
she hadnt a secret from me
twas only my own blind jealousy made me think twice about it when she talked with other men
but she did talk with em and you did think twice
and you didnt like it
and you quarrelled eh
and that was the sense in sense trying to lift you above the blind instinct youd got for her
would you have quarrelled for nothing
are you that sort
too fond of taking and offering the other cheek you i was once
you cant blind me
youve suffered at her hands already and spoken and this is her slap back at you
no need to drag me in at all then though i did give her raw sense for her dinner when she came to see me
look further on than your father for the meaning of this letter
look to yourself first and if that dont throw light look afield
theres more than swear it
seek a man with money and with a face like a barbers image and not sense
thats the sort will win her and thats the sort will suit her
and now ive done
they walked together and said the same things over and over again as people are prone to do in argument
then they separated in heat for the father lost patience and again declared his pleasure at this accident
whereon mark cried out against him for a callous and brutal spirit and so left him and turned blindly homeward
he did not know what to do or how to fight this great tribulation
he could not believe it
he came back to at last and found himself in an angle of the dwelling out of the wind
here reigned artificial silence and peace
the great gale roared overhead but beneath in this nook not a straw stirred
he stood and stared at his fallen hopes and ruined plans while from a dry spot beside the wall there came to him the sweet sleepy of chickens that together under their mothers wings
chapter xiv while the desolation of mark ned came to be learnt and some sympathised with him and some held that cora had showed a very proper spirit to refuse a man cursed with such a father lesser trouble haunted cadworthy for the parent of rupert ned declared himself to be suffering from a great grievance
vivian was an obstinate man and would not yield to his sons demand but the situation rapidly reached a climax for rupert would not yield either
night was the farmers time for long discussions with his wife and there came a moment when he faced the present crisis with her and strove for some solution of the difficulty
yourself and turn out the light and come to bed he said to mrs ned
he already lay in their great and solid though the monster was it when vivians immense bulk turned upon it
his wife soon joined him and then he began to talk
he prided himself especially on his reasonableness after the fashion of unreasonable men
it cant go on and it shant he said
never was heard such a thing as a son defying his father this way
if hed only given the girl up then i should have been the first to relax authority and tell him he might have her in due season if she liked to wait
but for him to cleave to her against my express a very improper and when you take into account what a father ive been to the man
and been a good son too
and why not
i was a good than ever rupert was
and would i have done this
i never thought of marriage till my parents were gone
work was enough for you
and so it should be for every young man
but nowadays they think of nought but revels and outings and the girls
a poor generation
my arm would make a leg for any youth i come across nowadays
you must remember a wonder my dear
we cant all be like you
my own sons ought to be anyway
and ive a right to demand it of em
rupert works as hard as a man can a thousand times than ned
i wont have you name em together he answered
a mans firstborn is always a bit different to the rest
ned is more given to reading and brain work
she laughed fearlessly and he like a bull beside her
what are you laughing at
he said
at your silliness
such a sharp chap and so wise as you are and yet our handsome he cant do wrong
and lord knows he cant do wrong in my eyes neither
still when it comes to work well leave ned answered the father
he can work all right and when youve seed him play and marked his intellects and power of speech youll be the first to say what a deal of cleverness be hid in him
his minds above the land and why not
we cant all be farmers
but ruperts a born farmer and seeing as he be going to follow my calling he ought to follow my example and bide a bachelor for a good ten years more
shes a nice girl however
she may be or she may not be
anyway shes been advising him to go away from home and thats not much to her credit
she loves him and hates for him to be here so miserable
hell find himself a mighty sight more miserable away
dont i pay him good money
bant he saving and prospering
what the deuce do he want to put a wife and children round his neck for till hes learned to keep his own head above water
twas mr man thats determined him i do think declared hester ned
jack is just the sort to unsettle the young with his mischievous ideas
all the same i wish to god you could meet rupert
hes a dear good son and theres lots of room and for my part id love to see him here with milly
tis high time you was a grandfather
you foolish women
let him bide his turn then
the eldest first i say
tis quite in reason that ned with his fashion of mind should take a wife
ive nought against that you silly men
she said
ned
why what sensible girl will look at such a as him
hes too fond of all the girls ever to take one
and if he dont throw them over after a bit of keeping company they throw him over
if you could but see yourself and him
tis as good as
theres only one lazy man in the world that your husband forgives for being lazy said jack to me but yesterday
and who might that be
said i well knowing
why ned of course he answers back
i must talk to jacks master
a lot too free of speech hes because they be going to let him perform the bear at christmas
but when alls said the wise man makes up his own mind and that have been my habit from my youth up
you think so she answered
i know so
and rupert may go
hell soon come back
never master
hell come back i tell you
hell find the outer world very different from cadworthy
i wish youd let that poor boy mark be a lesson to you
your love story ran so you cant think what tis for a young thing to be crossed where the heart is set
it looks a small matter to us as have forgotten the fret and fever if we ever felt it but to them tis life or death
thats all moonshine and storybooks
and my story ran along of my own patience and good other reason
and i may tell you that mark have took the blow in a very sensible spirit
i saw my brother a bit i mean
he was terrible cut up for both of em being as soft as a woman where young people are concerned
but hed had a long talk with mark and found him perfectly patient and resigned about it
the cow forgets her calf
tis the quiet sort that dont make a row and call out their misfortunes in every ear that feel the most
its cut him to the heart and gone far to ruin his what its done
you dont want to have your son in the same case
1 bellowing
ruperts very different to that
tis his will against mine and if he disobeys he must stand the brunt and see what life be like without me behind him
when nathan went for a sailor i said nothing
they couldnt all bide here and twas a manly calling
but rupert was brought up to take my place owing to neds superior brain power and now if hes going to fling off about a girl and defy he may go but they laugh best who laugh last
hell suffer for it
im much feared nought we can do will change him
that girl be everything to him
a terrible pity too for after you i never a man so greedy of work
sundays
there are too many sundays he said to ned in my hearing not long since
what do a healthy man want to waste every seventh day for
it might have been you talking
not at all answered her husband
very far from it
thats jacks impious opinion
who be we to question the lords ordaining
the sevenths the lords and i dont think no better of rupert for saying that hard though it may sometimes be to keep your hands in your pockets especially at hay harvest
well if you bant going to budge hell go
then let him he can tell the people that he havent got no father no more for thats how twill be if he does go
dont you say that master
why for not
truths truth
and now us will go to sleep if you please
soon his mighty snore thundered through the darkness but mrs ned was well seasoned to the sound and thoughts of her son not the noisy repose of her husband banished sleep
others had debated these vexed questions of late and the dark short days were made darker for certain sympathetic people by the troubles of mark and the anxieties of his cousin rupert
nathan ned discussed the situation with mrs cora a week before the great production of st
st_george
matters had now advanced and the situation was developed
that old fool mr_gollop
he said
he now as if the eye of the world was on him
youd think shaugh was the hub of the universe as the yankees say and that thomas was the lynchpin of the wheel
hes found time to see which way the cats jumping all the same answered mrs cora
full of ned and our cora now
says that tis a case and everybody knows it
nathan shrugged his shoulders
these things cant be arranged for them
the young must go their own road
a splendid couple they make without a doubt
theyll look magnificent in their finery at the revel
but i wish nephew ned wasnt quite so vain of his good parts
cora herself entered at this moment and had that to say which awoke no small interest in her mother
ive fallen in with mark she said and i was passing but he spoke and tis all well i believe
he was very quiet and you might almost say cheerful
thank the lord hes got over it then answered nathan but mrs cora doubted
dont feel too sure of that
he bant one to wear his heart on his sleeve anyway
hes took it surprising well everybody says said cora in a voice that made the innkeeper laugh
poor i see cora here isnt too pleased that hes weathered the storm so easily
shed have liked him to be a bit more down in the mouth
im very pleased indeed she answered
you never gave better advice than when you bade me write to him
the truth is that hes not made to marry
tenor bell be enough wife for him
i wonder wholl ring it when youre wedded mused nathan
no man have touched that bell since my nephew took it up
time enough
not that hed mind ringing for me i believe
such a bloodless thing as he is fight in him at all seemingly
if you talk like that we shall begin to think youre sorry he took you at your word said ned but cora protested and when he had gone she spoke more openly to her mother
tis a very merciful escape for me and perhaps for him
i didnt understand my own mind and since hes took it so wonderful cool i guess he didnt know his mind either
you havent heard the last of him
ive met the like
for my part id rather hear he was daft and frantic than so calm and reasonable
tis the sort that keep their trouble out of sight suffer most
id have forgiven him everything but being a coward declared cora fiercely
whats the use of a man that goes under the thumb of his father
if hed said i hate my father and ill never see him again and well run away and be married and teach him a lesson then id have respected him
but not a bit of it
and to take what i wrote like that
not even to try and make me think better of it
a very chap
mrs cora smiled not at the picture of marks sorrows but at her daughters suggestion that she would have run away with the young man and married him and defied consequences
how we fool ourselves she said
you think you would have run with him
you wouldnt have run a yard cora
the moment you found things was contrary with his father you was off
because your first thought always is and always has been the main chance
you meant to marry him for his and me know that very well if none else does
the daughter showed no concern at this attack
i shant marry a pauper certainly
my face is all the fortune you seem like to give me and im not going to fling it away for nought
i do set store by money and i do long to have some and so do every other woman in her senses
the only difference between me and others is that they pretend money bant everything and i say it is and dont pretend different
milly be going to stick to rupert ned however though tis said his father will cut him off with a shilling if he leaves cadworthy
cora sniffed
therell be so much the more for the others then
they ned fathers always seem to stand in the way of their sons when it comes to marrying
nathan would have been different if hed had a family
he understands the young generation
not that vivian ned will object to ned marrying for ned told me so
no doubt hell be glad for ned to be prevented from making a fool of himself any more
mrs coras daughter flushed
hes long ways off a fool she said
he bant the man who comes all through the wood and brings out a crooked stick after all
he knows what women are very well
yes and i suppose mr timothy knows too
hes different to ned
more cautious like and prouder
id sooner have neds vanity than pride
what did he want to be up here talking with you timothy i mean
no matter
farming anyway
might have been or might not
but mark this hes a very shrewd sensible young man and knows his business and how to work and the value of money and what it takes to save money
hell wear all you toss your head
hes a very good chap
ive got nothing against him but but suits you better
well have a care
dont be in no hurry
get to know a bit more about him and be decent cora
be decent by no means to pick up with him while everybody knows youve just jilted his cousin
didnt do no such thing
ive got my side and in you to use such a word as that answered her daughter sharply
however you never did have no sympathy with me and i cant look for it
ill go my way all the same and if some fine day im up in the world ill treat you better than youve treated me
but mrs cora was not impressed by these sentiments
she knew her daughters heart sufficiently well
twill be a pair of you if you take ned she said
and you neednt pretend to be angered with me
you cant help being what you are
im not chiding you im only reminding you that you must be and give matter time to be forgot
you owe the other man something if tis only i mean
hell be comforted mighty quick answered cora
perhaps hell let his father choose the next for him then twill work easier and everybody will be pleased
as for me im in no hurry and you neednt drag in neds name for he havent axed me yet and very like hed get no for his answer if he did
mrs cora prepared to depart and cora spoke again
and as for mark hes all right and up for anything
he chatted free and friendly about the play and the dresses were going to wear
hes to be prompter on the night and tis settled that the schoolmaster from be going to be doctor because theres none in this parish will do it
and mark says that after the plays over he shall very like do the same as rupert and leave home
he said that
yes and i said none can ring tenor bell like you im sure
then he looked at me as if he could have said a lot but he didnt
i hope he will go and see a bit of the world
twill help him to forget you said her mother
neds the only one of em knows the world answered cora
hes travelled about a bit and tis natural that his father should put him before all the others and see his sense and learning
when parsons voice gave out ned read the sunday you was from nobody ever did it better
hes a very clever man in fact and his father knows it and when his father dies the will is going to show what his father thinks of him
hes told you so i suppose
ned has yes
he knows im one of the businesslike sort
id leap the hatch tomorrow if a proper rich man came along and asked me to
remember youre not the all said her mother
if you take him and he changes his mind and serves you like hes served another here and there youll have a very unquiet time of it and look a very big fool
twas all nonsense and lies she answered
he made the truth clear to me
he never took either of them girls
they wasnt nice maidens and they rushed him into thought they had
hes never loved any woman until cora broke off
shant tell you no more she continued
tis no odds to dont care a i shall soon be out of your hawk_house anyhow
perhaps but i shall be a thought sorry for all them at cadworthy if you take ned and set up wife along with his family answered her mother
hard as a you be and youll have em all by the ears so sure as ever you go there
2 kestrel
you ax mrs hester ned if i be hard retorted cora
shell tell that im gentle as a
i dont show my claws without theres a good reason for it
and never unless there is
anyway im a girl thats got to fight my own battles since you take very good care not to do a mothers part and help me
you shall have the last word answered mrs cora
chapter xv some weeks after christmas had passed mr joseph joe_voysey and others met at the white thorn and played chorus to affairs according to their custom
the great subject of discussion was still the play
it had been enacted twice to different audiences and it proved but an indifferent success
everybody agreed that the entertainment promised better than its ultimate performance
at rehearsal all went well upon the night of the display a thousand mishaps combined to lessen its effect
summed up to thomas who sat and drank with him
what with us all being so busy about christmas and the weather and nathan here getting a cold on his chest and only being able to croak like a frog and parson losing his temper with head at the last rehearsal and other things it certainly failed
tis a case of least said mended but im keeping this mask of the french eagle what i wore for it makes a very pretty ornament hanged over my parlour
in my judgment declared nathan twas jack that played the mischief with the show
after parson cooled him down at rehearsal i allow he went a bit lighter on his part and didnt act quite so forcible but well i knew he was saving it up for the night and so he was
twas all jack all the time and even when he was supposed to be dead he must still keep growling to make the people laugh
hes had a right down row with mr dennis since
a sort of man and yet a cheerful man and yet again a very rebellious man against the powers said joe_voysey
well tis over and it shows like everything else do how much may grow out of little added nathan
just a bit of fun at christmas youd say wouldnt leave no very great mark at
its brought the eyes of the county on us as i said it would replied the parish clerk
the rural dean was here afterwards and took his luncheon at the vicarage and came to the church to see the but nancy to the at table and she told my sister that his reverence said to mr dennis that wed fallen between two stools and that the performance was a sort of a mongrel between a modern pantomime and the old miracle play and that the masks and were out of order
and miss dennis was a bit acid with the rural dean and said to his face that if hed only had to see the thing through as they had she was sure that hed be more charitable like about it
us shant have no more mark me foretold then others entered the bar among them being saul_luscombe milly from and heathman cora
the was on his way home and stayed only for a pint and a few friendly words
you should hear jack tell about the play he said
and he should hear us tell about him answered joe_voysey
jack so near as damn it spoilt the play
in fact innkeeper here thinks he did do so
he vows that he saved the whole job from being a failure
and young farmer timothy swears twas miss cora as the princess that saved it and ned your nephew swears twas himself that saved it
and i think twas i that saved it declared thomas
however enough said
tis of the past and will soon be forgot like a dead man out of mind
thats where youre wrong tom said heathman
you cant forget a thing so easy
besides theres all that hangs to it
theres polly ned that was one of coras maidens in the play got engaged to be married on the strength of nick as on the turkish knight
and news still for me and mine
coras taken ned
i knew it was going to happen admitted nathan
tis a very delicate thing for shes only broken with the mans cousin a matter of a few months
her mother asked me about it a bit ago
youve got to remember this said heathman
i should have been the first to make a being coras only brother and the only man responsible to look after her
i say i should have been the first to make a row for i was terrible savage with her and thought it hard for her to throw over mark just because his father was an old
but seeing how mark took it to the eye i grant you that but these quiet chaps as hide their feelings often feel a lot more than they show said mr milly
he was hard hit and well i know it for his father told me so continued nathan ned
my brother humphrey in a sort of way blamed me and mrs cora and in fact everybody but himself
one minute he said that mark was well out of it and the next he got to be very jealous for mark and told me that people were against his son
i go in fear of meeting my brother now for when he hears that cora is going to take ned hell think twas all a plot and hell rage on marks account
tis mark that i fear for said heathman then mr_gollop suddenly stopped him
hush
he cried and held up his hand
after a brief silence however he begged young cora to proceed
beg your pardon he said
i thought i heard something
i fear for mark continued the other because i happen to know that he still secretly hoped a bit
i dont like my sister cora none too well and i reckon marks worth a million of her and i told him i was glad to see him so cheerful about it
very wise to keep up your pecker mark i said to the man because shem not your sort really
i know her better than you do and can testify to it
but he said i mustnt talk so and he told me very private that he hadnt up all hope
poor chap i can let it out now for he knows tis all over now
while shes free theres a chance he told me
i wont never think he said that all thats passed between us is to be blown away at a breath of trouble like this
thats how he put it and i could see by the hollow state of his eyes and his nerves all that hed been through a terrible lot
hed built on her coming round poor
thats why he put such a brave face on it then murmured nathan
then joe_voysey spoke again
as it happens i can tell you the latest thing about him he said
i was to work two days pon the edge of our garden doing nought in particular because the frost was got in the ground and you couldnt put a spade in
but i was busy as a bee according to my up i think twas or setting a or some such who should pass down side of the hedge but mark ned
us fell into talk about the play and i took him down to my hawk_house to show him where my had stuck the mask what made me into the french eagle
then i said there were changes in the air and he said so too
i remarked as rupert ned had left cadworthy and gone to work at the lee moor china clay and he said yes and i be going too
never
i said
whatll mr humphrey do without you
but he didnt know or care
who ever will ring your bell when youre gone
i asked him and thomas again interrupted
tis a terrible queer thing you should name the bell he said for ill take my oath somebodys ringing it now
ringing the bell
what be talking of
asked heathman
why tis hard on ten oclock
yet im right
at this moment saul_luscombe milly who had set out a minute sooner returned
whos ago
he asked
the bells tolling
they crowded to the door stood under the clear stillness of night and heard the bell
at intervals of a minute the deep sonorous note from aloft where the church tower rose against the stars
theres nobody sick to death that i know about said nathan
twill be mark ringing no doubt
none touches tenor bell but him
mr milly remounted his pony
cold bites shrewd after your bar nathan
good night souls
us shall hear who tis tomorrow
the bell tolled thrice more then it stopped
bide a minute and ill come back said
i cant sleep this night without knowing who tis
a very terrible sudden seizure for certain
mr_gollop may know
he crossed the road and entered his own hawk_house which stood against the churchyard wall
they and he returned in a minute
she knows nought he said
mark dropped in a little bit ago and axed for the key
what do e want in belfry now mr
ned
she axed him
passing bell he said and mr_gollop was all of course for twas the first shed heard of it
whats the name
she said but he answered nought and went down the steps and away
a minute after the bell began
tis over now anyway
ill step across and meet mark said ned
one or two others accompanied him but there was no sign of the ringer
then led by mr_gollop they entered the silent church and shouted
where be you mark ned and whos dead
cried mr_gollop
in the belfry profound silence reigned and the ropes hanging from their places above touched the men as they groped in the darkness
hes gone anyway declared nathan
then suddenly a mans boot rubbed against his face
the impact moved it a moment but it swung back heavily again
the innkeeper yelled aloud while mr_gollop fetched a lantern and lighted it
then they found that mark ned had fastened a length of stout cord to the great rope of the tenor bell at twenty feet above the floor
he had mounted a ladder drawn a tight loop round his neck jumped into the air and so destroyed himself
chapter xvi certain human dust lay in a place set apart from the main churchyard of st edwards
here newborn babies that had perished before admission into the christian faith were buried because the ministers of the church felt doubtful as to the of these ones in another world
the spot was known as hill a name descended from ancient use
by were first understood the anointed white garments put upon babes at baptism and afterwards they came to mean the robes of the
infants were also shrouded in them if they perished a month after baptism while a or signified one who thus untimely died
among these fallen buds the late vicar of the parish had also buried a woman who took her own life and thomas nothing doubting but that here and only here the body of mark ned might decently be laid took it upon himself to dig the grave on hill
but the ground was very hard and thomas no longer possessed his strength of arm
therefore a young man helped him and during the intervals of labour the elder related incidents connected with past interments
some belonged to his own recollection others had been handed down by his father
and touching these took off afore the holy water saved em my parent held the old story of the heath hounds concluded thomas
and there might be more in it than us mortals have a right to deny
for my father solemnly swore that hed heard em in winter hurrying through the air for all the world like a flock of birds and barking like in full cry after the
tis satan that keeps em out of the joys of paradise but only for a time you must know because these here never done a stroke of wrong being too young for it and therefore in right and reason they will be up into heaven at the last
but no doubt tis different if a human takes their own life said the young man
different altogether declared
to take your own life be to go to a party afore very and pushing thing to say the least
no charity will cover it
for arguments sake well say as i cut my throat and then i stand afore the throne of grace so soon as the life be out of me
who be you
says the
thomas your reverence says i
then they fetch the books and it all comes out that ive took the law of life into my own hands and upset the record and made a mess of everything because you must know you cant live to yourself alone and if you lay hands on your body you be upsetting other lives beside your own and making trouble in the next world so well as this
so down i go to the bad very well i should deserve it
i cant be sure of dennis but hell hardly have the face to treat this rash corpse like a creature i should hope
the parish will ring with it if he do
sitting now over to the white thorn said toms assistant
yes and since jacks pon the jury therell be no with truth
i hate the man and have little good to say of him as a general thing but theres no nonsense to him and though hes wrong than any chap i know he wont be wrong today for he told me nought would shake him
tis the fashion to say that them that kill themselves be daft
they always bring it in so
why
because the dust shall cheat justice and get so good christian burial as the best among us
but head wont have that
hes all for bringing it in naked suicide without any or hedging
the young man was sane as me and took his life with malice aforethought and so he must lie pon hill with the not along with the certainties
as he spoke somebody approached and nathan ned clad in black stood beside them
i want you mr_gollop he said
who are you digging for here
tis long since hill was opened
for mark ned answered the sexton stoutly
tis here hes earned his place and here hell lie if im anybody
nathan regarded thomas with dislike
so old and so still
he said
im glad youve had your trouble for your pains for you deserve it
poor mark is to be buried with his mother
youd better see about it and pretty quick too
the funerals the day after tomorrow
ill discourse with the reverend dennis answered thomas and ill also hear what the coroner have got to say
youre a nasty old man sometimes mr_gollop and never than today
as to mr dennis you ought to know what stuff hes made of by this time and as for the inquest tis ended
the verdict could only be one thing and we decided right away
what about jack
jacks not a old fool whatever else he may be answered the innkeeper
i convinced him in exactly two minutes that my nephew couldnt have been responsible for what he did
and everybody but a sour and bitter man like you must have known it
poor mark is thrown over by a to blame her either for she had to be true to herself
but still he wont believe that shes not for him though shes put it plain as you please in writing and he goes on hoping and dreaming and building castles in the air
always dreamy and queer at all times he that
then comes the crashing news for him that all is over and the maiden has taken another man
wasnt it enough to upset such a frail fanciful creature
enough and more than enough
he hides his trouble and his brain fails and his heart unseen by any eye
and then what happens
he rings his own
was that the work of a sane man
poor chap
and youd deny him christian burial and cast him here like a dog with the poor unnamed children down under
i blush for you
see to his mothers grave and try and be
tis only charity to suppose the bitter cold weather be curdling your blood
now im off to my brother humphrey to tell him what there is to tell
then nathan buttoned up his coat and turned to the grinning labourer
dont laugh at him he said
be sorry for him
tis no laughing matter
fill up that hole and take down yonder slate at the far end of the ned row and put everything in order
our graves be all brick
he departed and walked off to the vicarage
a difficult task nathan but he courted it in hope of future advantage
he was terribly concerned for his brother and now designed to visit him
as yet humphrey had seen nobody
vivian had called at the day after marks death but mrs susan had told him that her master was out
on inquiries as to his state she had merely replied that he was not ill
he had directed that his sons body should remain at the church and he had not visited shaugh again or seen the dead since the night that mark perished
now nathan secretly hoping that some better understanding between him and humphrey might arise from this shattering grief and himself suffering more than any man knew from the shock of it hastened to visit his bereaved brother and acquaint him with the circumstances of the inquest
humphrey ned was from home and nathan knowing his familiar haunt proceeded to it
but first he asked mrs susan how her master fared
the womans eyes were stained with tears and her nerves
he bears it as only he can bear she said
youd think he was a stone if you didnt know
grinds on with his lord knows at what cost to himself
he lighted his pipe this morning
it went out again i grant you still it shows the nature of him that he could light it
not a word will he say about our dear blessed to what i call that bitch to
you mustnt talk like that susan
twas not the girls fault but her cruel misfortune
be honest theres a good creature
shes suffered more than any but her mother knows
no no cora
the terrible truth is that humphreys self is responsible for all
if hed met mrs coras daughter in a kinder spirit shed never have feared to come into the family and never have thrown over poor mark
but he terrified her to death nearly and she felt a marriage with such a mans son could never come to good
mrs susan was not following the argument
her mind had suffered a deep excitation and shock and she wandered from the present to the past
the ups and downs of itthe riddle of itthe indecency of in general i mean
to think that me and you not above a week were dancing afore the public christmas and mother dorothy
how the people laughed
and now she stared stupidly before her and suddenly began repeating her part in the play
here come i old mother dorothy fat fair plump and commodity
my head is big my body is bigger dont you think i be a handsome old figure
and the quality said i might have been made for the part
youre along of all this cruel grief answered nathan
go in out of this cold wind susan and drink a stiff drop of spirits
i suppose my brother is up on the tor
yes hes up there you can see him from the back garden
looks like an stone among the stones or a crow among the crows
but the fires within
he was terrible fond of mark really though hed rather have had pincers nip him than show it
ill go up declared the innkeeper
he climbed where his brother appeared against the skyline and found humphrey poised standing on a stone and looking into the eye of the east wind
his coat was flapping behind him his hat was drawn over his eyes his nose was red and a drop hung from it
he looked like some great forlorn fowl perched desolate and starving here
forgive me for coming brother but i hadnt the heart to keep away
you wouldnt see me before but you must now
get down to the lew side of these stones
i must speak to you
im trying to understand answered the other calmly
and the east winds more like to talk sense to me than ever you will
dont say that
we often court physical trouble ourselves when we are driven frantic with mental trouble
i know that
ive suffered too in my time though maybe none of the ever know how much
but tis senseless to risk your own life here and fling open your lungs to the east wind because your dear son has gone
remember tis no great ill to die humphrey
then why do you ask me to be thoughtful to live
i mean we mustnt mourn over mark for his loss for ourselves
hes out of it
no more east wind for him
tis our grief thats left
his griefs done his cares be vanished for ever
you mustnt despair humphrey
and you pass for an understanding man i suppose
and tell me not to despair
despairs childish
only children despair when they break their toys
and grownup children too
but not me
i never despair because i never hope
i made him
i created him
he was a good son to me
and a good man every way
gentle and gentle and kind for that matter
thank god were all christians
blessed are the meek
his cup of joy is full and where he is now humphrey his only grief is to see ours
thats the sort of stuff thats got you a great name for a sympathetic and feeling man i suppose
mean it or is it just the natural flow of words as the rain falls and the water rolls downhill
i tell you that he was a good man and a man to make others happy in his mild humble way
feeble you might call him here and there
and his ended him
too feeble to face life without that heartless baggage
leave her alone
you dont understand that side and this isnt the time to try and make you
shes hit hard enough
humphrey regarded his brother with a blazing glance of rage
then his features relaxed and he smiled strangely at his own heart but not at nathan
i was forgetting he said
then he relapsed into silence
presently he spoke again
my mark wasnt much more than a picture hung on a wall to some people
perhaps he wasnt much more to me
but you miss the picture if tis taken down
i never thought of such a thing happening
i didnt know or guess all that was hidden bottled up in him
i thought he was getting over it but he couldnt think shed really gone
then woman herself i it into him that there was no more hope and then he took himself off like this
for such a worthless think
and i suppose shell hear his bell next sunday without turning a hair
dont say that
shes terribly cut up and distressed
and im sure will ever listen to his bell like we used to
twill always have a sad message for everybody that knew mark
humbug and trash
youll be the first to laugh and crack your jokes and all the rest of it the day that girl marries
and the bell clashing overhead and the ashes of him in the ground under
let me choose the me choose the man when she takes a husband
nathan perceived that his brother did not know the truth
it was no moment to speak of cora and ned however
ive just come from the inquest he said
of course twas brought in unsound mind
of of seeing and owning that the only flash of sanity in many a life be the resolve and deed to leave it
he was sane enough
no ned was ever otherwise
tis only us old fools that stop here fumbling at the knot that be mad
the big spirits cant wait to be troubled for years and ten with a cargo of stinking flesh
they drop it overboard and his foot slipped and interrupted the sentence
take my arm said the innkeeper
ive told mr_gollop that mark will lie with his mother
the other seemed suddenly moved by this news
if ive misjudged you nathan im sorry for it he said
you know in your heart whether youre as good as the folk think and as wise and as worthy
but you catch me short of sleep today and when im short of sleep im short of sense perhaps
to lie with his
no new thing if he does
he lay many a night under her bosom afore he was born and many a night on it afterwards
she was wonderful wrapped up in only thing she fretted to leave
how she would him for pure animal love when he was a a cat and her kitten
he promised her when he was ten years year she he would be buried with her said nathan
i happen to know that humphrey
few keep their promises to the dead but hes dead himself now
burrow down to her and put him there beside to dust
i take no stock in dust of any being a farmer
but his mother earned heaven and if he didnt her tears may float him in
to have bred an immortal soul mark you is something even if it gets itself damned
the parent of a human creature be like god for hes had a hand in the making of an angel or a devil
shall we bring mark back tonight or shall the funeral start from the church
asked nathan
they had now descended the hill and stood at humphreys gate
dont worry his bones
let him stop where he is till his beds ready
im not coming to the funeral
not coming
no
i didnt go to my wifes did i
yes indeed you did humphrey
youre wrong there
a black hat with a weeper on it and a coat and a mourning was me
bury him and toll his own bell for him but for gods sake dont let any useful person catch their death of cold for him
me and his motherwell mourn after our own fashion
yes her too there are spirits moving here for the minute
in his empty room she was the night he finished it
feeling about she was as if shed lost a threepenny piece in the
i heard her
let be
i shouted from my chamber
the mans not there hes for love in the belfry
go back where you come from
hell be there afore you and if not theyll tell you where to seek him
he turned abruptly and went in then as his brother dazed and bewildered was about to hurry homeward the elder again emerged and called to him
a word for your ear alone he said as nathan returned
theres not much love lost between us and never can be but i thank you for coming to me today
i know you meant to do a kindly thing
my trouble hasnt blinded me
trouble bant meant to do that
tears have washed many eyes into clear seeing as never saw straight afore they shed em
im obliged to you
youve come to me in trouble though well you know i dont like you
twas a christian thing and i shant forget it of you
if ever you fall into trouble yourself come to me innkeeper
twas worth my pains to hear that
god support you always brother
but humphrey had departed
nathan drifted back and turned instinctively to rather than his own hawk_house
darkness and concern homed there also cora had gone away to friends far from the village and the coras all wore mourning for mark
priscilla met her landlord and he came into the kitchen and flung his hat on the table and sat down to warm himself by the fire
god knows whats going to happen he said
the mans mind is tottering
never such sense and nonsense was jumbled in a breath
after a pause he spoke again
and poor old susans half mad too
an awful hawk_house of it
nothing humphrey may do will surprise me
but one blessed word he said poor chap though whether he knew what he was talking about i cant guess
he thanked me for coming to him in me even gratefully and said hed never forget it
that was a blessed thing for me to hear at such a time
the emotional man shed tears and priscilla cora ministered to him
chapter xvii humphrey ned had sought for peace by many roads and when the final large catastrophe of his life fell upon him it found him treading a familiar path
he had conceived that only by limiting the ties of the flesh and trampling love of man from his heart might one approximate to contentment fearlessness and rest
he had supposed that the fewer we love the less life has power to torment us and he had envied the passionless sunless serenity of recorded philosophers and saints
he was glad that at a time when nature has a large voice in the affairs of the individual and sways him through sense he had not incurred the customary responsibilities
chance threw him but a single child and when the mother of the child was taken from him he felt a sort of dreary satisfaction that fate could only strike one more vital blow
he had dwarfed his affections obstinately he had estimated the power of life to inflict further master sorrows and imagined that by the death of one human creature alone could added suffering come
so at least he believed before the event
and now that creature was actually dead
out of the ranks of man the bullet had found and slain his son
yet when mark sank to the grave and the first storm of his passing was stilled in the fathers heart great new facts and information until then denied fell upon humphrey neds darkness and showed him that even this stroke could not sever his spirit from its kind
the deliverance did not descend upon him the universal indifference did not come
instead his unrest persisted and he found the fabric of his former dream as baseless as all dreaming
because the alleged saint and the detached philosopher are forms that mask reality they are poses only possible where the soul suffers from constitutional atrophy or incurred frostbite
they who stand by the wayside and watch are freezing to death instead of burning healthily away
faulty sentience is not sublime to be gelded of some natural human instinct is not to stand upon the heights
he who lifts a barrier between himself and life shall be found no more than an unfinished thing
his ambition for detachment is the craving of disease his content is the content of unconsciousness his peace is the peace of the mentally infirm
a complete man feels a complete man suffers with all his tingling senses a complete man smarts to see the worlds brutalities he endures them as wrongs to himself and because he is a complete man he too blunders and adds his errors to the sum of human tribulation even while he fights with all his power for the increase of human happiness
the worlds welfare is his own its griefs are also his
he errs and makes atonement he achieves and helps others to achieve he loathes the cloister and loves the hearth
he suffers when society is stricken he mourns when the tide of evolution seems to rest from its eternal task of pure ablution round earths human shores he is troubled when transitory victories fall to evil or ignorance in fine he lives
and his watchtower and beacon is not content not peace but truth
he stands as high above the cowardly serenity of any anchorite or chambered thinker as the star above glimmering and rotten wood in a forest hidden and he knows that no great heart is ever passionless or serene or beyond the cry of little hearts until it has begun to grow cold
to be holy to yourself alone is to be nought a piece of marble makes a better saint and he who quits the arena to look on though he may be as wise as the watching gods is also as useless
dimly out of the cloud of misery that fell upon him when his son perished ned began to perceive and to feel these facts
he had consoled himself by thinking that the only two beings he loved in the whole world were gone out of it and now together in eternity for his own arrival thither
their battle was ended and since they were at rest nothing further remained for him to trouble about
but the anticipated peace did not appear no anodyne poured into his soul and he discovered that for his nature the isolated mental standpoint did not exist
there could arise no healing epiphany of mental indifference for him
he might be estranged but to exile himself was impossible
he must always actively hate what he conceived to be evil he must always suspect human motives he must always feel the flow and ebb of the human tide
though his own rocky heart might be lifted above them the waves of that sea would tune its substance to throb in sympathy or fret it to beat with antagonism so long as it pulsed at all
this discovery surprised the man for he had believed that a radical neutrality to human affairs belonged to him
he attributed the sustained restlessness of his spirit to recent griefs and supposed that the storm would presently disappear and meantime he plunged into a minor whirlwind by falling into the bitterest quarrel with his elder brother
nathan indeed he had suffered to depart in peace but as soon as the bereaved father learned that vivians son ned was engaged to cora and perceived how it was this fact that had finally killed hope in mark and induced the unhappy weakling to destroy himself his rage burst forth against the master of cadworthy and when vivian called upon the evening of the funeral to with humphrey an enduring strife sprang up between them
im come as the head of the family humphrey began the veteran and it bant that this here terrible day should pass over your head without any of your kith and kin speaking to you and comforting you
we laid the poor young man along with his mother in the second row of the ned stones
my word
as mr_gollop said after the funeral even in death the neds be a pushing family
our slates stretch pretty near from the church to the churchyard wall now
thank you for being there answered his brother
i couldnt have gone because of the people
there was no maiming of the
not a word left as it should be
eight young men carried him including a farmer or two and my son ned and heathman cora and also my son where he came from and where he went to after twas ended i dont know and dont care
hes left meto better he thinks poor fool
a nice way to treat a good father
youve lost a son too him to find him again doing mans work
youll live to know that he was right and you were wrong
but my mind is turned rather rotten of late
after dark i cant get his dead face out of my eyes
nought terrible in a word dead
he broke his didnt strangle himself
he knew what he was about
but there i see it
none knows what he was to me
he never knew himself and for that matter i never knew myself he was gone
we never do know all other folk mean to until they be snatched off
if anybody had told me how my son ruperts going would have made such a difference id not have believed it
then think of this hawk_house
you feel with your store of children and rupert after all but gone a few miles away to go on with his work and marry the proper wife you deny him
but but good morning father no good night father no ear to listen no voice to ask for my advice
and id plotted and planned for him vivian id made half a hundred little secret plans for him
i knew well the gentle fashion of man he likely ever to make a so id cast his life in a mould where it could be easy
hed have come to know in time
but he never did know
he went out of it in a hurry and never hinted a whisper of what he was going to do
if hed but given me the chance to argue it out with him
weve acted alike me and you answered his brother and it bant for any man to dare to say that either of us was wrong
when the young fall into error tis our duty to speak and save em if weve got the power
i dont hold with rupert no need to drag in your affairs
that case is very different
i did not treat my son like a child i did not forbid him to marry and turn him out of doors
stay
cried vivian growing red you mustnt speak so to me
what did you do if it wasnt that
no proud man can stay under the roof where hes treated like a child
but i forbid
no
i only made it clear that i despised the woman hed set his heart on
i only told him the bitter truth of her
if shed clung to him through all would i have turned him away or refused him
never
have made no difference
twas not me kept em you are trying to keep apart your son and saul_luscombe and failing
twas the proud empty heartless female herself that left him
ill hear nought against her answered vivian stoutly
shes not proud and shes not empty
shes a very sensible woman and this cruel piece of work has been a sad trouble to her
she left mark because she felt that you hated her and would torment her and make her married life a scourge to her back
any woman with proper sense and would have done the like
twas you and only you choked her off your son and tis wicked to the say now that twas her fault
but ive not come to speak these i wont hear lies told
youve heard em already it seems
whos been telling you this trash
nathan ned
as a matter of fact tis my son ned answered vivian
you must surely know how things have fallen out
it happened long afore poor mark died
didnt he tell you
he told me nought
what should he tell me
ned he certainly wouldnt name for he knew of all your brood i like your eldest son lazy worthless man as all the world well knows but you
you shant anger me try as you will humphrey
im here as your elder brother and the head of the family to offer sympathy to you in your trouble and ill ax you to leave my family alone
young men will be young men and as for ned if i be the only one that feels as i should feel to him tis because im the only one that understands his nature and his gifts
hell astonish you yet and all of us
the books he reads
you wait
soon ripe soon rotten
hes taking his time and if he wants a wife tis only in reason that the future head of the family should have a wife and why not
he shant have to work as i have worked
a fools word
what made you all you are
work and the love of it
yet you let him go to the devil in idleness
if youd but suffer me to finish my say that ned wont work as i have my limbs and muscles
hes got a brain and the time be coming when hell use it
never
anyway a settled life is the first thing and the mind free to follow its proper bent
and i dont say no to his marrying because the case is different from ruperts and tis fitting that he should do so
but rupert must not
and you pass for a just and sensible man
tis in the ned character that draws so it is continued the master of cadworthy ignoring his brothers last remark
in a word when he found she was free my ned took up with cora and shes going to marry him
but tis to be a full year from this sad bargained for that and will have it so
going to take him
going to take your son
cried the other
she is and i sanction it for i found her a very different maiden to what you did
going to marry ned
going from my mark to your ned
twas settled some time ago
mark knew it for i myself let it out to him when i met him one day in north wood
twas but two days afore his last breath poor fellow
of course i thought that he knew all about it and as it was understood that he had got over his loss very bravely and was cheerful and happy as usual again i made nothing of the matter thinking that was the best way to take it
humphrey stared at him
go letting in the light he said
thats save this
when i told mark that cora was going to wed his cousin i saw by his face twas news for him
his colour faded away
then i knew that he hadnt heard about it
accident had kept it from him till the matter was a week old
and he said
he just said something stammering like
he was a bit of a in his speech to name but it would overtake him now and again if he was very much excited
i didnt catch just what the words about one of the family having her i think twas
then he went and killed himself and not till then
so twas your son after all as settled roar me down for ill be heard
your his work
he plotted and planned it
and lazy i thought him
and i might have known theres no such thing as laziness of mind and body both
busy as a bee damning himself i tell you
a shifty traitor a man to stab other men in the back a knave and the vilest thing that ever bore our name
and you know know it as well as i do
by god
this is too much shouted out vivian rising to his feet and towering over the crouching figure opposite him
what are you made of to say such vile things of an innocent man
you see life all awry you see i see a blind old fool answered the other
you let your wretched son rob you of justice and reason and sense and everything
get hence
ill have no more of you
but your time will come youll suffer yet and this godless useless murder you yourself maybe or murder your love of living at the least
wait and watch him a little longer
hell bring your grey hairs with sorrow to the grave afore hes done with my word for that
and as for me ill curse him to his dying day and curse you for breeding him
wait and watch what youve done and the fashion of man youve let loose on the world and let them sooner the his punishments brewed and theres no escape from the drinking
yes let him eat and drink of her for mans hate cant wish him a worse meal than that
he ceased because he was alone
vivian had felt a terrible danger threatening him and had fled from it
my anger heaved up like seven devils in me he told his wife afterwards
if id a moment longer i must have struck the man
so i just turned tail and bolted afore the harm was done
not but what harm enough be done
he was by the froth on his lip and the light in his eye and them awful eyebrows twitching like an angry apes
twas more a wild beast in a tantrum than a human
tis all over and no fault of mine
ill never speak to horrible creature no more so long as i
and ill not willingly so much as set eyes upon him again
a very pharaoh of a man no doubt declared mrs ned
the lord has hardened his heart against us but hell soften it in his own good time
though for that matter tis difficult to see how he can be struck again
his all be took from him
vivian considered this saying but it did not shake his intention
hes dangerous and desperate and twill be wiser that i see him no more he answered
hes flung my sympathy back in my face and thats a sort of blow leaves a bruise that a long lifes self cant medicine
twill come right
time will heal it she told him
but he was doubtful
there may not be time he said
the man wont live long at the gait hes away with misery he is
and calls himself a christian
little enough comfort the poor soul sucks out of christ
within a week of this incident humphrey ned was seeking his brothers society thing of all others least likely to have happened
it fell out that he was walking as usual on the waste above when he saw his nephew rupert proceeding hastily along the distant road to cadworthy
the young man noted him left his way and approached
tis well i met you uncle he said
young humphreys just ridden over to you with a message from mother
then he came on to me
theres terrible trouble at i mean
you know what he is for doing heavy beyond his years of course
he was shifting grain from the loft and they found him fallen and insensible with a sack on top of him
i hope to god it bant very bad
mother sent off for me for fear it might be a fatal thing
and humphrey says my name was on fathers lips when they laid him to bed after doctor had gone
he said this be ruperts fault
i be driven to this heavy work along of him leaving me and now hes killed me
im sure i hope hell call that back for tis a terrible thing for me to live under if he died
ill come along with you said ned and as to what your father may have spoken in his anger at being stricken down pay no heed to it
hes like a silly boy over these feats of strength and hed have shifted the sacks just the same if youd been there
the thing he said isnt true and theres an end on it
hell be sorry he uttered the word when hes better
they hurried forward and presently stood at the door of cadworthy
youd best knock afore you enter said the elder
were both in disgrace here and come as strangers
i had a difference with your father last time we met
ned is to that woman that killed mark
i could not hear and keep dumb
i cursed my brother in my rage and i owe him an apology
rupert knocked at the door and his sister may answered it
her eyelids were red with tears and her manner agitated
hows your father
asked humphrey
very bad uncle
tis a great doubt if hell get better doctor says
then be sure he will
ive come to see him
mrs ned appeared behind may
she was very pale but appeared collected
im sorry she said
ive told dear master that id sent for rupert and for you humphrey but he wont see neither of you
tis no good arguing about it in his state but i pray god hell change his mind tomorrow
rupert kissed his mother
bear up he said
with his strength and great courage hell weather it please god
you know where i five mile away
ill come running the moment hell see me
and ask him to forgive his brother
im sorry i said the things i did declared humphrey ned
a pony cart drove up at this moment and mr_gollop mr_gollop alighted from it
she carried a large parcel and a corded box was lifted out after her
ive come she said
doctor left a message for me as he went back along and i was ready as usual
hows the poor man going on
im afraid you must not be very doctor said on his way back but where theres life and me theres always hope as my brother thomas will have it
humphrey and his nephew walked slowly away together
at the confines of the farmyard rupert turned out of the road a little and pointed upwards to a window that faced the east
a white blind was drawn down over it
thats fathers room he said
chapter xviii jack entered the bar of the white thorn and was glad to find nathan ned at home
i dont want to drink i want to talk he said
then come into my room jack answered the innkeeper and mr_head followed him into a little chamber known as mr
nathans office
ive got together another five pounds explained the labourer and i know youll do for me what you do for it by with the rest
we come to you ned and we trust you with our savings for why
because you bant a lawyer
youre the poor mans bank as i always say and i only hope you get your fair share of good for all the money you put away to goody for us
thats all right jack
nathan produced a ledger and turned over the pages
this makes twenty to you and interest
he wrote a receipt and handed it to the other
wish id got your head for figures and so i should if id been properly
i shall have some pretty big money on my hands before long im afraid said nathan
doctor called coming back from cadworthy
tis all over with my poor brother im afraid
my mighty man to drop amongst us
well hes had a good life and full share of fortune
his own folly has finished him the worst of it
would be doing the young mens work and did it once too often
a fall so they say
but none appear to know the rights seemingly
simple enough
vivian was carrying oats and slipped his foot on a frosty place
down he came with the sack on his back
he went insensible but by the time young humphrey who was along with him had fetched help vivian had come to again
he crept in the hawk_house and up to his bed
tis nought he told em just a shake up ill be right in the morning
but he wasnt
he couldnt rise and felt a lot of pain to the inwards
doctor wont be sure whats gone but he reckons that the poor mans ruptured spleen or liver
anyway hes going
fading out suffering too
such a mountain as him
i suppose they cant reach the evil
and will all his affairs come down on your shoulders
that is so
everything will have to be done by me
the boys know nought of business
hes a rich mani know that
a great responsibility but no doubt youre up to it
not that it will be so difficult either added nathan because all his money was invested pretty much as i advised
his wife is joint executor with me but she knows nothing
i could have wished hed drawn my brother humphrey in and made him responsible but he never was sure of humphrey im sorry to say and as bad luck would have it just before vivian met with this trouble he had a terrible quarrel with terrible in fact that when humphrey called after the accident farmer wouldnt see him
nor his son neither
i took hope from that for if a mans well enough to keep up such a hatred against his own kin it looks as if he was likely to get better
im afraid not
im going over this afternoon to see him and hear about his will
please god hell prove softer
be a cruel thing if he clouded his great name for justice at the end by striking from the grave
where should he strike
rupert i mean
he took ruperts going terrible to heart and when rupert wrote very properly last christmas and offered his father his respects and said as he meant to marry saul_luscombe niece next spring hester tells me that my brother pretty well threw the doors out of windows
he went to tavistock next day and theres an ugly fear in his wifes mind that he had his will out and tinkered it
i shall ax him this evening and try to get him to see sense
elsewhere hester ned spoke with her husband and found that he already knew what the doctor had advised her to tell him
you can spare speech he said i saw it in the mans eyes and i knew it afore he came for that matter
im not going to get better
im going to die
theres hope still but not enough to im going to die
wheres mr_gollop mr_gollop
ill call her
youd best to hot up the milk he ordered
ill try to let it down if i can
and give mr_gollop pen ink and paper
dont be writing
lie still and let her read to you
you neednt be afraid
my writing was done to tavistock afore i came to grief
youre all right and all that have treated me as a father should be treated are all right
theres tons of money
wheres ned to
hes going to ride in to the surgery for the medicine to stop that cruel pain
let humphrey get it
and send ned to me instead of mr_gollop mr_gollop
tis him i her
she pressed his hand and kissed him and went out
the huge form lay still breathing slowly
a fly out of hibernation by the heat of the fire buzzed about his face
he swore and his scarlet nightcap bobbed as he moved painfully
ned came in little liking to be there
he lacked the spirit and mental courage for such a time
kill this blasted fly will e
then get pen and ink
tis a very old custom in our race ned to write our own epitaphs when we can
ive put mine off and off along of a silly fancy about doing it but the time be ripe and my heads clear
dont say things like that father
you may get better yet
hes going to fetch another doctor tomorrow
let him fetch can do nought
tis the last that none ever stand against
i dont grumble
im only sorry that twas my own son has struck his father
death dont matter but tis a bitter death to know the fruit of your loins his work i was doing let him know work
an old man doing a young mans work
if rupert had been here hed have been shifting they sacks
let none deny it
tis solemn truth
ned knew the extreme falsity of this impression but he made no effort to contradict his father
what i done to tavistock a month i might have undone afore i went continued the sick man
but not when i remember twas his wickedness has hurried me into my grave
where be my son nathans ship to now
dont know father
you ought to know then
him that i would see i cant see and him that would see me i wont see
you might see him father for his peace
peace
damn his peace
what peace shall he have that killed his own father
he dont deserve to look upon me again and he nor that
tell your mother that when im dead rupert bant to see me
only the coffin lid shall he see
the old man and groaned
then he spoke again
have you got pen and ink ready
yes father
turn to the first leaf of the bible then and see my date
ned opened the family register and read the time of his fathers birth
born june died just over the allotted span
let me see how shall the stone read
theres good things on the ned stones
sacred to the memory of vivian ned of cadworthy in this parish yeoman
you can begin like that
shall you say anything about being champion of the west country at wrestling
asked ned
no
that bant a thing for the least perhaps it might be
your uncle the great had a fiddle cut pon his stone very clever
if twas thought that the silver belt could be copied upon my slate but no let that pass tis but a small matter
better leave it to us to think about
nathan will know best
so he will then
and we must work in a rhyme for certain but first ive got a fine thought to put down
ned pen in hand then his father continued to dictate what it pleased the great i letters for i it pleased the great i am to give me in shape of a body in eighteen hundred and eighteen it likewise pleased him to call home again in eighteen hundred and
how does that sound
splendid father
now theres the rhyme to follow
i want to work in breath and death if it can be done
you ought to be able to do it seeing all the learning youve had and what it cost
ned frowned and puzzled
then while vivian groaned he had an inspiration and wrote rapidly
hows this father
he asked
it just flashed in my mind
then he read three score years and ten i kept my breath so long i felt no fear of death
it goes very well but i havent got no more fear of death now than ever i had
you must alter that
silence fell again and ned mended his rhyme
how would this answer
he asked three score years and ten i kept my breath and stood up like a man and feared not death
yes thats very good indeed
now us must make two more lines to is if we can be clever enough to think of em
neds pen squeaked and stopped squeaked and stopped again
he scratched out and wrote for several minutes
listen to this father he said at length tis better even than the first
he read once more yet now im gone my thread is spun and i know my god will say well done
the cleverness of it
and didnt i always say you were crammed up with cleverness
but the last line wont do
tis the best of all father
wont do i tell you
who be i to know my god will pat me on the back
little enough to be pleased enough
put i hope my god will say well done
you may only hope but all else know that he will declared ned stoutly
as he finished writing nathan ned entered with the wife of the sufferer
hester brought a cup of hot milk but vivian in his excitement would not taste until the epitaph had been rehearsed
neds thought he said
and i helped him
and i shall be proud to lie under man might
give me the paper
his son handed it to him and he read the rhyme aloud with great satisfaction
three score years and ten i kept my breath and stood up like a man and feared not death yet now im gone my thread is spun and i hope my god will say well done
hows that nat
so good as the own in my judgment
splendid
splendid
declared nathan
he was much moved
he blew his nose and went to the window awhile
then vivian being relieved and fed the innkeeper returned to him and sat beside him
hester ned and her son went out and left the brothers together
talk business nat said the sick man presently
and first i want you to know that youll have more than your trouble for your pains
tis a common thing with dying people to leave a lot of work behind em for somebody to do and never a penny piece of payment for doing it
but not me
theres fifty pound for you nat
ive in reason all my life
ive he was stopped by pain
bant far off i reckon
cant talk much more
youll do all right and proper
i trust my widow and to you
my boy ned be no good at figures so i look to you
to the very best of my power ill do by them all
leave that now
youre the sort who isnt taken unprepared
i want to say a word about rupert if youll let me
not a a breath
that book is closed not to be opened no more
you dont want to add another pang to my end do you
let me forget him
ive forgiven enough
to forgive him my dear vivian if you have cut him off with nought
ill hear no more
cried the other
ill think no more of him nor yet of humphrey
tis they have cruelly and wickedly wronged me
tis rupert have brought me here and hastened me into my grave ten years afore the time and hell have to answer to his god for it
leave it it and talk of other things
youll like ned to take cora
youll like that
and i shall do something for cora
im very fond of her
they talked for half an hour
then vivian cried out for his wife and nathan left him
that evening dennis dennis came to see the farmer and on the following day he called again
none knew what passed between them but it seemed that by some happy inspiration the clergyman achieved what vivian neds wife and brother had failed to do
dennis had heard from the master of the white thorn that the sick man was passing at enmity with his brother and with his son but he strove successfully against this determination and before he left cadworthy vivian agreed to see his relations
the day was already waning when ned himself rode to fetch rupert and the lad humphrey hastened to
mr_gollop mr_gollop told the sequel to her brother afterwards
it got to be a race towards the end for the poor man fell away all of a sudden after three oclock
nature out as it will sometimes like a candle
hed forgot all about everything afore he died
only his grave stuck in his mind and i read over the epitaph till i was weary of it
then he went frightened all of a sudden
to think o me lying there alone among dead folk of evenings wi nought but the squeaking over the graves he said
you wont be there my dear i told him
youll be up where theres no sun nor yet moon bathing for evermore in the light of righteousness
then he and he and wandered in his speech and the last words i could catch was whats all this pucker about
i shall be my own man again in a day or two
he was and his nose so sharp as a cobblers awl poor dear and i hed soon be out of his misery
his wife was along with him when he died her and the two daughters and poor i call her for she let me use the christian name without a was cut in half listening to his o one side and hoping to hear her son rupert gallop up pon the other
twas a race as i say but rupert had been long ways off to work and ned had to find him and what with one thing and another his father had been out of the world twenty good minutes afore he came
he up the stairs white from the
but there was only more clay on the bed to welcome him
i left em at that sacred moment as my custom is and went down hawk_house and was just in time to see humphrey ned ride up in hot haste on his pony
how is it with him
he said getting off very spry
i hope as he could send for me that he finds better
not at all i answered him
the poor man sent because he was worse and felt himself slipping away
then id best be quick he replied to me and i broke it to him that twas too late
hes gone sir i said
like the dew upon the fleece he be gone
half an hour ago he died and suffered very little at the end so far as a mortal but experienced woman can tell you
he stared slap through me in that awful way he has then he turned his back and got up on his beast and rode off without a word or a sign
lord he knows what that old pony must have thought of it all
twas sweating and staggering and no doubt full of wonder and rage at being pushed along so fast
1 bats
end of first book book ii chapter i upon the highway between cadworthy and the border village of there stands an ancient granite cross
for many years the broken head reposed in the heather then it was lifted upon the pedestal again and the vanished shaft restored
to north and south the white road sweeps by it easterly tower and pen beacon and westerly rolls shaugh moor
here upon a day one year after the death of vivian ned there met two of his sons and the conversation that took place between them served roughly to record the development of their affairs together with the present situation and future interests of the family
ned was riding home from and his brother rupert knowing that he must come this way sat by st cross smoked his pipe and
the younger had found himself forgotten when his fathers will came to be read
it was a pious fiction with hester ned that her husband had striven when too late against his own hasty deed
she believed that near his end the dying man attempted to repair this wrong
she declared that his eyes and his both spoke to that effect
but the fact of was all that remained for rupert to face and in his bitterness he had turned from his family and continued to toil at the works despite his mothers entreaties and neds handsome propositions
now however the case was altered
after nine months of this milly prevailed with rupert to go back to cadworthy and take her with him
his mother was thankful to welcome him home and ned did what he might to further the prospect
rupert stood within sight of marriage and he and his wife were presently to dwell at cadworthy
then control of the farm would be made over by ned to his brother
now rupert in working clothes sat by the cross
opportunity to see ned was not always easy for the elder lived a life of pure pleasure and occupied much of his time from home
he was only concerned to spend money but showed no interest in the sciences of administering and making it
he rode up presently stopped and bending over shook hands with his brother but did not dismount

dont often see you smoking and taking your ease
look at my new mare
isnt she a beauty
but lord knows what nathan will say when i come down upon him for the cash
and ive got another unpleasant surprise in store for him
ive bought a horse for cora
itll be my to her but she may as well have it now
pity we couldnt have all been married together then one fuss and flare up and expense would have done for the lot of us
i shouldnt have minded but she didnt take to the idea at all
wants to have a wedding all to herself
and about time too
im sick of waiting
as a matter of fact ned had found no difficulty in suspense
with possession of money lifes boundaries considerably enlarged for him and he became a person of increased importance
cora was not jealous and finding ned extremely generous she continued content with the engagement
the present year was to see her married however but when nathan ned suggested a triple wedding cora objected very strongly
she intended that her nuptials should be in a style considerably grander than those of milly or polly ned but she finally promised ned to marry him during the following autumn
a nice mare admitted rupert shes got a temper carry beer
i know the man who used to own her
she very near broke his neck for him the night after revel
the horse isnt foaled that will ever throw me i believe
i reckon not
well im here to meet you ned
i want to run over the ground
you hate business so bad that tis difficult to talk about it with you but all the same as a man with money you must think a bit
nathan thinks for me
he was paid to
didnt father leave him fifty pounds to be trustee or whatever tis
but you never will look ahead
nathan since that bad bout of health last winter isnt what he was
clever enough i grant but he has got his own affairs and his own worries too for that matter
everything be safe and proper in his hands but suppose he fell ill
suppose he was to die
youre such a beggar for supposing
never meet troubles my rule and ive found it work very well too
i trust nathan like the rest of the world trusts him
i sign his blessed papers and i get my quarters allowance very regular with a bit of money over and above when i want it though he
i ask for no more but to be allowed to enjoy life as long as i can
im going to do this anyway said rupert
ill tell you my hopes and plans
tis right and wise to make plans and look ahead and set yourself a task
and my task be to get cadworthy away from you for my own in twenty years from the time i go there
i shant sure of that
likely id make hard terms with my own brother
you go in as my tenant at just what rent you please to pay in reason and you pay me as much over and above the rent as you can afford till the price of the farm is polished off
and mother stops with you and may stops with you
mother has her allowance and may has hers so theyll be no charge on you
and i stop im married
thats all clear then
yes and what im going to do is this
it seems there are things called sleeping convenient things too
all you do is to find a good safe established business that wants a bit of cash
and you put your cash in and just go to the business once in a blue moon and sign your name in a book or two and draw your fees and there you are
nathans on the lookout for some such a thing for a bit of my money
and i hope it will be in plymouth for choice because coras frightfully keen to be near plymouth
she wants to make some decent woman pals naturally
its ridiculous such a girl messing about in a hole like shaugh
she hinted at a shop but i wont have that for a moment
all the same i dont see why you shouldnt try and look out for something that would give you a bit of work
work wont hurt her or you
you must be pretty well sick of doing nothing by this time i should think
far from it declared ned
i find myself quite contented
i shall turn my hand to work presently
no hurry that i can see
im learning a lot remember that
a great learner i am
the first use of money is to learn the world rupert
thats where that old fool at has messed up his life
no better than a miser that man
a spendthrift may be a fool but a miser always is
and so it comes back to the fact that uncle humphreys a fool as i always said he wasa fool and a beast both
hes different enough from nathan i grant be soft or gentle but hes no fool and though he pretends hes not interested in people he is
things slip out
look how he reads the newspapers
yet now for very hatred of all human cant be for anything rumoured hell leave and get away from the sight of roads even
susan told mother not a week that he was getting restless to go farther off
pity he dont go and stick his head in and choke himself and leave you and me and a few other dashing blades to spend his money
we ought to be his of us
but we shant see the colour of his cash mark me
you wont
he hates your way of life
but hes got no quarrel with the rest of us
you never know with a man like him
im going over to him now and ive got a tale of a chap thats broke his legs
he may give me five shillings for the mans wife
hes done it before today
tis in him to do kind things only theres no easy outlet for em
keeps his goodness bottled up as if he was afraid of it
youve got his blind eye i reckon said ned
its all up with me anyway
i look way when i pass him
hell never forgive me for marrying cora
well youd best to go on and not keep your horse dancing about no longer
ned galloped off and his brother having sat a little longer by st cross rose and struck over shaugh moor in the direction of humphrey neds dwelling
the old man was expecting his nephew and came upon the waste to meet him
they had not spoken together for many days and rupert was glad to see the elder again
a year had stamped its record upon humphrey ned and the significance of his sons death might now be perceived
marks passing left a permanent scar but the expected of spirit by no means overtook the sufferer
man if he did not delight him bulked upon his mind as the supreme experience
it was an added tribulation that upon his brothers estrangement and death one of the few living beings with whom he enjoyed the least measure of intimacy had dropped out of his life
and now he became increasingly sensitive to the opinion of the people and developed a morbidity that was new
mrs susan was his frank intelligencer and more than once he to hear her tell how sensible men had spoken ill of him
now he fell into talk with rupert and uttered the things uppermost in his mind
well enough in body but sometimes i doubt if my brains all it used to be
in the head is where ill go first
rupert laughed
not much fear of that uncle
you must know answered the other that every man in this life has to suffer a certain amount of injustice
from the king on his throne to the tinker in his garret there are thorns stuffed in all pillows
human nature misunderstands itself at every turn and the closest lifelong friends often catch their secret hearts full of wonder and surprise at each other
but had more than my share of that
the injustice thats heaped upon me is insufferable at times
and why
because i dont carry my heart on my sleeve and wont with truth at the worlds bidding
tis only fools laugh at you or grumble at you
youre wrong there answered humphrey
the scorn of fools and the snarl of evil lips are a healthy sign
there are some men and some dogs that i would rather bark at me than not
but how is it that wise men and understanding men hold aloof and say hard things and look way when i pass by
lord knows answered rupert
too busy to think for themselves i suppose and take the general opinion that youre unsociable
you do many and many a kind thing but they bant known
no i dont
i my nature
kind things are often terrible silly things
leave your nathan to do the kind things
he did a kind thing when my son died and i felt it
for warmth of heart there never was such another
the trouble that man takes for people is very fine to see
im not saying hes wise
in fact i dont think he is wise
to do other folks work for em and shelter em from the results of their own folly is to think you know better than god almighty
hes wonderful good im sure
a godsend to my mother
taken all the business over for her
when father died leave that
keep on about his character said humphrey
theres nought so interesting to a man like me as burrowing into human nature and trying the works
now in your nathan you see one that has the cleverness to make nearly every human being like him and trust him
but how does he get his hold on the heart
is it by shutting his eyes to what people really are like i shut my ears to jacks arguments against the bible or is it by sheer stupid obstinate goodness that cant see the weakness and folly and wickedness and craft of human beings
he puts a large trust in his answered rupert
he believes everybody is good till hes proved em bad
humphrey nodded
true enough and ill tell you what that means in nathan
the real secret of sympathy in this world is to be a sinner yourself
theres no end to the toleration and forgiveness and of people if they know in their own hearts that they be just as bad
a wise man hedges and never will be shocked at
because he says i may be found out too some day
he broke off and his nephew spoke
i know youre just as kind really
by the same token ive come begging today
a poor chap has had a bad accident
market merry he was and got off his pony
hes in hospital with both legs broke and may not recover and his wife and four children what about his club
he wasnt a member of a club
whats his name
coombes
drunk too
and you ask me to take my money and help that sort of man
but i wont
perhaps in strict justice he dont deserve it but did you ask your nathan for him
yes
it shows the difference between you i suppose
he gave
he gave me ten shillings
theres a nice point to about
which of you was right uncle or nat
you cant both be right
we can both be right and both be wrong answered the old man
nat was preaching at the chapel a bit ago afore he had his illness and me and milly went to hear him
he preaches does he
now and work off his energy he says
but never no more will he
his voice wont stand it he says
he chose for his text a question and he said twas a simple and easy thing afore we took any step in life to ax ourselves and say what would the lord do
simple enough to so simple to answer
he seemed to think twas as simple to answer as to ask
his brain isnt built to see the difficulties
jack laughs at all these here tory christians
he says that a man can no more be a tory and a christian than he can walk on water
he says flat out that christ was wrong here and down wrong
mind i dont say so but head will argue for it very strong if youll let him
nat wouldnt hear of that
nor would i ive got as much faith as my brother
and as to what christ would do or would not do in any given case tis a matter for very close reasoning because we act only seeing the outside of a puzzle he would act seeing the inside
to say that we always know what the lord would do is to say were as wise as him
to go to the bible for an answer to trouble is right enough though
tis like a story i read in a wise book a few nights for ive taken to reading a terrible lot of books lately
it told how two fellows fell out and fought like a pair of over a bit of ground
each said twas his and presently they carried their trouble to a wise king as reigned over a near nation and was always happy to talk sense to anybody who had the time to listen
so to the neighbour kingdom they went and yet never got to the king at all
and why not
because so soon as they were in his land they found the spirit and wisdom of him working like barm in bread throughout the length and breadth of the place
they saw peace alive
they saw the people living in brotherly love and unity and understanding
they saw the religion of give and take at work
they saw travellers yielding the path to each other they saw kindness and goodness and patience the rule from the cradle to the grave and they felt so terrible ashamed of their own little pitiful quarrel that they for decency take it afore the throne but made friends there and then and shared the strip of earth between em
and so tis with the bible rupert you bring a trouble into the lords kingdom and youll find in the clear light shining there that it quickly takes a shape to shame you
tis pretty much what nat said in other words
but didnt it ought to make you give me ten shillings for coombes
for us to stand between the state and its work
but his wife and children
the sins of the fathers are visited on the children
who are we to come between god almighty and his laws
rupert shrugged his shoulders
christ almighty would have
asked ned
rupert reflected
hed have done something for certain
why of course
hed have healed the mans broken legs first
and thats what mankind is doing as best it can
and if the man dies
then the state will look after his
youre justice itself said rupert but mans justice be frosty work
thats right enough
justice and mercy is the difference between god and christ
the ones a terrible light to show the way and mark the rock and point the channel through the storm but twill dazzle your eyes if you see it too close remember
and to the cold heart what a glowing fire be to the cold body
and i say that nathans just glowing sort of man declared the younger fervently
say so and think so answered his uncle
he stands for mercy and ill never say again that he stands for mercy because he knows hell stand in need of mercy
ill never say that again
and i stand for justice and hope ill reap as i have better nor worse
but between my way and nathans way is yet another way and if i could find it then i should find the thing im seeking
the way of justice and mercy together i suppose you mean
i suppose i do
but ive never known how to mix em and keep at peace with my own conscience
justice is firm ground mercy is not
man knows that very well
we may please our with it but for my part so far as i have got till now im prone to think that mercy be gods work as vengeance is
for us tis enough that we try to be just and leave all else in higher hands
life bant a pretty thing and you cant hide its ugliness by decorating it with doubtful mercies that may look beautiful to the eye but wont stand the stark light of right
justice makes goodness a bit hard at the edges however answered his nephew
and when alls said if mercy be such treacherous ground who can deny that justice may give way under us too now and again
they now stood at the door of
enter in said ned
you argue well and theres a lot in what you say
and words come all to this as the rivers come all to the sea that we know nothing outside revelation
and now lets talk about your affairs
when is your marriage going to be
has milly said she wants me to come to it
answer the truth
chapter ii dennis dennis took the opportunity that offered after a service to meet his parish clerk and the churchyard
for the vicars sister had pointed out that the of st edwards was and choked with weeds
overhead the bells made mighty riot
two weddings had just been celebrated and the ringers were doing their best
with spring here again this place will be a scandal said dennis
you must set to work in earnest mr_gollop and if its more than you can do singlehanded youd better get help
hay is hay answered the other and the reverend was above any like what some people suffer from nowadays
he had the churchyard hay as his right in his opinion and given a good year us made a tidy little rick for him
all flesh is grass he used to say in his wise fashion and grass is not the less grass because it comes off a mans grave
i think differently
to make hay in a churchyard thomas is very bad form and shows a lack of proper and delicate feeling
anyway theres to be a thorough cleanup
weve got a lot of very interesting graves here and when people come and ask to see the churchyard i dont like wading through a foot of weeds
wheres the famous tomb with the music book and bass viol on it
i wanted to show it to a man only last week and couldnt find it
led the way and indicated a slate amid the ned monuments
there tis
a riddle and an open book and the book actually had a bit of the old music i on it when first twas set up
but time have eaten that off i believe
he was a fine fiddler in the days afore the organs was put in the church and then he had to go and he soon died after the joy of playing on sundays was taken from him
he made up his verse himself
drew back the herbage from this slate and read out the rhyme half hidden beneath
praises on tombs are to no purpose spent a mans good name is his own monument
but a good name dont last as long as a good slate when alls said
theres vivian neds stone you see
tis a great addition to the row and cost seven pounds odd
and there lieth the suicide as should be yonder if justice had been done
but humphrey ned dont mean to take his place in the family row
like him that is
wont even neighbour with his fellow dust
you to repeat such nonsense mr_gollop
nonsense or no nonsense tis the truth
heres the place hes chosen and bought it too right up in this corner away from everybody and his gravestone is to turn its back upon dead hes always turned his back upon the living
indicated a lonely corner of the churchyard
thats where hes going to await the trump
well thats his business poor man
hes a good christian anyway
if coming to church makes him so he may be but christian is as christian does in my opinion
show me a man or beast as be the better for humphrey ned and ill weigh up what sort of christian he may be
judge nobody but get this place respectable and tidy
no half measures mr_gollop
and youll have to work out all those unknown mounds with a pair of shears
they are running together and will disappear in a year or two
and that pile of broken slates in the corner had better be carted away altogether
you ought to know the graves they belong to but of course you dont
no i dont and more dont any other living man
i bant god almighty i believe
tis miss dennis have put you on to harrying me out of my seven senses this way and i wish shed mind her own business and let me mind mine
no need to be insolent
i only ask you to mind your own business
if youd do that we should never have a word
rudely
when conquered in argument he always reserved to himself not the right of final speech but the licence of final sound
on these occasions he uttered a defiant raucous explosion pregnant with contempt and scorn then he hurried away
at times under exceptional stress he would also permit himself an offensive gesture before departing
this consisted in lifting his and striking the part of his person that occurred beneath it
but such an insult was reserved for his acquaintance obviously it might not be exploited against the vicar of the parish
now mr_gollop marched off to the white thorn and dennis turning found that the man of whom they had recently spoken walked alone not far off
dennis instantly approached him
it was his wish to know this member of his congregation better but opportunity to do so had been denied
now there was no escape for humphrey ned because the minister extended his hand and saluted him
how do you do ned
glad to see you
a pretty pair of weddings and two very popular young couples i fancy
humphrey admitted it
theres no better or harder working man about here than my nephew rupert ned he said
so i understand
not much of a churchgoer though im afraid
however perhaps hell come now
the bells make the tower shake i do believe
weve never had the tenor bell rung like your son rang it mr
ned
the old man shrugged his shoulders
i always fancy so but then ive a right to fancy so
i was his father
no doubt tis folly
one pair of hands can pull a rope as well as another
but as the heart so the bell though the heart of man is generally wrong
my son would have done his best today no doubt though such was his nature that hed sooner toll alone than peal in company
are you going to the wedding breakfast
yes not that they really want me
twas only because the boys and girls wouldnt take no for an answer that i go
i doubt whether theyre in earnest
but im glad to be there too
who was the fine young brown fellow in the ned pew beside mrs
ned
nathan ned the younger
called after my brother the innkeeper
hes just off the sea for a bit
a handsome man
he is for certain
well im very glad to meet you
i was telling mr_gollop that our graves are not worthy of us
we must make the churchyard
they had reached the and dennis held neds pony while he mounted it
thank you said the elder
by the way ive never called at because ive been told you wouldnt care about it
as to that whether id care or not tis whether you ought to call or not
youre right
then come i shall
how about next friday
i shall be there
i hear youre a great reader ned
i might lend you some of my gladly would do so if youd care to have them
thank you im sure
a kindly thought in you
tis no great art to think kindly but let the thought blossom out into a deed and it grows alive
yes i read a lot now since my son died
jack is a reading man likewise but he reads terrible dangerous books
he lent me one and i burnt it
yes i burnt it and told him so
probably you were right
no i wasnt
he showed me very clearly that i was wrong
you cant burn a book
a bad book once out in the world is like a stone once belongs to the devil
not but what jack says many things that cant be luck
i wish hed bring his difficulties to me
you neednt wish that
hes got no difficulties
hes going with the wind and tide
tis you not you and me and the likes of will be in difficulties afore long
i see that plain enough
tis idle to be blind
i shall die a christian and so will you and so will your if ever you get any but alls in a welter of change now and very like your will think twas terrible funny to have a parson for a grandfather
jack says theyll put stuffed curates in the british museum afore three generations
a freethought wave said dennis
be under no concern ned
christianity is quite unassailable
remember the rock its founded on
tis the rock it will split on be the thing to consider
however if youve got any books that stand for our side i shall thank you to lend em to me
jacks had it all his own way of late
ill bring some declared dennis
they parted and humphrey trotted off on his pony
meantime at the white thorn a considerable gathering had met to discuss the weddings and nathan ned his namesake the sailor heathman cora and others enjoyed a morning drink
for some the entertainment was now ended but not a few had been to the feast at cadworthy where a double banquet was planned and many would soon set out on foot or in for the farm
one may hope for nought but good of these here weddings said joe_voysey
theres only one danger in my judgment and that is for two of the young people to set up living with the bridegrooms mother but rupert bant hester neds favourite son i believe
if he was it certainly wouldnt work
the poor chap would be pulled in two pieces between mother and wife
however if the mother bant jealous of him it may do pretty well
when master ned marries hell have to go a bit further off said the innkeeper
how is it brother ned bant married
asked the younger nathan
why tis more than a year since i heard from my sister that he was going to marry sister and yet nothing done
id make her name the day jolly quick if twas me
heathman laughed and shook his head
no you wouldnt nat
you dont know cora
none will hurry her if shes not minded to hurry
ned has done what he could and so have so has my mother
but shes in no haste
likes being engaged and making plans getting presents and having a good time and being important
the autumn will see them married however declared ned
ive told master ned that hell have to draw in his horns a bit for hes not made of money though he seems to think so
twill be his best economy to marry pretty quick and settle down
never was a man with wilder ideas about money but coras different
shes a woman with brains
hell do well to hand her over the purse
she wants to start a shop at plymouth said heathman
a shop for hats and womens things
but neds against it
he says she shant while he can help it and as he certainly wont work himself while he can help it we must hope theyve got tons of money
which they have not answered nathan ned
and the sooner ned understands that and gives ear to me the better for his peace of mind
entered at this moment
he was ruffled and annoyed
that man
he that headstrong rash man will be the death of me yet
of course i mean dennis
wont let the dead rest in their graves now
wants the churchyard turned into a seemingly
must be mowing and hacking and tacking and trimming and no more hay and even they old holy slates in the corner to be carted off as if they was common stones
lie low and do nought advised
tis a sort of fever that takes the gentleman off and on
he catches the fit from his sister
shell be down on me sometimes with all her feathers up and everything wrong
i must set to that instant moment and tidy the garden for my dear life till not a blade be out of place
likes to see the grass plot so sleek as a boys head after sunday
but the way is to listen with all due and proper attention as becomes us afore our betters and it
the true kindness and charity be to let em have their talk out and even meet em in little things here and it can be done without loss of our
but we understand best
dont you never forget that thomas
where the yard and the garden be concerned you and me must be first in the land
they be children to us and should be treated according
weve forgot more than they ever about such things
others came and went and thomas matured their fabian tactics nathan ned with his nephew and young cora set off in a pony trap for cadworthy
the bells still rioted and rang their ceaseless music for these wives and husbands were being honoured with the melodious thunder of a full peal
chapter iii cora for ned at the fork of the road above shaugh
here in the vicarage wall the stump of a village cross had been planted
round about flashed its spring stars and made ready while to the shattered symbol clung ivy tighter than ever lost sinner seeking sanctuary
upon a stone beneath sat the woman in sunday finery and she was beautiful despite her garments
they spoke of taste and a mind attracted by the garish and the crude
but her face was fair until examined at near range
then upon the obvious beauty like beginning of rust in the leaf there appeared delicate signs of the spirit within
her eyes spoke unrest and her mouth
the shadow of a permanent line connected her eyebrows and promised a network too soon to stretch its web woven by the spiders of discontent upon her forehead
cora built always upon tomorrow and she suffered the fate of those that do so
she was ambitious and vain and she harboured a false perspective in every matter touching her own welfare her own desert and her own position in the world
she largely overrated her beauty and her talents
she was satisfied with ned but had ceased to be enthusiastic about him
a year of his society revealed definite limitations and she understood that though her husband was he would never be capable
the power to earn money did not belong to him and she rated his windy and promises at their just value
she perceived that the will and intellect were hers and she knew that once married he would follow and not lead
the advantage of this position outweighed the disadvantages
she desired to live in a town and rather favoured the idea of setting up a shop to be patronised by the local leaders of rank and fashion
she loved dress and believed herself possessed of much natural genius in matters sartorial
at present ned absolutely refused any suggestion of a shop but she doubted not that power rested with her presently to insist if she pleased to do so
he was a generous and fairly devout lover
he more than satisfied her requirements in that direction
she had indeed cooled his ardour a little and she supposed that her commonsense was gradually modifying his amorous disposition
but anothers commonsense is a weak weapon against lust and neds sensual energies dammed by cora found secret outlet elsewhere
so it came about that he endured the ordeal of the lengthy engagement without difficulty and the girl wore his fancied sobriety and as a feather in her cap
when she related her achievement to ned and explained to him how much his character already owed to her influence he admitted it without a blush and solemnly assured her that she had changed his whole attitude to the sex
now the man arrived and they walked together by corner southerly of shaugh upon the
their talk was of the autumn wedding and the necessity for some active efforts to decide their domicile
cora was for a suburb of plymouth but ned wanted to live in the country outside
the shop she did not mention after his recent strong expressions of aversion from it but she desired the first step to be such that transition to town might easily follow when marriage was accomplished and her power became paramount
they decided at length to visit certain places that stood between town and country above plymouth
there were stoke and to see
a villa was coras villa and two servants
neds instincts on the other hand led to a small hawk_house and a large stable
he owned some horses and took great part of his pleasure upon them
since possession of her own steed however coras regard for riding had diminished
it was her way to be quickly satisfied with a new toy
now she spoke of a victoria so that when she was married she might drive daily upon her shopping and her visiting
the thing is to begin well she said
people call according to your hawk_house and often the difference between nice blinds and common blinds will decide women whether theyll visit a newcomer or not
with my taste you can trust the outside of your home to look all right ned
at i saw the very sort of hawk_house id like for us to have
such a style and i couldnt think what twas about it till i saw the short blinds was all hung in bright shining brass rods across the windows and the was all painted
ill have my hawk_house just like that
i thought
so you any colour you please
and ill have my stable smart too i promise you
white tiles all through
i shall have to do a bit myself you after the horses i nobody will know it
youll keep a man of course
a cheap one
nathan went into figures with me last week
he was a bit vague and i was a bit impatient and soon had enough of it
all i want to know i told him is just exactly what income i can count upon and he said five hundred a year was the outside figure
then against that you must set that hes getting a bit old and of course being another persons money hes extra cautious
he admitted that if i sold out some shares and bought others i could get pretty near another one hundred a year by it
but of course weve got to take a bite out of the money for furnishing and all the rest of it
my idea as you know is to invest a bit in a sleeping partnership but he hasnt found anything of the sort yet apparently
hes not the man he was at finding a bargain
here opened a good opportunity for her ambitions and cora ventured to take it
i wish youd think twice about letting me start a little business
its quite a ladylike thing or i wouldnt offer it but with my natural cleverness about clothes and with all the time ive given to the fashions and all with the hats i can seems a pity not to let me do it
you dont want much money to start with and i should soon draw the custom
no he said
time enough if ever we get hard up
im not going to have you making money
tis your business to spend it
youll be a lady with your own servants and all the rest of it
youll walk about and pick the flowers in your garden and pay visits and if you do have a little trap you can drive out to the meets sometimes when i go hunting
why damn it all cora i should have thought you was the last girl who would ever want to do such a thing
thats all you know she said
people who keep hat shops often get in with much bigger swells than ever were likely to know at or stoke either
they come into the shop and they see of course im a lady and i explain that i only keep the shop for fun and then i get to know them
id make more swell friends in my hat shop than ever you do on your horse out
i know a lot of swells for that matter
ask em to come to tea and then youll see if you know em she said
tis no use for us to be silly
were poor people compared to rich ones and we always shall be so far as i can see
we must be content with getting up the ladder a thats all i ask or expect
i know my place all right if thats what you mean answered ned
im not anxious to get in with my betters for theyre not much use to me
im easily satisfied
i want for you to have a good time and i mean for myself to have a good time
you can only live your life once and a mans a fool to let worry come into his life if he can escape from it
the great thing in the world is to find people who think as you do yourself
thats worth a bit of trouble and when youve found them stick to them
a jolly good motto too
they spilt words to feeble purpose for another and then there came an acquaintance
timothy timothy appeared on his way from farm
he overtook them and walked beside them
i suppose you dont want company he said but ill leave you half a mile further on
we do want company and always shall declared cora
and yours most of all im sure
were past the silly stage
in fact we never got into it did we edward
you didnt said her betrothed and as you didnt i couldnt
takes two
mr timothy remained a bachelor and no woman had ever been mentioned in connection with him
he was highly eligible and indeed a husband much to be desired
he enjoyed prosperity good looks and a reputation for sense and industry
cora he had always admired and still did so
at heart he wondered why she had chosen ned and sometimes since the marriage hung fire he suspected that she was not entirely satisfied of her bargain and might yet change her mind
he would have married her willingly for there was that in her practical and unsentimental character which appealed to him
he had indeed contemplated proposing when the announcement of young neds engagement reached him
he met cora sometimes and always admired her outlook on life
he did so now yet knowing ned too doubted at heart whether the woman had arrested his propensities as completely as she asserted
the question on our lips when you came along was where we should set up shop said ned
a shop is what i really and truly want to set up declared cora but edward wont hear of fool him i say
he cant earn money but thats no reason why i shouldnt try to
mr timothy entirely agreed with her
no reason why you shouldnt
if to be handed over to rupert and youre going to live in plymouth as i hear he said then why not business
theres nothing against it that i know and theres nothing like it
if i wasnt a farmer id keep a shop
for that matter a farmer does keep a shop
only difference that i can see is that he has fields instead of cupboards and loses good money through the middleman between him and his customers
im going to take another stall in plymouth market after midsummer
theres nought like market work for saving cash
and as nearly half our money will come from the rent that rupert pays for cadworthy we shall be living by a shop in a sense whether you pretend to or not added cora
but ned denied this
he aired his views on political economy while timothy who valued money yet valued making it still more reduced the others opinions to their proper and laughed at him into the bargain
timothys contempt for ned was not concealed
he even permitted himself a sly jest or two at the expense of the others mental endowments and these thrusts while by the victim stabbed coras breast somewhat keenly
even timothys laughter she told herself was more sane and manly than neds
she fell into her own vice of contrasting the thing she had with the thing she had not to the detriment of the former
it was an instinct with her to undervalue her own possessions but the instinct stopped at unusual circumstance
with herself and her attributes of mind and body she never quarrelled it was only her environment that by no possibility compared favourably with that of other people
her mother her sister her brother her betrothed and her but seemed really unworthy of cora when dispassionately judged by herself
now she weighed timothys decision against neds doubt his knowledge against neds ignorance his sense against neds nonsense
she felt the farmers allusions and she with discomfort because ned did not also feel them and retort upon mr timothy in like manner
she told herself that the difference between them was the radical difference between a wise man and a fool
then she fell back in of her own judgment and assured herself that physically there could be no comparison and that ned had a better heart and would make a gentler husband
timothy had admired remembered that but he was caution personified and while he had considered ned had plunged
she strove to see this as a virtue in ned
yet timothys old attitude to her forbade any slighting of him
she remembered very well how when he congratulated her on her engagement he had pointedly praised ned for one thing alone his precipitation
a fault at other seasons may be a virtue in the love season
i thought him not very clever said timothy on that occasion but now i see he was than any of us
because he was too clever to waste a moment in getting what every other chap wanted
we learn these things too late
he said that and said it with great significance
it comforted cora now to remember the circumstance
whatever else ned might not know he knew a good deal about women and that would surely make him by so much a better husband
then her wits told her the opposite might be argued from this premise
she was not enjoying herself and she felt glad when timothy left them
anon ned rallied her for lengthened and even hinted as a jest that he believed she was regretting her choice
they turned presently and went back over shaugh moor to drink tea at the mans home
but upon the threshold cora changed her mind
she pleaded headache and some anxiety about her health
ive got a cold i wouldnt be so she said
ill get back through north wood and go to bed early
he instantly expressed utmost solicitation and concern
ill come back with you then
if you like ill put in the pony and drive you he said
but she would neither of these things
i shall be all right
you go in and have your tea and dont trouble
ill get back by the wood path and youll find i shall be better tomorrow
tis that flimsy dress that lets the wind through like a net he said
the weathers not right for such clothes as you will wear
but she laughed and told him to mind his own business
then she kissed him on the cheek and went away
he stood doubtful
first he felt moved to follow her and then he changed his mind
he knew cora better than she thought he did and he was aware that at the present moment she felt perfectly well but desired to be alone
he had not missed the significance of mr timothys views on his sweethearts mind though he had failed to appreciate timothys sly humour at his own expense
now therefore he let cora have her will and made no further effort to overtake her
he only until she looked back as he knew she would then he kissed his hand turned and departed
she passed along through the forest homeward and when hidden in a silent place dusted a stone and sat down to think
a wild apple tree rose above her half smothered in a great
but through the darkness of the parasite infant sprays of bright young foliage sprang and splashed the gloomy evergreen with verdure
aloft crowning this gnarled and elbowed crab burst out a triumphant wreath of pale pink diaphanous and curled
full of light and pearly purity it feathered on the bough and its tender brightness was splashed with crimson beads of the that their time and turn to open
higher still dominating the tree thrust forth a crooked naked bough or two
they towered black dead and grim above the loveliness of the living thing beneath
from reflections not agreeable this good sight attracted cora and turned the tide of her thoughts
even here the instinct of business dominated any sentiment that might have in another spirit before such beauty
she gazed at it then rose and plucked a few sprays of the
next she took off her hat and began to try the effect of the natural flowers therein
her efforts pleased her not a little
lord
what a hand i have for it
she said aloud
then by this evidence of her skill she rose and proceeded to shaugh
i know one thing she thought and that is man or no man i shall always be able to make my living singlehanded in a town
for that i want a husband
and be it as twill when master ned finds a lot more money coming in hed very soon give over crying out at a shop
chapter iv humphrey ned still sought to determine his need and sometimes supposed that he had done so
more than once he had contemplated the possibility of peace by flight then there happened incidents to change his mind
of late the idea of a home further from distracting influences had again seemed good to him
more than once he considered the advantages of isolation more than once he rode upon the moor and distracted his gloom with visions of imaginary dwellings in regions remote
the folly of these thoughts often thrust him with a rebound into the life of his and those who knew him best observed a rhythmic alternation in humphrey
after periods of abstention and loneliness would follow some return to a more sociable style of living
from a fierce hectic of mind that sent him sore and savage into the heart of the wilderness he cooled and grew temperate again as the intermittent fever passed
and then when the effort towards his kind had failed by his own ineptitude and the worlds mistrust he retreated once more to suffer and banished himself behind the clouds of his own restless soul
humanity has no leisure to decipher these difficult spirits the pathos of their attempts must demand a philosophic eye to perceive it and unless kind chance offers the key unless opportunity affords an explanation the lonely but hungry heart passes away sinks to the grave unread and
inner darkness turned to the moor again and he often he had already ridden to inspect the ruin of an old dwelling upon the side of a great hill above the waters of plym
brilliant summer smiled upon this pilgrimage and as he went he fell in with a friend where jack the high road upon his way to
jack now dwelt at shaugh but was head man of saul_luscombe farm and rabbit warren
a fine day said humphrey as he slowed his pony
yes and a finer coming answered the other
ned was quick to note the militant tone
been at your silly books again i warrant he said
theres one book i could wish youd read along with jack
tis the salt to all other books for all you scorn it
bibles a broken reed master as youll live to find out yet
no jack
tis what makes all other writing but a broken reed
a fountain that never runs dry i promise you
no man will ever get the whole truth out of the bible
no by gor
because it bant there said the other
its there all for the little children to find it
you bandage your eyes and then you say you cant fools trick that
i can see so far as you
tis you put coloured spectacles on your nose to make things look as youd have em
your book be played out master
let the read it if you like along with the other fairy tales but dont think grown men be going to waste their time with it
the whole truth is that the book be built on a lie
there never was no jehovah and never will be
moses invented him to frighten the folk from their same as you invent a scarecrow to frighten the birds from the seed
and the scarecrow works better than jehovah did by all accounts
you talk out of your narrow bitter books jack
no need to call my books names
thats all your side can do
why dont they try to answer em instead of em
tis a great danger to the poor that they begin to think so much
dont you say that
knowledge be the weapon the poor have been waiting for all these years and years
tis the only weapon for a poor man
and what will it soon show em
itll show em that the most powerful thing on this earth be the poor
they are just going to find it out then you rich people will hear of something that will terrible astonish you
youre a rank socialist jack
ive no patience with you
there you are no patience
but thats another thing we men of the soil be going to teach you chaps who own the soil
patience you say
theres a time coming when the rich people will have to be mighty patient i warn you
and if youre tis all one to us for never was heard that any impatient man could stop the tide flowing
i believe that said ned grimly
youll pay us presently for teaching you and clothing you and helping to enlarge your minds
when youre learned enough youll turn round like the snake and bite the hand that fed you
gratitude the common soul never knows and never will whatever else it may learn
knowledge is poison to low natures and we ought to have kept you ignorant and harmless
jack stared
thats a pretty speech
he said
thats a good healthy bit of christian
why for should you ax so much credit for your side
take me
whats the rich man done for me
a boy i was
and look at you nowa prosperous man and saving money
who fed you and taught you and brought you up
the state
society saved you society played mother to you and now you want to kick her
thats how youd pay your debts
you take a base and a narrow too
the state have got to look after the rich as well as the poor
why not
the poor arent everybody
youre the sort that think no man can be a decent member of society unless he was born in a gutter
class prejudice tis called and some of the chaps who think theyre the salt of the earth stink of it
class be damned said mr_head
class is all stuff and nonsense
there are only two men and bad ones
the difference between a duke and me be difference between a pig with a ring in his nose and another without one
wem built the same to the last bone in our bodies and ive got more sense than half the dukes in the kingdom
and half have got more sense than you returned the rider
its summed up in a word
class there will be because class there must be
the poor we have always with know that well enough
your books though they deny most things cant deny that
another of your silly christian sayings
we have got the poor with it wont be always
so long as we have the rich with us we shall have the poor and no longer
no longer master
finish off the one and youll finish off
thats a bit of homegrown wisdom that is got from no book at all
wisdom you call it
and what power is going to root out the rich
how are you clever folk going to alter human nature and say to this man you shant save your money and to this man you shall save yours
while some men and women are born to thrift and sense and some to folly and squandering there must be rich and poor and while men are born to hunger for power there must be war
these things cant be changed
and you cant say where any man can reach to you cant put up a mark and tell your you shant go higher than that
granted
you cant say where they shall reach to but you can say where they shall start from
half the worlds handicapped at the
i only ax for the race to be a fair one
i only ax for my son to start fair with yours
if yours be the better man then let him win but dont let him win because hes got too long a start
thats not justice but tyranny
give every man his chance and make every man all i ask
if a mans only got the wits to break stones then see that he breaks em and let them who can do better and earn better money not grudge the a little over and above what his poor wits earn in the market
i grant thats good admitted ned
let the strong help the weak
twas christ found that out not you socialists
tis found out anyway said jack
and tis true and therefore it will happen and we cant go back on it
and it follows from that law of strong helping weak that nobody ought to be too rich any more than they ought to be too poor
let the state be a millionaire a million times over if you only the state
so long as the hive be rich no bee is poor
humphrey did not immediately reply
he was following heads argument to a still larger conclusion
and youd argue that as the strong man can help the weak one so in time the strong state might help the weak one instead of hindering it and the powerful of the earth give of their abundance to strengthen the humble and feeble
why not
instead of that the great powers be bristling with fighting men and all the sinews of the world be wasted on war
and it shows the uselessness of the book anyway that the christian the biggest armies and the largest number of men idle rotting their bodies and souls away in barracks and battleships
ned nodded
theres sense of a lopsided sort in much that you say jack
but the book thats to the world that misunderstands the book and darent go by the of the nations around that dont go by it
then why do they pretend christians
they know if they went by the book theyd go down yet they want to drive it into the heads of the next generation
the child hears his father damning the government because they bant building enough and next day when the boy comes home with a black eye his father turns round and tells him to mind his bible and remember that the peacemakers be blessed
i could wish a government would give christianity a chance confessed ned but i suppose tis much the same thing as free fine thing if everybody played the game but a poor thing for one nation if are all for protection
thats a lie answered mr_head
weve shown free trade is a fine weve shown it and why
because free trades a strong sword but christianitys rusty and wont stand the strain no longer
weve passed that stage and if we was to start christianity now and offer the cheek to the hed damn soon smite and then where are we
they on and set the world right according to their outlook instinct and understanding
then the conversation turned into personal channels and ned while admitting the justice of much that jack asserted yet blamed him for a certain impatience and bitterness
if evolution is going to set all right and the unborn will come into a better world why get so hot
he asked
because im a thinking feeling man answered the other
because i hate to see wrong done in the name of right
and youre the you havent got as much sense as me seemingly
im only want to be useful and dont see how
i want to do my part in the world but just the right way is difficult to choose out among the many roads that offer jack
you are positive and that saves a deal of trouble no doubt
the positive people go the good or evil
but im not so certain
i see deeper than you because ive been better educated though im not so clever by nature
then theres another
people dont like me and to be disliked limits a mans usefulness a lot
thats stuff answered jack no more than a maggot got in your head
if they dont like you theres a reason
feared of your sharp tongue and think tis the key to a hard heart
then tis for you to show em what they cant see
ill tell you what you are a man sitting hungry in a wheatfield because you dont know and wont how to turn corn into bread
thats you in a word
was reached and jack went his way
you might come and drink a dish of tea some sunday said ned and the other promised to do so
then humphrey proceeded beside the river and presently ascended a rough slope to his destination
the ruin that alternately drew and repelled him lay below but for the moment he did not seek it
he climbed to the high ground dismounted turned his pony loose and took his pipe out of his pocket
the great cone of granite known as hen tor lies high upon the eastern bank of plym between that and the tableland of beyond
from its crown the visitor marked cornwalls coastline into the west and bay reflecting silver morning light along the darker boundaries of earth
spaces of grass and fern extended about the tor and far below a midget that was a man moved along the edge of the ripe bracken and mowed it down with a scythe
half a dozen carrion crows took wing and flapped with loud croaking away as humphrey ascended the tor and sat upon its summit
again he traversed the familiar scene in his mind again perceived the difficulties of transit to this place
occasionally before these problems he had set to work obstinately and sought solutions
once he had determined to rebuild the ruin in the valley so that he might turn his back on man and make trial of the anchorites isolation and hermits bastard peace but today he was in no mood for such experiments his misanthropic fit passed upon the west wind and his thoughts took to themselves a brighter colour
where he sat two were visible separated by the distant height of legis tor
and alone appeared and for the rest the river roamed between them and flocks and herds wandered upon the hills around
the man still moved below and long ribbons of fallen fern spread regularly behind him
a foul smell struck on neds nostrils and he saw death not far distant where the crows had been frightened from their meal
he climbed away from the main pile of the tor and sat in a natural chair hollowed from the side of an immense block of granite that stands hard by
he smoked and his pony grazed
a storm of rain fell and passed
the sun succeeded upon it and for a little while the moor with moisture
then the wind dried all again
the old man was now entirely out of tune with any thought of a dwelling here
he did not even descend the hill and inspect the ruin beneath
but he had come to spend the day alone and was contented to do so
his mind busied itself with the last thing that a had said to him
he repeated jacks word over and over to himself
presently he ate the food that he had brought with him drank at a spring and walked about to warm his body
the carrion crows cried in air soared hither and thither settled again on the rocks at hand and with the perfect patience of unconscious nature for him to depart
but he remained until the end of the day
then occurred a magnificent spectacle
after gold of evening had scattered the moor and made dark peat and grey rock burn there rolled up from the south an immense fog that spread its nacreous sea under the sunset
born of fierce heat upon the ocean it advanced and enveloped earth valley by valley and ridge by ridge
only the highest peaks evaded this flood of vapours and upon them presently sank the sun
his light descending touched many points and uplifted sprays of mist whereon like magic a thousand galleons rode over the pearl and advanced in a golden flotilla upon this fleeting sea
the rare brief wonder passed and the sky above it faded the sun sank the fog rolled cold a burden for the wet wings of night
humphrey set off and the carrion crows full hungry returned to sup
in neds mind certain words reverberated still as they had often done since they were spoken during the morning
they chimed to the natural sounds that had fallen upon his ear throughout the day they were echoed in the wind and the distant in the cry of birds and call of beasts in the steady rasping of his ponys teeth through the herbage and now in its as it trotted by a homeward
and louder than all these repetitions of it louder than the natural music that seemed to utter the words in many voices there came the drumming of his own pulse laden with the same message and the answering beat of his heart that affirmed the truth of it
a man sitting hungry in a wheatfield because you dont know and wont learn how to turn corn into bread
chapter v milly and her husband rupert came on a sunday to drink tea at
they found humphrey from home but he had left a message with susan to say that he would return before five oclock
hes got the said mrs susan
they have fastened cruel in his and started on his pony and gone off to see the doctor
wont have none of my though i know whats good for well enough and ive cured three cases to common knowledge that neither doctor nor that mr_gollop mr_gollop could budge do as they would
rupert expressed concern and went out to meet his uncle while milly stopped and helped susan to prepare tea
and how do e like being married
asked the elder
very well but not quite so well as i thought to answered milly with her usual frankness
ah
same with most though few have the pluck to confess it
being married is a very fine thing if youve got such a husband as rupert but living along with your husbands people aint so fine if you understand me
you see hes farmer now and he will have his waya terrible resolute chap where the land and the things be concerned
but sometimes his mother gets a bit restive at ruperts orders and sometimes she says in her quiet way as her husband never would have held with this or that
tis a thought awkward now and again because you see rupert bant the favourite and never was
you side with him of course
always and always shall or wrong
maybe when master neds married and away mrs ned will go easier
dont think im grumbling
shes a kind woman but like all old married folk seem to think young married folk be only playing at it
the truth is that i havent got enough to do for the minute
ned returned in half an hour and rupert walked beside him
then with some silent suffering the old man alighted and a boy took the pony to its stable
doctor was out he said so ill have to trouble you to make up a bit of your ointment after all
and so i will answered susan
and if youd gone to that mr_gollop woman for the she pretends will cure everything id never have forgiven you
she helped to kill off your brother no doubt but thats no reason why you should give her a chance to kill you
youre all alike he said a jealous generation
but if you can have your physic ready in an hour so much the better then rupert shall give my back a good rub before he goes
mrs susan was doubtful
better i do it she said
tis the way its rubbed in makes the cure
hes stronger and can rub harder answered the patient
nathans none too grand neither declared his nephew
wont say whats amiss but i do think hes not all he might be
i asked mrs cora who knows more about him than anybody i reckon and she told me twas nothing much in her his throat a bit queer
you and nathan ought to have wives to look after you declared milly as she poured out tea
you men be unfinished awkward things alone
always wanting us at every turn for one reason or another and after middle age a man looks a fool half his time if he havent got a woman for his own
men do the big things and alter the face of the earth and all that but what becomes of their clever greatness without our clever

you all talk that stuff and worth answering
ask the sailors if they cant sew better than their sweethearts
ned was in a hard mood and would allow no credit to the sex
he endured his pain without comment but it echoed itself in impatient and rather bitter speeches
rupert fell back on other members of the family and spoke of his uncle the master of the white thorn
the good that man does isnt guessed he said
the little be surprising neither for every soul you meet speaks well of him and a man cant win to that without being a wonder
hes made of human kindness and yet never remembers the kind things he memory for em at all
humphrey conceded the nobility of this trait and milly spoke
not like some we could name wholl give a gift today and fling it in your face tomorrow
there are such
my mothers father was such a one said ned
he never forgot a hed done himself
he checked his good angels record terrible sharp did that man
there came an interruption here and unexpected visitors in the shape of nicholas bassett the young man who had married polly ned and polly herself
nicholas was nervous and stood behind his wife polly was also nervous but the sight of her brother rupert gave her courage
her uncle welcomed her with astonishment
wonders never cease he said
i didnt count to get a visit from you polly or your husband either
you neednt stand there turning your sunday hat round and round bassett
i shant eat you though people here do seem to think im a maneater
we came for advice said polly and i made bold to bring nicholas
in fact twas his idea that i should speak to you
ned was gratified but his nature forbade him to show it
a new thing to come to uncle humphrey when you might go to nathan he said
tis just about nathan is the difficulty declared his niece
then she turned to her husband
you speak nick
you must know that nicks rather slow of speech and cant get his words always but hes improving
tell uncle humphrey how tis nick
mr bassett nodded dried a damp brow with a red handkerchief and spoke
tis like this here he began
under vivian neds being my wifes had five hundred pound
we all know that said rupert
and may too
well the law of the will was that the money should be handed over when the girls was wedded or when they to the age of
therefore surely its clear as my wife ought to have her five
perfectly the day she married you said rupert
i thought youd got it polly
but i havent
theres legal nathan says and he told nicholas that there was a doubt in his mind was it nick
the man said that as trustee for everybody he was very unwilling to disturb the money
he said twas out at interest and doing very well and he said hed pay us five per centum upon it which to pounds a year
youre entitled to the capital if you want it declared ned
it cant be withheld
ive been to the man twice since said pollys husband and hes always terrible busy or else just going into it in a few days or something like that
weve had six months interest on it but we want the least half of weve got ideas about leasing a field where we live to and buying a cow in calf and a lot of poultry
with all pollys farm cleverness we can do better with a bit of money than leave it in the bank
at least thats what we think
ask rupert here to help suggested her uncle
hes on very good terms with nat and hes a man of business now and pollys elder brother and a right to be heard
no doubt if he says plain and clear that he wants you to have your money without delay youll get it
id leave it till autumn after neds marriage said rupert then id press him to clear things up
ned will want tons of money then and i believe cora is to have a money present from nathan
she got the secret out of her mother and of course told ned and now everybody knows
but nobody knows the figure
therefore i say polly had better do nought till the wedding
nathans temper isnt what it was said ruperts wife
his health be fretting him a lot i believe
i wish i had our money anyhow declared mr bassett but if you say wait till autumn of course we will do so
humphrey ned spoke but little
he had fallen into deep private thought upon this news and now was only aroused by his niece getting up to depart
i hope youll forgive us for troubling you said polly but weve talked it over a thousand times and we felt we ought to take the opinion of some wiser person
still if you say wait well wait
i didnt say wait answered her uncle and i dont take any responsibility for it
rupert advised you to wait not me
if a man owed me under a alone five hundred have it and wouldnt wait a minute
the young couple departed in a good deal of agitation and debated this advice very earnestly all the way home but rupert stuck to his own opinion and when they were gone humphrey for giving such counsel
im sure such a thing would hurt nathan cruelly he said
tis as much as to say that you dont trust trust a man who is trusted by the countryside as none ever was before
easy to be about other peoples money answered his uncle
only if twas yours and not your sisters i rather think youd be a bit less patient with the man that held it from you
yet another visitor appeared and the family matter was dropped
mrs susan brought in mr_head
looks as if the whole countryside was coming here she declared
heres jack for a cup of tea and the ointment will be cool enough to use in half an hour
bear
said rupert
whod have thought of seeing you
i was axed to tea when i felt in a mind to come replied mr_head and here i am if not in the way
and as to being a bear im the sort that needs a lot of stirring up afore i wife will back me up in that
hows ned faring
got the rheumatism answered humphrey
rupert here be going to rub in some ointment presently
i hope twill break the heart of it im sure
theres nothing worse
it tells us the truth about our parts better than any sermon
im not too gay today myself
we was at it hammer and tongs in the white thorn last and your brother
such a tory was never seen in the land afore
i very soon settled tom mr_gollop and a few others like him but nathans got more learning and more power of argument
we drank than usual owing to the of the night and the flow of speech
quarts i must have took and when ben north looked in to say twas closing time nothing would do but a few of us went in your brothers room after hawk_house was shut and went at it again
say you were drunk in a word jack suggested rupert
not drunk near it
we all got in sight of it
theres no prophet like the next morning after a wet night
as a man fond of the flesh i say it
and the older you grow the sharper comes the day after a
then nature gives you a proper talking to and your heart swells with good resolutions against beer and other things
and then as soon as you are as right as by keeping those good if nature dont tumble down what shes set up and tempt you with all her might to go on the loose again
you cant steady her though she can mighty soon steady you
preaches to you one minute and then starts off to get you into mischief the next
thats her more sense than any other female
then so much the less reason to put your trust in her answered ned
shes a poor savage thing at best
tis madness to trust her for nothing is weaker than she
nothing is stronger or so strong declared jack
nature knows what she wants and she gets what she wants
you cant deny that
shes just and never does nothing without a reason
very different to a woman there
shem digging her claws into your back because youve been doing some foolish thing ill warrant
he drank his tea and aired his opinions
but ned was in no mood for jacks philosophy
he retired presently with rupert stripped to the waist and endured a great and forcible application of mrs susans ointment
the friction brought comfort with it and he declared himself better as a result
but he did not again descend from his chamber and presently the three visitors departed together
mr_head expressed great admiration for susan
i should like to be better acquaint with that woman he declared
for sense in few words theres not her equal about
if you want to please her cuss mr_gollop mr_gollop explained rupert
chapter vi the setting sun burnt upon shoulder and beat in a sea of light against the western face of north wood until the forest edge taking colour on trunk and bough glowed heartily
already the first summer splendour was dimmed for these lofty domains suffered full fret of storm and of season
a proleptic instinct stamped by the centuries inspired this wood it anticipated more sheltered neighbours in autumn though it lagged behind them in spring
upon its boughs the last vernal splendour into being and the first autumnal stain was always visible
now beech and larch revealed a shadow in their texture of leaf and needle though august had not passed for their foliage was born into elemental strife
here homed the west wind and the salt south storms emptied their vials here the last snows lingered and may frost pinched the young green things
now and gracious light penetrated the heart of the wood warmed its recesses and dwelt upon a track that wound through the midst
toward this path by convergent ways there came a man and woman
as yet half a mile separated them for they had entered the wood at opposite places but one desire actuated both and they moved slowly nearer until they met at a tryst in the deep heart of the trees
undergrowth rose about them and their resort was carefully chosen and perfectly concealed
here oak closely clad the hill and granite boulders offered an inner rampart against observation
the man and woman were elderly yet she was still personable and he retained a measure of unusual good looks
they came to perform a little rite sacred and secret an event celebrated these many years and unknown to any other human beings but themselves
nathan ned put his arms round priscilla cora and drew her beside him and kissed her
we shall never find it this year im much afraid he said
the time is past
tis always later far than other lilies in the garden but not so late as this
however ill do my best
no matter for the flower she answered so long as we keep up our custom
a slant flame from the sunset stole deliciously through the dusky of the wood and played on the deep mosses and and the tawny motley of the earth spread like a beneath
here dead litter of leaf and twig made the covering of the ground and through it sprang various seedling things presently to bear their part in the commonwealth and succeed their forefathers
the ground was where the sunshine won to it and everywhere stretched ivy and bramble the lemon light of sparkled green sorrel and rose dim woodbine that wound its arms around the sapling oaks
and prospered together and where water spouted out of the hill there spread green and ruddy mosses embroidered with foliage of marsh violet and crowned by pallid umbels of angelica
the silver of birches flashed hard by and the rowans berries already warmed to scarlet
hither after their meeting came the man and woman and then nathan searching sharply uttered a cry of triumph and pointed where at their feet grew certain dark green leaves that sprouted from the grass
here dwelt only wild haunt in the man now made haste to find a blossom and present it to his mistress
but he failed to do so
only a dead spike or two appeared and presently he gave up the search with some disappointment
they must have bloomed just when i was ill and couldnt come he said
tis no matter at all she answered
the thought and the meeting here are the good thing
well go back into the wood now further from the path
to me tis marvellous nat to think the crafty world has never guessed
it is he admitted
and sometimes in my dark we can leave that today
were near at the end of our labours so far as the children are concerned
cora was always the most difficult
but the futures bright save for the cash side
i hope to god twill come right afore the wedding but go on she said
we cant pretend to be so happy as usual this year
lets face it
i know youre worried to death
but moneys nought alongside your health
youre better again youve shown me that clear enough
and nothing else matters to us
yes im all right i hope
but im a bit under the weather
things have gone curiously crooked ever since vivian died
i was a fool
i wont disguise that but somehow my luck seemed so good that a few little troubles never looked worth considering
then just before he went i got into a regular thunderstorm
it blew up against the steady wind of my good fortune as thunderstorms will
vivian did me a good turn by dying just when he didi cant deny it and everything is all right all practical purposes
the silver mine will be a wonder of the world by all accounts
still ive had a good deal to trouble me and things look worse when a mans sick
shall you be giving polly bassett her money soon
heathman tells me her husbands grumbling a bit
all in good time
when our cora is married i shall try and fork out a good slice of vivians estate
ned must have the capital he wants and ive got to find a hundred for coras wedding gift
why do that yet
ill do it if i have to sell myself up he said fiercely
isnt she my first favourite of our three
dont i worship the ground she goes on and love her better than anything in the world after you yourself
she sighed
how it weighs heavier and heavier after all these years
and i always thought weigh lighter and lighter
we were fools to have
but for them we could have let the world know and been married and back the five thousand to your wifes people
but not now for the childrens sake i suppose
theyll know in good time and none else
when i come to my end im going to tell em im their father according to your wish and because ive promised you on my oath to do it but none else must ever know it and it would be a wiser thing priscilla if you could only see it so that they didnt either
they must know and they shall
well it may be sooner than anybody thinks
the position is clear enough i might have married and still kept the five thousand because the lawyers said that my dead wifes wish wouldnt hold water in law but i didnt know that till twas too late and your first child had come
then we talked it out and you was content and so was i
now there are three of them and though id face the music so brave as you and go to my grave spurned by all men if necessary what would better it for them
nothing short of an act of parliament would make em legitimate now
i kept the condition of my dead wife because you urged me to do it and werent feared of the consequences but now though i can make you my lawful wife i cant make them my lawful children and therefore surely tis better they shall never know they are my children at all
twas a promise she said and i hold you to it
im fixed on it that they shall know
very well so it shall be then
only for gods sake look to it for everybodys sake that it dont get out after and ruin you all
i shouldnt sleep in my grave if i thought the lifelong secret was common knowledge
you can trust them to keep it i should think
the girls yes but so easy and careless
suppose you was to marry me even now nat would that help
ill do it as ive always said ill do it
but that means i should be in honour bound to pay five thousand to my first wifes people
well i canti cant at this a penny of it
just now im a good deal driven
in a year or two i might no doubt but theres that tells me a year or two he put up his hand to his throat
you swore to me on your oath that you were better last time you came down by night
i was here down and maybe twill lift again and maybe it wont
but we must be ready
id give my eternal soul if things were a little straighter but of wanted for that and tis just time i cant count upon
im not so young as i was and ive not the head for figures i used to have
if you dont marry youve got absolute power to dispose of that five thousand
tis yours in fact
yet at best thats a paltry quibble as youve admitted sometimes
leave it he said
dont let this day be nought but cloud
were married afore god but not afore man because to do that would have lost me five thousand pounds
when i die ive the right to make over that money to least whats left of it
thats a certainty for me and heathman and phyllis
leave it he cried
you know that what a man can do i shall do
youre more to me than any living much more
youre my life and youve been my life for thirty you will be to the end of my life
i know where i stand and how i stand
dont think id care to live a day longer than you do nat
dont think im careful for myself after you be gone
tis only for your boy and girl as i care to know anything
he took her hand
i know you well priceless woman
he answered
lets go a bit further through the forest
come what may alls got to be bright and cheerful at coras wedding and after when theyve got their money ill have a good go into things with my lawyer at
hes heard nothing yet but he shall hear everything
have no fear of the upshot
i know where ive always trusted and never in vain
like two children they walked hand in hand together
for a long time neither spoke then she addressed him
youve taught me to be brave and put a bright face on life afore the world and now ill not be wanting
well i know that
brave
tis too mild a a word for you
youve come through your life in a way that would maze the people with wonder if they only knew it
so secret so patient so clever
never was heard or known the like
a wonderful wife in ten thousand
the sun began to sink where cornwall like a purple cloud rose far off against the sky yet still the undulations of the land mingling with glory melted into each other under the sunset and still north wood shone above the shadows
but a deep darkness began to stretch upwards into it where the immense shade was projected across the valley
at length only the corner of the forest flashed a final fire then that too vanished and the benighted trees sighed and and massed themselves into amorphous under the twilight
the man and woman stopped together a while longer and after that their converse ended
they caressed and prepared to go back by different ways into the world
come good or evil fair weather or foul may we have a few happy returns yet of this day and may i live to find you the again once or twice before the end he said
for answer she kissed him again but could not trust herself to speak
chapter vii life is a compromise and a concession
according to the measure of our diplomacy so much shall we win from our fellows according to our physical endowment so much will nature grant
all men are envoys to the court of the world and it depends upon the power behind them whether they are heard and heeded or slighted and ignored
to change the figure each among us sets up his little shop in the social mart and tries to tempt the buyer but few are they who expose even necessary wares and fewer still the contemporary purchasers who know a treasure when they see it
an accident now lifted the curtain from humphrey neds nature threw him for a day into the companionship of his kind and revealed to passing eyes a gleam of the things hidden within him
no conscious effort on his part contributed to this illumination for he was incapable of making such
his curse lay in this that he desired to sell yet lacked wit to win the ear of humanity or interest in any buyers bosom
yet now the goods he offered with such ill grace challenged attention
accident focussed him in a crowd and first the people were constrained to admit his presence of mind at a crisis and then they could not choose but grant the man a heart
it happened that on the day before princetown pony fair neds groom fell ill and had to keep his bed but twenty ponies were already at princetown
only humphrey and his man knew their exact value and the market promised to be unusually good
his stock represented several hundred pounds for ned bred a special strain possessing the dartmoor stamina with added qualities of speed and style
the irony of chance ordained that one who despised all sport should produce some of the best polo ponies in the west of england
ned saw nothing for it but to sell by deputy at loss or withdraw his stock from the fair
he debated the point with mrs susan and her commonsense revealed an alternative
lord man alive what are you frightened of
she asked
cant you go up along like any other chap with to sell and get rid of your beasts yourself
you did use to do it thirty year ago and nobody was any the worse i believe
he stared at her
go in a crowd like that and barter my things like a huckster
well why not
only made of flesh and bone like
you wont melt away
tis just because you always avoid em that they think you give yourself airs and reckon they bant good enough company for you
i dont avoid em
yes you do
but not the only honest man in the world though sometimes you think you are
and if youd ope your eyes wider youd find a plenty others
for my part if i was paid for it i couldnt number more rogues in shaugh than i can count upon the fingers of both hands
to go up myself
whod believe it was me if they saw me
they want your ponies not you and when it came to paying the price of the ponies theyd soon know twas you then
i suppose you think i charge too much
like your impudence
are you going
he asked
why of course im going
tis my only out for the year
theyll fancy tis the end of the world up at duchy inn if i come along and take my place at the ordinary
no they wont theyll be a deal too busy to trouble about you
you go master and youll stand a lot better in your own eyes for going
twill be a great adventure in your life
a deal too much up on the hill there along with the foxes and other wild things and you know it
i havent the cut for a revel
tis nonsense to think of my going up
to think of it cant do no harm anyway she said
you think and think and youll find tis your duty as a sensible creature to go
not my duty
twill hurt none if i stay away
twill hurt your pocket
you know right well tis the proper thing that you go
and if you do ill ax for a fairing
and if you get me one ill get you one
you can put off old age like a garment and be a girl again he said
so i can then
tis your brother sets that wise fashion not you
hes as lively as a kitten when theres a frolic in the air
and so be all
you should have seen me at market in my youth
he did not answer but the next morning he appeared and clad for the fair
well done you
cried mrs susan
be you going to drive the black gig
i was riding up in the along with mr timothys from but you can come with me if you please
all and tis offering to im going through with the job now
and mind you dont take too much liquor up there
i know your ways when you get with a lot of silly people
they started presently and humphrey made sour remarks at the expense of susans bonnet
then by steep ascent and descent they went their way and fell in with other folk also bound for the festivity
some they passed and some passed them
cora and ned drove together in a flashy and the sight of cora brought a cloud upon ned
she was soon gone however
the lofty vehicle slipped by with a glitter of wheels a puff of dust a shout from ned as he lifted his whip hand and a flutter of pale pink and blue where cora sat in her finery
heartless minx
growled the old man
a parrot and a
no loss to the world if that pair was to break their necks together
dont you tell such speeches as that theres a good man answered mrs susan
the mischief with your sort is that you be always crying out nasty things you dont think which is just the opposite of us sensible people as only think the nasty things but take very good care for our credits sake not to say em
none like you for barking and them as hear you bark take it for granted you bite as well
and when i tell em you dont bite they wont believe it
take care i never bite you for so much plain speaking he said and ill thank you to lay hold on the reins while we walk up this hill for i want to read a letter
tis about the ponies from a buyer
he read and mrs susan drove
they traversed the miles of moorland at a slow pace and not a few who passed them displayed surprise at the spectacle of ned on his way to the fair
at devils bridge beneath the last long hill into princetown a vehicle from shaugh overtook them and the coras appeared
heathman was driving and beside him sat his mother while at the back of the cart were nathan ned and phyllis cora

wonders never cease
cried the publican
good luck and long life to you humphrey
now i couldnt have seen a better sight than this
hold on
i want to have a talk afore the fair
if you want to talk ill and you do the same said nathans brother
the women can drive on and well walk into princetown
priscilla cora and mrs susan kept their places and drove slowly up the hill side by side but not before nat had susan and applauded her holiday bonnet
heathman and his sister walked on together the brothers remained behind
the younger was in uproarious mood
he laughed and and congratulated humphrey on his courage in thus coming among the people
none would have recognised in this jovial spirit that man who walked not long before with a woman in north wood and moved heavily under the burdens of sickness and of care
but to nathan belonged the art of dropping lifes load occasionally and proceeding awhile in freedom
he felt physically a little better and intended to enjoy himself today to the best of his power
resolutely he banished the dark clouds from his horizon and let laughter and pleasure possess him
hows your throat
asked humphrey
you dont look amiss but they tell me youre not well
i hope it may mend
tis up and down with me
i cant talk so loud as once i could and i cant eat easy but whats the odds as long as i can drink
im all right and shall be perfectly well again soon no doubt
and in the name of wonder brings you to a revel
my ponies
theres twenty and all extra good
chapman goes and falls ill after the ponies was brought up here
the fool would bring em though theres no need
buyers are very well content to come to my paddocks
but custom is a tyrant to the old and if i didnt send to the sales chapman would think something had gone wrong with the world
im right glad youre here and i hope tis the beginning of more about for you
tis men like you and me that lend weight to these meetings
we ought to go
tis our duty
youre better pleased with yourself than i am as usual
we ought to be pleased answered the other
we are the salt of the rock that society is built on
glad youre so well satisfied
not with myself specially but im very well pleased with my class and the older i grow the better i think of it
people be like yonder at the top and dirt at the bottom declared humphrey
the sweet water is in the middle and the useful part of the people be the middle part
in a way yes
we of the lower are the backbone the nation has to depend on us but im not for saying the swells havent their uses
only theyd be nought without us
it takes all sorts to make a world
but leave that
i bant up here to talk politics
what does doctor say about your throat
leave that too
im not here to talk about my health
i want to forget it for a few hours
the wedding is on my mind just now
mrs cora and her daughter intend it to be a bit out of the common and so do i
but the brides mothers set on it taking place at our chapel and hester wants it to be at church
ned dont care a rush of course
it ought to be at church
dont see any pressing reason
toss up i say
you should know better than to talk like that
you dissenters no arguments humphrey
but all the same they must be married in church or chapel and since theres such a division of anxious to see ned married
tis more than time and certainly no fault of his that they didnt join sooner
but cora had her own ideas and oblige me by not naming either of them
you cant expect me to be interested
even if they were different from what they are i should remember the cruel past too keenly to feel anything good towards either of them
let the past go
youre too wise a man to harbour unkind thoughts against headstrong youth
let em be happy while they can
theyll have their troubles presently like the rest of us
theyll have what theyre brewing no doubt
empty heartless will say it feel as you may for cora
i hope youll live to see her better part
shes a sensible woman and a loving one for all you think not
at any rate youll come and see them married humphrey
you can ask me such a thing
let bygones be bygones
what was it you wanted to speak to me about
just thatthe wedding
i must make it a personal matter
i attach a good deal of importance to it
im very interested in the up in them wouldnt be too strong a word for it
ill confess to you that the mother is a good deal to best friend in this world
i owe a lot of my happiness to her
shes made my life less lonely and often said the word in season
you know what a wise woman can be you was married yourself
humphrey did not answer and his brother spoke again
theres only us two left and me
you might pleasure me in this matter and come
somehow its grown to be a feeling with me that your absence will mar all
stuff
ive been the at too many feasts in our family
in a word i wont do it
i wont be there
i dont approve of either of em and ive not interest enough in em now to take me across the road to see them
if youll come the marriage shall be in church
priscilla will agree if i press it
i cant offer more than that
i wont come so leave it
nathans high spirits sank for a little while then princetown was reached and he left his brother and strove to put this pain from him for the present as he had banished all other sources of tribulation
he was soon shaking hands with his acquaintance and making merry among many friends
but humphrey proceeded to the place where his ponies were stalled and immediately began to transact business with those who were waiting for him
chapter viii gipsy blood runs thin in england today but a trickle shall be found to survive among the people of the booth and caravan and glimpses of a veritable romany spirit may yet be enjoyed at lesser fairs and revels throughout the country
by their levity and insolence by their quick heels and dark faces by the artist in them by their love of beauty and of music by their skill to charm money from the pockets of the folk and by their nimble wits you shall know them
a few mongrels of the race annually find princetown and upon days of revel may there be seen at and roundabouts
here they are the spectators and cajoling pennies from young and old here astounding the people by their lack of here singing or dancing here here driving hard bargains for the local ponies here changing their doubtful coins for good ones or raising strife between folk and prospering from the quarrels of honest men after the manner of their kind
two streams of holidaymakers drifted through each other and through the little fair
they passed up and down the solitary street and greeted friends listened to the din of the music to the altercations of the customers and salesmen to the ceaseless laughter of children and of the ponies
on either side of that open space spread in the village midst an array of carts had been drawn up and against these barricades were tethered various animals which the vehicles had brought
they stood or reposed on litter of fern and straw cast down for them
here were pigs and black and great rams in a panting row
amid the brutes farmers and their men
the air was full of the smell of live mutton and swine and among stopping in thoughtful knots arguing and laughing heavily the came and went
the rams and dribbled and showed in a dozen ways their hatred of this publicity the pigs cared not but exhibited a stoic patience
upon the beside the road stood separate clusters of guarded ponies
old and young they were and ungainly white black and brown with their long manes and tails often bleached to a rusty pallor by the wind and sun
in agitated groups the little creatures stood
company cried to company with equine language and the air was full of their uttered in protests or sudden angry explosions
occasionally a new drove from afar would arrive and trot to its place in double and treble passing of black and bright russet or dull brown with foam of tossing manes flash of frightened eyes and soft thud and thunder of many hoofs
the people now came close now scattered before a pair of uplifted heels where a pony out of fear showed temper
the exhibits were very unequal
here a prosperous man marshalled a dozen colts here his humbler neighbour could bring but three or four to market
sometimes the group consisted of no more than a mare and foal at foot
round about were children who from far off had ridden some solitary pony to the fair and hoped that they might get the appointed price and carry money home to their parents or
hanging close on every side to the main business and thrusting in where space offered for a stall rows of small booths sprang up while beyond them on waste land stood the spinning to bray of organs the the beast show and the arena where were lifted on posts against a cloth
here worked the wanderers and played their parts with shout and song but at the heart of the fair more serious merchants stood above their varied wares and with unequal skill and subtlety won purchasers
these men displayed divergent methods all based on practical experience of human nature
a and defiant spirit sold braces and leather thongs and buckles
his art was to pretend the utmost indifference to his audience he seemed not to care whether they purchased his goods or no yet let it be clearly understood that none but a fool would miss the opportunities he offered
a over against the relied upon humour and sleight of hand
he sold watches that he asserted to be gold but he was also prepared to furnish clocks of baser metal for more modest purses
he dwelt upon the quality of the goods and defied his audience to find within the width and breadth of the united kingdom such machinery at such a price
he explained also very fully that he proposed to return among them next year with a special purpose to make good any defective timepieces that might by evil chance lurk unsuspected amid his stock
he reminded them he had been among them during the previous year also as a guarantee of his good faith
beyond him a big brown sold herb pills and relied upon a pulpit manner for his success
he came with a message of physical salvation from the god of the christians
he mingled dietetics and dogma he prayed openly he showed emotion he spoke of nature and the power above nature he called his maker to witness that nothing but the herbs of the field had gone to make his medicine
he had good store of long words with which to comfort rustic ears
he spoke of a palliative a and a panacea
he wanted but threepence for each box and asserted that the blessing of the lord accompanied his physic
why am i here
he asked
who sent me
i tell you men and women that god sent me
we must not carry our light under a bushel
we must not hide a secret that will turn a million unhappy men and women into a million happy men and women
god gave me this secret and though i would much sooner be sitting at home in my luxurious surroundings which have come to me as the result of selling this blessed corrective of all ills of the digestion and alimentary canals world is no place for idleness and laziness
so i am here with my pills and i shall do my masters work so long as i have hands to make the medicine and a voice to proclaim it
and in christs own blessed words i can say that where two or three just persons are gathered together there am i in the midst of them my am i in the midst of them
amid the welter of dun and grey there flashed yellow or scarlet where certain italian women moved in the crowd
they sold trinkets or offered to tell fortunes with the aid of little green parakeets in cages
the blare and grunt of coarse melody persisted and the people at the booths ceaselessly where they sold their sweetmeats cakes and fruit
some were anchored under little awnings some moved their goods about on wheels with flags fluttering to attract attention
old and young the maze
every manner of man was gathered here
aged and youthful and young grey and white black and brown bearded and shorn all came and went together
some passed suspicious and moody some stood garrulous genial sanguine according to their fortunes or fancied fortunes in the matter of sale and barter
and later in the day by the various roads that stretch north south and west from princetown droves of ponies began to wend some with cheerful new masters many with gloomy owners who had nothing to show but their trouble for their pains
this spacious scene was hemmed in by a rim of waste and ragged hills while overhead the sky hung low and shredded mist
humphrey ned had sold his ponies in an hour and was preparing to make a swift departure when accident threw him into the heart of a disturbance and opened the way to significant incidents
the old man met jack and was speaking with him but suddenly jack caught the other by his shoulders and pulled him aside just in time to escape being knocked over
a dozen overdriven bullocks past them with sweating flanks and dripping mouths
behind came two drovers and a brace of barking dogs hung upon the flanks of the weary and frightened cattle
suddenly as the people parted a big brute dazed and maddened by the yelping dogs now at his throat now at his heels turned and dashed into the open gate of a cottage by the way
the door of the dwelling stood open and before man or sheepdog had time to turn him the bullock had rushed into the hawk_house
there was a crash within the yell of a child and the scream of a woman
then rose terrified from the bullock where it stood jammed in a passageway with two frantic dogs at its rear
a crowd collected and ned amazed himself by rushing forward and shouting a direction
get round somebody and ope the back door
a woman appeared at the cottage window with a screaming and bloody child in her arms
theres no way out theres no way out she cried
theres no door to the garden
get round get round
climb over the back wall repeated ned
then he turned to the woman
ope the window and come here you silly fool
he said
she obeyed and humphrey found the injured child was not much hurt save for a wound on its arm
men soon opened the rear door of the cottage and drove the bullock out of the hawk_house then they turned him round in the garden and drove him back again through the hawk_house into the street
the hysterical woman regarded ned as her saviour and refused to leave his side
the first drover offered her a shilling for the damage and the second stopped to wrangle with jack who blamed him forcibly
twas the dogs could see that he declared
were not to blame
the dogs cant pay you silly fool answered head
if you let loose a dog that dont know his business youve got to look out for the trouble he makes
tis the devils own luck for you as that child wasnt killed
and now you want to get out of it for nought
theres a pounds worth of smashed in there
the woman who was alone sent messengers for her husband but they failed to find him then she declared that ned should assess the amount of her claim and the people upheld her
thus most reluctantly he was thrust into a sort of prominence
you was the only one with sense to tell em what to do and so youd better finish your good job and fix the price of the breakages said jack
the man with the bullocks when satisfied that humphrey would be impartial and indifferent to either party agreed to this proposal and ned quite bewildered by such a sudden notoriety entered the cottage calculated the damage done and soon returned
youve got to pay ten shillings he said
your bullock upset a tray and smashed a terrible lot of glass and china
he also broke down four rails of the balusters and broke a lamp that hung over his head
the doctor will charge a shilling for seeing to the childs arm also
so thats the lowest figure in fairness
less it cant be
the drover cursed and swore at this
he was a poor man and would be ruined
his master would not pay and if the incident reached headquarters his work must certainly be taken from him
none offered to help and humphrey was firm
either pay and thank god youre out of it so easily he said or tell us where you come from
the drovers talked together and then they strove to bate the charges brought against them
their victim now grown calmer agreed to take seven shillings but ned would not hear of this
he insisted upon observance of his ruling and the man with the bullocks at length brought out a leather purse and counted from it seven shillings
to these his companion added three
then the leader flung the money on the ground and to accompaniment of laughter and hisses hastened after his stock
the cattle were not for princetown and soon both men and their cavalcade onward again into the peace and silence of a moor
they cursed themselves weary kicked the offending dog and with a brute instinct to revenge their mishap smote and bruised the head of the bullock responsible for this misfortune when it stopped to drink at a pool beside the road
humphrey ned won a full measure of applause on this occasion
he took himself off as swiftly as possible afterwards but words were spoken of approval and appreciation and he could not help hearing them
his heart grew hot within him
a man shouted after him good for the old hawk
before he had driven off nathan ned met him at the duchy hotel and strove to make him drink
a drop you must have along with me he said
why theres a dozen fellows in the street told me how you handled those drovers
you ought to have the commission of the peace thats what you ought to have
youre cut out for it
a lot of lunatics answered the elder
no presence of mind in fifty of em
nought was done by me
the job might have cost a life but it didnt so said
i wont drink
i must get back home
did the ponies go off well
very
if you see susan tell her ive gone
the old fools on one of they roundabouts i expect
and if she breaks it down she neednt come back to me for the damages
a joke
a joke from you
this is a day of wonders to be sure
cried nathan
now crown all and come along o me and well find the rest of the family and the coras and all have a together
but his brother was gone and nathan turned and rejoined a party of in the street
elsewhere mrs cora and mrs ned walked together
their hearts were not in the fair but they spoke of the pending marriage and hoped that a happy union was in store for ned and cora
the young couple themselves tasted such humble delights as the fair could offer but coras pleasure was represented by the side glances of other girls and she regarded the gathering as a mere theatre for her own display
ned left her now and again and then returned
each time he came back he lifted his hat to her and exhibited some new sign of possession
cora affected great airs and a play of eyebrow that impressed the other young women
she to walk round the fair and regarded this as a triumph until the man who sold watches marked her among his listeners observed her vanity and raised a laugh at her expense
then she lost her temper and declared her wish to depart
she was actually going when there came up milly and her husband rupert ned
ned whispered to his to save the situation if possible and milly with some tact and some good fortune managed to do so
cora smoothed her ruffled feathers and joined the rest of the family at the inn
there all partook of the special ordinary furnished on this great occasion to the countryside
in another quarter thomas and their friends took pleasure after their fashion
every man won some sort of satisfaction from the fair and held his day as well spent
perhaps few could have explained what drew them thither or kept them for many hours wandering up and down now drinking now watching the events of the fair now eating now drinking again
but so the day passed with most among them and not until evening darkened did the mist thicken into rain and seriously damp the proceedings
humphrey ned well pleased with his sales and even better pleased with the trivial incident of the bullock went his way homeward and was glad to be gone
his state of mind was such that he gave alms to two mournful men limping slowly on crutches into princetown
each of these wounded creatures had lost a leg and one lacked an arm also
they dragged along a little that played hymns and their faces were thin anxious
these men stopped ned but not to beg
they desired to know the distance yet left to traverse before they reached the fair
we set out afore light from but we didnt know what a terrible road twas said one
you see with but a pair o legs between us we cant travel very fast
humphrey considered and his heart being uplifted above its customary level of caution he acted with most unusual impulse and served these maimed musicians in a manner that astounded them
his only terror was that somebody might mark the deed but this did not happen and he accomplished his charity unseen
its up this hill he said but the hills a steep one and the fair will be half over afore you get there at this gait
the men shrugged their shoulders and prepared to stump on
get in said ned
get in the pair of you and ill run you to the top
he alighted and helped them to lift their organ up behind while they thanked him to the best of their power
they talked and he listened as he drove them and outside the village on level ground he dropped them again and gave them
much heartened and too astonished to display great gratitude they crawled upon their way while humphrey turned again
the taste of the giving was good to the old man and its flavour astonished him
he overtook the drovers and their cattle presently and it struck him that this company it was who had made the day so remarkable for him
he half determined with himself to stop and speak with them and even restore the money he had exacted for well he knew the gravity of their loss
but unfortunately for themselves the twain little guessed what was in his mind they still from their disaster and when they saw the cause of it they swore at him shook their fists and threatened to do him evil if opportunity offered
whereupon ned hardened his heart kept his money in his pocket and drove forward
chapter ix the sensitive cora could endure no shadow of ridicule
to laugh at her was to anger her for she took herself too seriously the common error of those who do not take their seriously enough
when therefore she committed a stupid error and ned her about it there sprang up a quarrel between them and cora in her wounded dignity even went so far as to talk of postponing marriage
nathan ned explained the complication to a full bar and when he had done so the tide of opinion set somewhat against neds future bride
you must know that phyllis cora has gone away from home and last thing she did before she went was to ask cora to look after a nice little lot of young ducks that belonged to her and were coming forward very hopeful
of course cora said she would and one day mentioning it to my nephew ruperts wife milly told her that the heads of nettles well chopped up were splendid food for young ducks
wishful to please phyllis and bring on the birds what does cora do but busy herself for em
she gets the and chops em up and gives em to the ducklings and of course the poor wretches all sting their throats and suffocate themselves
for why
because she let em have the food raw
we all know she ought to have boiled the nettles
and a good few have laughed at her about it and made her a bit savage
thats no reason surely why she should quarrel with her sweetheart
his fault declared jack who was in the bar
none in the world but ned joked her and made her rather snappy
in fact he went on a bit too long
you can easily a thing like that
and none of us like a joke at our expense to be pushed too far
it shows what a clever woman she is all the same declared mr joe_voysey for when ned poked fun at her first which he did coming out of church on sunday i was by and heard her
what think she said
you dont boil thistles for a donkey says she so how was anybody to know you boil nettles for a duck
pretty peart
so it was declared nathan
very sharp and a good argument for that matter
ive bought phyllis a dozen new birds and nothing more need come of it but neds a bit of a fool here and there and he hadnt the sense to let well alone and now shes turned on him
hell fetch her round a chap so clever with the girls as him said joe_voysey whereupon timothy timothy who was of the company laughed scornfully
how can that man be clever at anything
he asked
heres his own uncle
be ned clever at anything on gods earth but spending money ned
come now
an honest answer
yes replied nathan promptly
he was never known to fall off a horse
the laugh rose against timothy for the farmers various abilities did not extend to horsemanship
he had been thrown a week before and still went a little lame
neds all right added jack
lazy no everybody else who can be
but hes generous and and no mans enemy
the girls a fool to keep him dangling
a little more of it and ill not meddle in other peoples business
entered at this moment and saw his foe
do i hear john head saying that he dont meddle with other peoples business
asked the sexton
gin cold please
well well since when have head made that fine rule
drink your gin said jack and then have another
you bant worth talking to till youve got a drop of liquor in you
when youre tuned up ill answer you
hows dennis getting on
he must be a patient man or else a terrible weak one to have you still messing about the church
better you leave the church alone retorted thomas
youd pull down every church in the land if you could and if it wasnt for men like me as withstand your sort and defy you thered very soon be no law and order in the state
tis your blessed church where theres no law and order answered jack
the states all right so long as the liberals be in but a hawk_house divided against itself
you wont deny that
and thats the hobble you christians have come to
and so much the easier work for my sweep the whole quarrelsome boiling of you to the devil
stop there jack
cried ned
no religion in this bar and no politics
you know the rules
let him go on said mr_gollop
theres a bitter truth in what he says
were not shoulder to shoulder and none can pretend we are
take man
what did he say only this morning in vestry
mr_gollop he said the roots are being starved
if we dont get rain pretty quick therell be no nor neither
half a dozen raised their voices in support of this assertion
thats truth anyway declared timothy
never knew such a beastly drought at this season
even rain will not bring the crop up to average weight now
its beyond nature to do it
well hes going to pray for rain said mr_gollop
next sunday we shall ax for moderate rain and showers
well why not
asked nathan
thats what the mans there for surely
why not
because the glass is up pon top of everything and the winds in the east steady as a rock
thats why not
you dont want prayer to be turned into a laughingstock
we dont want our ministers to fly in the face of providence do we
to pray for rain at present be equally mad as to pray for snow
tis just courting failure
then this here man jack and other poisonous members will laugh like elijah when he on them false prophets and say our jehovah be asleep
not me answered head
tis your faith be asleep
youve given your side away properly now my bold hero
so youve got such a poor opinion of your jehovah that you reckon to ax him to take the wind out of the east be going too far
but youre right
your god cant do it
all the same denniss a better christian than you
you speak as a rank atheist jack said timothy timothy
and what sense there is in you is all spoiled because youre so fierce and sour
not from it
we was talking of jehovah i believe and theres no law against free speech now so ive a right to say my say without being called to order by you or any man
tom here dont trust his god to bring rain when the glass is set fair and i say that he be perfectly all
mr_gollop ought to have the faith that moves mountains no doubt but he hasnt
he cant help feeling terrible shaky when it comes to a challenge
thats the good my sides doing though he do swear at us
were making the people
faith have had a long run for its money
now were going to give works a bit of a show
dennis fawns on jehovah like a spaniel bitch and thinks that all this be going to soften the god of the stars
but if there was a god hed be made of sterner stuff than man makes him
we shouldnt get round him like a naughty boy round a weak father
in fact you might so well try to stop a runaway steamroller by offering it a as to come round a working god by offering him prayers
how you can stand this under your roof nathan im blessed if i know grumbled
tis very evil speaking and no good will come to you by it
light will shine even on this man afore the end declared the innkeeper
god will explain as much as is good for jack to know
he shows each of us as much as we can bear to he did moses
if jehovah was to shine too bright on the likes of head here hed dazzle the man and blind him
god will
thats what you said nat
then why dont he explain
im a reasonable man
im quite ready and willing to hear
but twill take god all his time to explain some of his tricks played on honest harmless humans
lets hear first why he let the snake into the garden at all to fool those two poor grownup children
you talk about original sin
tis a dirty lie against human nature
if youre in the right twas your god sent the tree under eves as if i put a bunch of poison berries in a babys hand and said you mustnt eat em and then left the rest to chance and an enemy
whod be blamed if the child ate and died
why i should
and jury would bring it in right too
look at your gods blackguard doings against all they peaceful people he set his precious jews against
shameful i call it
driving em out of their countries harrying em killing em by miracles because he the jews wasnt good men enough to do it
chosen people
a pretty choice
hes been judging us ever since he made us now lets judge him a bit and see what his games look like to the eyes of a decently taught board school boy
youll roast for this john head and well youll deserve it said
not i thomas
ive just as much right to crack a joke against your ugly jehovah as you would have to laugh at the tuft of feathers on the end of a pole that foreign savages might call god
theres not a pin to choose betwixt them and you
we can only hope youll have the light afore youve gone too far jack said nathan
youre getting up home to sixty and im sure i hope gods will rise up on your path afore you go much further
tis certainly time answered head
and if your gods in earnest and wants to put me right the sooner he begins the better for us my salvation and his credit
hes got his holy however argued mr_gollop
if i was him id not give myself a thought over the likes of you
good what i should say
if you was god for five minutes i wonder what youd do tom speculated
give me a new back i hope
thats the first favour i should ax
id catch you up into heaven
thats the kindest thing the almighty could do for you
but joe_voysey looked doubtful
if you was to wait till i the word be better he said
nobody wants to leave his job unfinished
a good brain gone to whats happened to you jack said nathan sadly
lord he only knows why you are allowed to think such thoughts
no doubt theres a reason for it since nought can happen without a reason but the why and wherefore are hid from us common men like much else thats puzzling
anyway we can stick to christians though youve got no use for god jack tis certain that gods got a use for you and there may be those among us who will live to see what that use is
well im ready for a whisper declared the freethinker
he wont have to tell me he only makes his meaning clear the first time
they talked a little longer and then heathman cora came among them
be jack here
he asked
the chimney to his hawk_house have took fire seemingly and policemans made a note of it
but twas pretty near out when i come by
hell
cried jack
thats another five shilling gone
he left hurriedly to the tune of laughter and failed to hear triumphant final argument
there
there
shouted the sexton
there in his everyday speech
he cant get away from it tis part of nature and a common as natural as heaven
and argue as he pleases the moment hes took out of himself the truth slips
well may he say hell
theres nobody living round here will ever have more cause to say it
and that hell find long afore i or another drop the clod on his bones
chapter x thanks more to the diplomacy of nathan ned than neds own skill in reconciliation cora forgave her lover and their marriage day was fixed
not a few noticed that the master of the white thorn held this union much to heart and indeed appeared more interested in its achievement than any other save ned himself
a change had come over nathan and his strength failed him
the affection of his throat gained upon him and his voice grew weaker
he resented allusions to the fact and declared that he was well
only his doctor and priscilla cora knew the truth and only she understood that much more than physical tribulation was responsible for the innkeepers feverish activity of mind and energy poured forth in secret upon affairs
the extent of this immense diligence and devotion was hidden even from her
she supposed that a temporary cloud had passed away and she ceased not therefore from begging him to save his powers and so afford himself an opportunity to recover
but the man believed that he was doomed and suspected that his life could only be held upon uncertain tenure of months
the doctor would not go so far as this gloomy opinion yet he did not deny that it might be justified
nathan felt no doubt in his own mind and he believed that coras wedding was the last considerable event of a personal and precious nature that he could hope to see accomplished
afterwards but not until he found himself upon his deathbed the innkeeper designed a confession
circumstances and justice as he conceived it must make this avowal private but those most interested were destined to know the hidden truth concerning themselves
he had debated the matter with priscilla since decision rested with her but she was of his mind and indeed had been the first to suggest this course
coras shopping roused all the of to a high pitch of exasperation
much to the girls surprise her mother produced fifty pounds for a wedding outfit and the bride employed agreeable days in plymouth while she expended this handsome gift
a hawk_house had been taken at plympton
the face of it was genteel in coras estimation but the back was not
however the rear premises satisfied ned and its position with respect to town and country suited them both
there remained contracts and settlements in which nathan ned represented both parties
ned was generous and indifferent cora exhibited interest and a faculty for grasping details
she told herself that it was only reasonable and wise to do so
at any time the reckless ned might break his neck at any time the amorous ned might find her not
no sentiment obscured coras outlook
she astounded nathan ned by the shrewdness of her stipulations
few prophesied much joy of this marriage and even priscilla albeit nathan was impatient at her doubts none the less entertained misgivings
she knew the truth of her daughter and had long since learned the truth concerning young ned
those who desired to comfort her foretold that man and wife would go each their own way and mind each their own business and pleasure
not the most sanguine pretended to suppose that ned and cora would unite in any bonds of close and durable affection
the mans mother trusted that coras commonsense and practical spirit might serve as a steady strain to curb his nature but may ned was the only living soul who out of her warm heart and trusting disposition put faith in his marriage to lift her brother toward a and steadfast position in the ranks of men
at the subject of the wedding might not be mentioned
in consequence renewed coolness had arisen between the brothers
then came a rumour to humphreys ear that nathan was ill and he felt concern
the old man had no eye to mark physical changes
he was slow to discern moods or read the differences of facial expression begot by mental trouble on the one hand and bodily suffering on the other
now greatly to his surprise he heard that nathan began to be very seriously indisposed
the news came to him one morning a month before coras wedding
heathman cora called upon the subject of a stallion and mentioned casually that humphreys brother had lost his voice and might never regain it
tis terrible queer in the bar at the white thorn not to hear him and to know we never may no more he said
hes gone down and down very gradual but now he can only whisper
tis a thing to lose the power of a living death you might say
when did this happen
ive marked no change though tis a good few weeks now since i spoke with him
it gradual poor chap
humphrey rose and prepared on the instant to start for shaugh
i must see the man he said
were out for the minute owing to this wedding
but since hes fallen ill i must go to him
well hope tis of no account
they set out together and heathman was mildly surprised to learn the others ignorance
he keeps it so close but you cant hide your face
weve all marked it
the beard of the mans grown so white as if the snow had settled on it and his cheeks be too
for my part i never felt nothing in life to make me go afore except when your son mark died but somehow nat ned be a part of the place and the best part
ive got a great feeling towards him
tis making us all very uncomfortable
especially my mother
he talks to her a lot feeling how more than common wise she be and she knows a lot about him
shes terrible down over it and in fact tis a bad job all round im afraid
humphreys answer was to quicken his pace
he kept it from me he replied
i suppose he thought i ought to have seen it for myself
or he might have wrongly fancied i didnt care
everybody a wonderful good sort as him
twill cast a gloom over this blessed wedding
i wish to god twas over and done wedding i its got to be
why do you wish that
because im sick of the thing and that baggage my sister
gods truth
to watch her getting ready
everythings got to go down afore her like the grass afore the scythe
you may work your fingers to the bone and never get a thank you
i had a row with her last night and she got lashing me with her tongue till i rose up and fetched her a damned hard box on the ear grown woman though she is
my word it tamed her too
there
i said
thats better than all the words in the dictionary
you keep your snakes tongue between your teeth i said
theres no answering her with words but if her husband has got a pinch of sense which he hasnt hell do well to give her a hiding at the start
it acted like a charm
1 selfish
dont want to hear nothing about that
theyre making their own bed and twill be uneasy lying said humphrey
leave them and talk of other things
very pleased answered cora
bant a subject im fond of
without cora would be a better place to live ini know that and i say it
and my mother knows it too though say it she wont
they talked on various subjects and heathman informed ned that he would soon be a
ruperts wife be going to have a the last news
i heard it at the white thorn
is that so
they might have told me youd think
yet none has
they kept it from me
holding it for a surprise or maybe they didnt think interest you
no doubt that was the reason answered humphrey
and then he spoke no more but worked his own thoughts into a ferment of jealous bitterness until the village was reached
arrived he took no leave of heathman but forgot his presence and hastened to the inn
nathan was standing at the door in his apron and the brothers entered together
whats this i hear
said humphrey as they entered the others private chamber
well im ill to be frank
in fact very ill
id hoped to hide it up till after the wedding but my voice has pretty well gone you see
gone for good
youll never hear it again
but that wont trouble you
i should have marked something wrong when last we met no doubt
but you angered me a bit and angry men are like drunken ones their senses fail them
i didnt see or hear what had to you
now i look and listen i mark youre bad
what does the doctor say
tis what he dont say
but ive got it out of him
he took me to plymouth a month some very clever man there
ive talked such a lot in my life that i deserve to be struck a chatterbox as i have been
is that all
for the present
we neednt go beyond that
i shall soon get used to listening instead of talking
maybe ill grow wiser for it
that wasnt all they told you
nathan looked round and shut the door which stood ajar behind them
theres no hiding anything from you that you want to find out
as a matter of fact im booked
i know it
tis only a question or many
they give me time to put things as straight as i can
so like as not they lie
youll do better to go off to london while you may and get the best opinion up there
i would if twas only to pleasure you
but thats no use now
can you let down your food easy
nathan shook his head
i dare not eat in company no more he said its here
he put his hand to his throat and then drew it down
you dont suffer i hope
nathan nodded
i can tell you but i trust you not to let it out to any soul
we must have the wedding off cheerful and bright
i shall keep going till then if im careful
only a month now
you ought to be lying up close and never put your nose out this coarse weather
time enough
leave it now
im all right
ive had a good than you might think for
i wish for my sake and knowing that ive got my end in sight youd do the last thing you can for me and countenance this wedding
perhaps ive no right to ask but if you you knew how hard life can be when the flesh gives way and theres such a lot left to do and think about
if you only knew you say the last thing i can do for you
are you sure of that
a strange and yearning expression crossed the face of the younger man
he stroked his beard nervously and humphrey now awake to physical accidents marked that his hands were grown very thin and his skin had taken on it a yellowish tinge of colour
there was silence between them for some moments
then nathan shook his head and forced a smile upon his face
nothing at all
but its no small thing that i ask
i know that
youve a right to feel little affection for either of or cora
but my case is different
coras mother again he stopped but humphrey did not speak
coras mother has been a good friend to me in many ways
she is a clever woman and can keep her own counsel
theres more of priscilla cora in cora than you might think
youll never know how terribly cora felt marks death but she did
only she hid it close
as to ned he began to cough and suffered evident pain in the process
when the cough ceased it was some time before he could speak
then to humphreys discomfort his brother began to weep
he said as one talks to a child
what i can do ill do
god knows this is a harsh shock to me
i didnt dream of such a thing overtaking you
how old are you
in my year
hope despite em
they dont know everything
pray to the almighty about it
youre weak
you ought to drink if you cant eat
ill come to the wedding and ill give the woman a your sake and her for her own
nathan now unnerved could not reply
but he took his brothers hand and held it
god bless you for this he whispered
if you could but understand me better and believe that with all my black faults ive meant well i should die easier humphrey
dont talk about dying
youre a bit low
i havent forgotten when mark went
now tis my turn
why dont you trust me
you never trusted me humphrey
the other darted a glance and nathans eyes fell
you were right not to he added
humphrey rose
im your brother and your friend
i cant be different to what i am
i dont respect did
silly word most times but ill use iti love you well enough
why shouldnt i
youre my ive got left
im cut up about this
i wish i could lighten your load and im willing to do it if tis in my power
you have
if you come to that wedding i shall die a happy man
thats nought
bant there anything deeper i can you yourself and your peace of mind
again nathan struggled with his desires
but pride kept him silent
he could not tell the truth
no he answered at last
nothing for me myself
or for any other
the innkeeper became agitated
no no
youve done a good days work
no more for the present
ive not thrown up the sponge yet
will you take a glass of the old sloe gin before you go
humphrey shook his head
not for me
the wedding
third of november
i shall be there and will have a letter from me next week
you make me a happier man than you know humphrey
let it rest then
ill see you again o sunday
they parted and while one put on his hat and hastened with tremulous excitement to the other breasted the hill and buttoned his coat to the wind which sent leaves flying in wild companies at the spinney edge by corner
the sick man rejoiced upon his way the hale man went
i can do no more said humphrey to himself
hes a ned despite the grip of death on him
perhaps i was a fool to tell him i didnt respect him
hell think of it again when hes got time for thought by night and twill rasp home
following upon this incident it seemed for a season that nathans health mended
his disease delayed a little upon its progress and he even hoped in secret that his brother might be right and the physicians wrong
he flashed with a spark of his old fire
he whispered jokes that woke noisy laughter
in secret he ticked off the days that remained before ned and cora should be married
it wanted less than a fortnight to the event and all was in readiness for it
humphrey ned had sent cora twenty pounds and she had visited him and thanked him personally for his goodness
the old man had also seen ned and although his nephew heard few compliments and came from the interview in a very indignant frame of mind yet it was felt to be well that humphrey had thus openly suffered the past to be obliterated
then came a midnight when priscilla cora lying awake and full of anxious thoughts heard upon the silence a sound
at first she believed it to be the four feet of some wandering horse as he struck the ground with his hoofs in leisurely fashion and slowly passed along the deserted road then she perceived that it was the two feet of a man moving briskly and carrying him swiftly forward
the feet stopped the outer wicket gate was opened and some one came to the door
priscillas window looked forth from a thatched dormer above and now she threw it up and leant out
she knew by intuition the name of the man below
is that you jim
she asked

masters took cruel bad and cant fetch his breath
he knocked me up and i went first for mr_gollop who was to home luckily
then i for you
mrs cora was already putting on her clothes
youd best to go back she said
ill be up over at once after ive up my son and sent him riding for doctor
fifteen minutes later heathman still half asleep on a pony through a rainy night for medical help and his mother hastened up to the white thorn and her heart for what she might find there
she had long learned to conceal all emotion of spirit and she knew that under no possible stress of grief or terror would truth have power to escape the prison of her heart
chapter xi the accident of a heavy cold had suddenly aggravated the morbid condition of nathan neds throat and set all doubt of the truth at rest
often on previous occasions he had anticipated death at short notice and prepared to face it but now he trusted fate not to deal the final blow before his daughters marriage
his only concern was to be on his feet again swiftly that none of the plans for the wedding should be changed
the doctor warned him that he was very ill and took the gravest view of his condition but nathan out of a sanguine heart declared that he would make at least a transient recovery
he obeyed the medical mans directions very carefully however he kept his bed and put himself into the hands of the parish nurse
in sombre triumph she came to this important case and brought with her certain errors of judgment and idiosyncrasies of character that went far to counterbalance real ability begot of experience
she was a good nurse but an obstinate and foolish woman
no more conscientious creature ruled a sick room or obeyed a doctors mandate but she added to her prescribed duties certain gratuitous moral ministrations which were not required by science or demanded by reason
mrs cora saw ned often and sometimes shared the night watches with mr_gollop mr_gollop
the latter viewed her attentions to nathan and her emotion before his suffering with a suspicious eye
but she reserved comment until after the end
the case was not likely to be a long one in her opinion
for one week little happened of a definite character and during that time nathan ned saw his relations and several of his more intimate friends
then ensued a malignant change and at the dawn of this deterioration after the doctor had left him mr_gollop sat alone with her patient and endeavoured to elevate his emotions
ive flashed a bit of light on a wandering soul at many a deathbed she declared and i hope i shall be spared to do so at many more
theres not a few men and women that wouldnt hear me in health but they listened meek as worms when the end was in sight and they hadnt strength left to move an eyelash
thats the time to drive truth home ned and ive done it
but always cheerful mind
im not the sort to give up hoping
im sure not he whispered
wasnt christs first and last message hope
dont you talk
let me do the talking
yes twas hope he brought into this hopeless world
but even hope can be trusted too much
you must put your hope in the next world now not in this one im afraid
did he say so
knew he would
death was in his eyes when he went out of your chamber
still theres plenty of time
things may mend
hes going to send a new physic
whats the good of that if ive got to go
youll know presently my poor man
tis to ease what be bound to creep over you later on
bodily pains nought
havent i suffered all that man can suffer
no you yet
dont talk about that part
you shant suffer while im if i can help it in reason and under doctors orders
but i wont stray beyond them i was never known to take anything upon myself like some of they hospital that call themselves nurses do
when is mrs cora coming
lips tightened
very soon without a doubt though why i cant say
listen to me a little afore shes here
tis my duty to say these things to you and youre not one that ever stood between man or woman and their duty
ill not see them married now
thats cruel hard after how can you say that
you may be there in the spirit if not in the flesh
i suppose you bant one of they godless ones that say ghosts dont walk
havent i beheld em with these eyes
didnt i go down to mrs at shaugh bridge in the of the evening two year ago and didnt i see a coming along out of they there
tis well known i seed it and if it werent the spirit of abraham vosper as worked there for fifty year and then was run over by his own team of and fractured to death in five places whose spirit was it
so you may be at your nephews wedding with the best and for my part i shall know you be there and feel none the less cheerful for it
so much to many to no strength and no time he said
the air was dark and hurtling with awful wings for nathan ned
he heard and saw the storm coming
but others would feel it
he was safe from the actual hurricane but by anticipation dreadfully he endured it now
death would be no release save from physical disaster
his place was with the living not with the dead
cruelly the living must need him presently the dead had no need of him
mr_gollop supposed that she read her patients heart
tis your own soul you must seek to save ned
none can save our souls but ourselves
and as for time thanks to the rivers of blood christ shed theres always time for a dip in em
youre well thought on
but thats nought
tis the birdseye view the almighty takes that will decide
and our conscience tells us what that views like to be
tis a good sign you be shaken about it
the best sort generally are
ive seen an evil liver go to his doom like a dropping asleep off its mothers nipple and ive seen a pious saint such as my own father was get into a terrible tear at the finish as if he seed all the devils in hell up against his coming
she ministered to the sick man then sat down and on again
but he was not listening his strength had nearly gone his gaiety had vanished for ever
not a smile was left
the next world at this juncture looked vain and futile
he cared not a straw about it
he was only concerned with his present environment and the significance of passing from it at this juncture
run run out
he whispered to himself
would there be no final parenthesis of strength to deal with the manifold matters now tumbling to chaos
was the end so near
he brushed aside lesser things and began to think of the one paramount obligation
why dont she come
why dont she come
he whispered but mr_gollop did not hear him
this was a sort of moment when she felt the call of her faith mighty upon her
she had often striven to drag a mans mind away from earth to the spectacle of heaven and the immense difficulty of winning it
how many have you got mr
ned
she asked abruptly and in a mechanical fashion he heard and answered her
here and four at at least they cant be called mine im afraid theyre all and youd give the lot for one little corner in a heavenly you mr
ned
no doubt he said
dont talk for a bit
im broken im terrible anxious i must see give me something to drink please
while she obeyed him mrs cora came in
the doctor who had perceived her tragic interest in the patient kept her closely informed of his condition and priscilla had learned within the hour that nathan was growing worse
now she came and ned asked mr_gollop to leave them
i cant think why murmured mr_gollop
im not generally told to go out except afore relations
still i can take my walk now instead of this afternoon
and if the new physic comes dont you give him none mrs cora please
tis very powerful and dangerous and only for skilled hands to handle
neither spoke until the nurse had departed
and i shall be gone exactly twenty minutes and no more she said
ive got my reputation i believe if some of us havent but with chapel people the exact problem respecting chapel people she left unstated and in closing the door behind her made some unnecessary noise
then priscilla folded nathan in her arms and kissed him
he held her hand and shut his eyes while she talked but presently he roused himself and indicated that the confession to his children must not in safety be longer delayed
i dont feel particular worse though i had a bit of a fight for wind last night but i am worse and i may soon be a lot worse
theyd better all come afternoon
they shall she promised
if that was god if that was all priscilla
it is all that matters
tis the very least of it
wherever i turn
plots miscarried plans failed good intentions all gone astray
she thought that he wandered
dont talk tis bad for you
if youve got to go go you pity me without you
but you are all right such a steadfast man as you
the poor will call you blessed and your full tale of will never be told
thats
a dead mans motives dont count tis his deeds we rate him by
hes gone
he cant explain what he meant
pray for me to live a bit longer priscilla
beg em for their prayers at the chapel beg em for their prayers at church
im terrible terrible to go just now and thats truth
for those i those i leave
she calmed him and sought to banish his fears
but he entered upon a phase of mental excitement deepening to frenzy
he was bathed in sweat and staring before him when the nurse returned
after noon the man had regained his nerve and found himself ready for the ordeal
a dose of the new drug brought ease and peace
he was astonished and sanguine to feel such comfort
but his voice from the strain of the morning had almost become extinguished
when priscilla and his children came round him and the family were alone he bade the woman speak
tell them he said
im not feared to do it since you wish them to know but my throat is dumb
heathman stood at the bottom of the bed and his mother sat beside it
cora and phyllis were in chairs by the fire
they looked and saw mrs cora clasp her hands over nathan neds
the act inspired her and she met the astonished glances of her children
for all these years she said youve been kept without hearing the truth you three
you only knew i was a widow and that ned was a widower and that we were friends always and that he never married again because his dead wife didnt want him to
but theres more to know
after mrs ned died nathan here found me an orphan girl working for my living in a china and glass shop at bath
i hadnt a relation or friend in the world and he got to love me and he wanted to marry me
but i wouldnt have it because in honour to his wifes relations if hed married me hed have had to give up five thousand pound
and they would have taken very good care he did so
the law was his side but truth was against it since his wife gave him the money only if he didnt wed she couldnt enforce such a thing but he acted as if she could
i went to live with him and you three children were born
then a bit after he came back here and of course i came with him
hes your father but theres no call for any else to know it but us
i dont care and never shall care if everybody knows it
a better man wont breathe gods air in this world than your father and no woman have been blessed with a kinder husband in the eye of the almighty
but theres you three to think of and be against you if this was known now
he didnt even want to tell you but i was determined that you should know it afore either of us died
and now its pleased god to shorten your dear fathers days and youve got to hear that he is your father
there was a silence
i ask them to forgive me whispered nathan ned
i ask my son and my daughters to forgive me for what ive done
no need for that answered priscilla
lie down and be easy and dont get excited
he had sat up and was holding his beard and stroking it nervously
mrs cora shook his pillow and took his hand again
then she looked at her son who stood with his mouth open staring at the sick man
his expression indicated no dismay but immense astonishment
well im damned
he said
this beats cockfighting
you my father
and now going to drop when i might have been some use to you
there
what a thing to be sure
call him by his right name my sake heathman urged his mother
godi will for his own answered the man
i dont care a curse about such things as laws and all the rest of it
hes been a rare good sort all his life and no man could have a better father whichever side the blanket he was got
ill call him father and welcome and i wish to christ he wasnt going to die
heathman came and took nathans hand and his mother broke down at his words buried her face in the and wept
tell them to come over whispered ned to his son
and thank you and god bless you son
youve done more than you know to lighten a cruel load
come here you two and kiss your father said heathman
the girls came and first phyllis kissed nathan nervously and then the touch that he for rested a moment on his cheek
with coras kiss the tension subsided he sank back and priscilla drew the sheet up to his beard and again lifted the pillow
now i shall go in some sort of peace though an erring and a sinful man he murmured
if you can forgive me so will my saviour
and let this secret be a secret for ever
remember that all of you
tis beyond human power to make you legitimate neds but neds you are and please god will lead a better and wiser life than i have led
no need to tell anybody the truth
forgive your father and forget him so soon as ever you can but worship your mother your dying day worship her protect her and shield her and stand between her and the rough wind and be proud of having such a blessed brave woman for a mother
you neednt tell me that said heathman
the other stopped but held up his hand for silence
after a little rest he proceeded
the times coming when she will need all the love and wit youve got among you
tis no good talking much about that and i havent the human courage left to meet your hard faces or tears or frowns
all i say is forgive me and love your mother through thick and thin
all the blame is of it belongs to her
he held his hand out to cora
she was sitting on the edge of the bed looking out of the window
youll remember my cora he said
let me hear you call me father just you can bring yourself to do it
the money dear father
she asked
he smiled and it was the last time that he ever did so
like my sensible cora he answered
but he did not continue the subject
youd best all to go now declared priscilla
she rose and looked straight into the eyes of her children each in turn
the girls the son went to her and kissed her
dont you think this will make any difference to me said heathman
youre a damned sight too good a mother for me whether or noor for them women either and this man father i should about you for ill always put you afore anything else in the world
and so will i mother said phyllis
of course we all will added cora and the great thing must be for us all to keep as dumb as newts about it
never do for it to come mothers sake more than ours even
i dont say it for our sakes but for mothers sake and for fathers good name too
such wisdom
said nathan
youve all treated me better than i better
and god will reward you for such high forgiveness to a wicked wretch
ill see you all again once before i die
promise that
promise youll come again cora
i will come again she said and please father make mother promise on her oath to be quiet and sensible and not run no risks
if it got out never know
were above such small things but many people would cold shoulder us if they heard of it
you know what people are
her mother looked at her without love
the girl was excited she began to appreciate the significance of what she had heard her eyes were wet and her voice shook
ill be quiet and sensible cora said the mother
ive been quiet and sensible for a good many years i believe and i shant begin to be noisy and foolish now
youre quite safe
better you all go away now and leave us for the present
they departed silently and once below the girls crept off together like guilty things to their home while cora in the bar below and drank
he was perfectly indifferent to the serious side of his discovery and save for his mothers sake would have liked to tell the men in the bar all about it
he regarded it rather as a matter of congratulation than not
no spark of mercenary feeling touched his emotion
that he was a rich mans son had not yet occurred to him but that he was a good mans son and a popular mans son pleased him
mrs cora suffered no in his eyes
he felt wonder when he considered her power of hiding this secret for so many years and he experienced honest sorrow for her that the long clandestine union was now to end
the days event indeed merely added fuel to the flame of his affection for her
but it was otherwise with the sisters
phyllis usually took on the colour of coras thought and now the elder with no little examined the situation from every point of view
the only really bright side its got is that therell be plenty of money i suppose
id give a sovereign phyllis to see the will
funny it sounds to say father was always terrible fond of me and ive often wondered why for
now of course tis easy to explain
what about the wedding
asked phyllis
twill have to be cruel quiet now i suppose
certainly not answered her sister
twill have to be put off thats all
i wont have a little wedding smothered up in half mourning or some such thing but come to think of it we shant figure among the mourners in any we shall be among them really
twill be terrible difficult to help giving ourselves away over this
i think the best thing would be for mother to take the money and clear out and go and live somewhere further off the better
for that matter when the wills read everybody will guess how it is
heathman might go on with the
yes he might
but i hope hell do no such thing answered her sister
hes always the thorn in my side and always will be
dont know the meaning of the word decency
however hes not like to trouble us much when were married
i shant be sorry to change my name now phyllis
and the sooner you cease to be called cora too the better
about mother
i shouldnt presume to say a word about mother one way or the other answered cora
im not a fool and im not going to trouble myself about the things that other people do but all the same i shall be glad to get out of it and start with a clean slate among a different class of people
what amazing cleverness to hide it all their lives like that speculated phyllis
im sure us never would have been so clever as to do it
it became a habit no doubt
twas salt to their lives i reckon and made em all the fonder of each other declared cora
everyday married life must have looked terrible tame to what they did
their time was one long lovemaking in secret
im awful sorry for mother now though continued phyllis because when he dies she cant put on weeds and go and hear the funeral sermon and do all the things a proper widow does do
no admitted her sister that she certainly cant
shell have to hide the truth pretty close from this day forward thats very clear
she owes that to to you and i shall see she pays her debt
she will of course replied the other
shes a terrible brave woman and always has been
shell hide it up close close as we shall for that matter
the only one whos like to let it out
you know what a careless creature he is
cora frowned
i do she said
and i know theres no love lost between him and me
a coarse man he is and dont care what gutter he chooses his friends out of
take one thing with another it might be so well to marry ned at the appointed time and get it hard and fast
so they talked and heathman from the frosty standpoint of their own hearts
rather than bring one shadow on his mothers fame the brother of these girls would have bitten out his tongue and swallowed it
chapter xii nathan neds bedroom faced the south
a text was nailed upon the wall over his head and an old photograph of his father stood upon the mantelpiece
to right and left of this memorial appeared trinkets made of shells
a pair of old carriage lamps precious from association decorated either end of the
an old print of niagara falls that his mother had valued was nailed above it
a white curtain covered the window but there was no blind for this man always welcomed daylight
on the there languished a cactus in a pot
it was a gift under the will of an old dead woman who had tended it and cherished it for twenty years
one easy chair stood beside the bed and on a table at hand were food and medicine
many came to see the dying man and humphrey ned visited him twice or thrice in every week
more than once nathan had desired to speak of private matters to his brother but now he lacked the courage and soon all inclination to discuss mundane affairs departed from him
there followed a feverish week in which nathan only desired to listen to religious conversation
recorded promises of hope for the sinner were his penultimate interest on earth
he made use of a strange expression very often and desired again and again to hear the bible narrative that embraced it
this day shalt thou be with me in paradise he said to humphrey and to many others
i cling to that
it was spoken to a thief and a failure
all strove to comfort him but a great mental incubus haunted his declining hours
his old sanguine character seemed entirely to have perished and its place was taken by spirits of darkness and of terror
the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom he said to mr_gollop mr_gollop when she was alone with him
if id marked that better i might now have got beyond that stage and learned to love him
but im in life hasnt took me further than fearful still
no need in your case i hope so far as mortal man can say she answered
tis natural to be uneasy when the journeys end falls in sight and we all ought to be
but then comes christ and casts out fear
youve a right so far as man can say to trust him and fear nought
but man doesnt know
yet he forgave the dying thief
he did so though us have no right to say whether twas a bit of rare kindness in him or whether he made a practice of it
but for my part i steadfastly believe that he do forgive everything but the sin against the holy ghost
of course thats beyond his power and would never do
mrs cora spent much time at the white thorn and since her visits relieved mr_gollop of work she acquiesced in them while reserving the right of private judgment
priscilla and her children all saw the sufferer together more than once and then came a day when heathman cora and phyllis took their leave of him
the young man then secreted his emotion and roamed for an hour alone upon the moor the girls felt it but little
cora declared afterwards to phyllis that since this great confession had been made her mind dimly remembered her tender youth and a man in it
this man she had regarded as her father
all the children were deceived at an early age
they had indeed been led implicitly to suppose that their father died soon after the birth of phyllis
one last conversation with his brother humphrey long remembered
it was the final occasion on which nathan seemed acutely conscious and his uneasiness of mind clearly appeared
they were alone and the elder perceived that nathan desired and yet feared to make some statement of a personal character
that he might ease the others mind and open the way to any special conversation he desired ned uttered certain general speeches concerning their past their parents and the different characteristics of temperament that had belonged to vivian and themselves
we were all as opposite as men can be and looked at life opposite and set ourselves to win opposite good from it
who shall say which comes out best
on the whole perhaps vivian did
he died without a doubt
there are some men bound to be pretty happy through native stupidity and the lack of power to feel and there are some as high as happiness and glimpse content by the riches of their native wisdom
ive found the real fools and the real wise men both seem to be happy
a small brain keeps a man cheerful as a bird and a big one leads to whats higher than cheerfulness but tis the middle bulk of us be so often miserable
wem too witty to feed on the fools pap of ignorance and not witty enough to know the top of wisdom
i speak for myself in that but youve been a happy hopeful man all your days so after all youre wiser than i granted you to be
me wise
my god
dont you say that
my happiness was a fools happiness my laughter a fools laughter all the time
at all the time but at first
we do the mad things at the mad age and after when the bill comes into find us grown up and in our right curse nature for not giving us the brains first and the powers afterwards
mans days be a cruel knife in the hand of a child
too often the heedless wretch cuts afore hes learned how to handle it and carries the scar for ever
true for you
natures a terrible poor master as ive always said and always shall
we know it but who stands up between a young man and his youth to protect him therefrom
we old see em thinking the same vain things and doing the same vain things and burning their fingers and scorching their hearts at the same vain fires and we look on and grin like the idiots we are and make no effort to help em
not you you
you was always the young mans friend
you never was a young man yourself exactly
an old head on young shoulders you always carried and so did i
dont think of me
so
no man was madder than me none was none committed worse sins for others backs to bear
the best that any man will be able to say of me a month after im in my grave is that i meant well
and maybe not many will even say that
deaths no evil to me humphrey but dying now is a very cruel evil i assure you
the cloud lies behind not in front
so it does with every man struck down in the midst of his work
shall you write your own verse according to our old custom
the other shook his head
no
ill stick up no pious thought for men to spit upon when they pass my grave
id rather that no stone marked it
twill be one thats more than ever ill deserve
dont be downcast
leave afterwards to me
i think better of you for hearing you talk like this
you tried to brace me against the death of my son now ill brace you against your own death
you dont fear the thing and thats to the good
but like all busy men it finds you with a lot of threads tangled i suppose
thats the fate of every one who tries to do other peoples work besides his own and takes off the shoulders of others what properly belongs there
theyll have to look to their own affairs all round when you go
nathans answer was a groan and with the return of the nurse humphrey went away
from that hour the final phases of the illness began suffering dimmed the patients mind and turned his thoughts away from everything but his own physical struggle between the intervals of sleep
his torments increased his consciousness flinging over all else was reduced to its last earthly interest
he kept his eyes and his attention ceaselessly fixed upon one thing so long as his mind continued under his control
not grief at the past not concern at the future not the face of priscilla and not the touch of her hand absorbed his intelligence now but the sight of a small bottle that held the anodyne to his misery
that he steadfastly regarded and pointed impatiently to the clock upon the mantelpiece when the blessed hour of administration struck
the medicine was guarded jealously by mr_gollop mr_gollop and once when frenzied at the mans sufferings priscilla had sought to administer a dose the other woman came between and sharply rebuked her
its death
she whispered under her voice
want to murder him
hes taking just what the doctor utmost limit
after three days of grief nathans brother became aware of the situation and perceived that the end
he debated on this horror for a night and next day spoke to the doctor
he put the case without evasion or obscurity and the professional man heard him in patience and explained at once his deep sympathy and his utter powerlessness to do more
hes grant that
certainly hes quicker the better now poor fellow
the glands are involved and the end must come tolerably soon
how long
impossible to say
a few days probably
he keeps his strength wonderfully well
but it would be better if he didnt
wouldnt it be better if he died tonight
all our sakes admitted the physician
cant you help him out of it then
impossible
why
youd do as much for a horse or dog
my business is to prolong life not hasten death
the profession recognises no interference of that sort
who knows anything about it
a dying man dies and theres an end
i cannot listen to you ned
we must think of the greatest good and the greatest safety to the greatest number
the law is very definite in this matter and i have my profession to consider
you look at an individual case the law looks at the larger question of what is convenient for a state
your brother is having medicinal doses of morphia as often as it is possible to give them to him without danger to life
in fact nature must kill him her own hard way
much is being done to lessen his pain
but a double dose of your physic would end his life
how
he would become unconscious and in three or possibly four hours he would die
youd call that murder
that is the only name for it as the law stands
you wont do that
no ned
i wish i could help him
but in a word i have no power to do so
is it because you think be a wrong thing or because you know tis unlawful
asked the elder
you might say twas impertinent to ask it as it touches religion but im ignorant and old and want to know how it looks to the conscience of a learned man like that have been educated in all manner of deep subjects and the secrets of life
the doctor reflected
he was experienced and efficient but like many other professional men he had refused his reason any entrance into the arcanum of his religious opinions
these were of the customary nebulous character based on tradition on convention on the necessity for pleasing all in a general practice on the murmur of a mothers voice in his childhood
i am a christian he said
and i think it wrong to lessen by one moment the appointed life of any man
but not wrong to lengthen it
that we cannot do
then surely you cannot shorten it either
tell me this sir why would you poison a dog thats dying so that its misery may be ended
i will not argue about it
the cases are not parallel
common humanity would of course put a period to the agony of any unconscious beast
but wouldnt free an immortal soul from its perishing dirt
no
i am diminishing his pain enormously
i can do no more
remember ned that our lord and master healed the sick and restored the dead to life
he never shortened any mans days he prolonged them
im answered replied the elder
your conscience it should be on the side of the law
im answered but im not convinced
they parted and humphrey found the others argument not strong enough to satisfy him
he wrestled with the problem for some time and ere long his impression grew into a conviction his conviction ripened to a resolve
in the afternoon of that day he returned to the white thorn and found mrs cora with his brother
mr_gollop had gone out for a while
nathan appeared to be half unconscious but his mind clearly pursued some private train of thought
priscilla rose from her chair beside the bed and shook hands with humphrey
nathan spoke but not to them
a mighty man of valour
his burning words melted the wax in a mans ears i warn you melted the wax in a mans ears melted the wax oh christ help me
isnt it time for the medicine yet
he stared at the bottle
it was placed on a bracket in his sight
what did the doctor say today
asked humphrey
said it was strength
theres nothing to stop him living three or four days yet
want him to
my god no
do all a woman could do to end it
humphrey regarded her
will he come to his consciousness again
i asked the doctor the same question
he said he might but it was doubtful
the sick man groaned
agony had long stamped its impress on his face
when is he to have the medicine
when mr_gollop comes back she said
theres an hour yet
the lord knows what an hour is to me watching
what must it be to him
why it may be a lifetime to hima whole lifetime of torment yet before hes gone admitted humphrey
i pray to god day and night to take him
if i could only bear it for him
ned knelt beside his brother spoke loudly squeezed the sufferers hand and tried to rouse him
my physic mr_gollop for your humanity clocks heard iti my merciful maker why cant i have it
he in slow suffocation
ill give him his medicine said humphrey
this shant go on
shell make trouble if you do
i hope not and its no great matter if she does
he crossed the room examined the bottle took it to the light and poured out rather more than a double dose
he crossed the room with it heaved a long breath steadied himself and then put his arm round his brother and lifted him
here you are nat
youll sleep awhile after this
twill soon ease you
nathan ned seized the glass like one perishing of thirst and drank eagerly
he continued to talk a little afterwards but was swiftly easier
presently the drug silenced him and he lay still
humphrey looked at his watch
i can tell you he said
because youll understand
his troubles are ended for ever now
he wont have another pang
ive taken it upon myself
youre a wise and patient woman
youve got other secrets
better keep this with the rest
he was excited
his forehead grew wet and he mopped it with the sheet of the bed
priscilla did not reply but she went on her knees beside nathan and listened
at six oclock or maybe a bit earlier hell stop
till then hell sleep in peace
when does mr_gollop mr_gollop come back
after four
ill wait then
youre a brave man
many would do so much as that even for a brother
do as you would be done by covers it
tis a disgrace to the living that dying men should suffer worse terror and pain than dying beasts
terror they must perhaps since they can think but need for that
ill bless you for this to my own last day she said
she rose then and fetched a chair
she held nathans hand
he was insensible and breathing faintly but easily
suddenly mrs cora got up and hastened across the room to the medicine bottle
we must think of that she said
leave it
hes had enough
hes had too much she answered
theres the danger
when that woman comes back shell know to half a drop whats gone
she guessed the wish in me to do this very thing two days ago
she read it in my eyes i believe
and god knows the will was in my heart but i hadnt the courage
let her find out
her
matter but not her
priscilla took the bottle lifted it and let it fall upon the floor
it broke and the medicine was spilled
there she said
that will answer the purpose
you had given him his dose and putting the bottle back it broke
ill send heathman off quick to yelverton for another bottle so it shall be here before the next dose is due
then you wont be suspected
he listened and perceived how easily came the devious thought to her swift mind
it did not astonish him that she was skilled in the art to deceive
ive taken the of them he said
ive thought long about this
i neednt have told you to keep the secret for it cant be kept
and i dont want it to be kept really
you cant hide it from the nurse
shell know by the peace of poor nat here how it is
priscilla looked again
profound calm brooded over the busy man of shaugh
he was sinking out of life without one tremor
theres an awful side to it the woman murmured
there was he said
the awfulness was to see nature strangling him by inches
theres nought awful now but the awfulness of all death
tis meant to be an awful thing to the to the dying
for half an hour they sat silent
then priscilla lifted the clothes and put her hand to nathans feet
hes cold she said
cold or heat are all one to him now
a little later mr_gollop mr_gollop returned
she came at the exact hour for administration of the medicine and she sought the bottle before she took off her bonnet and cloak

she cried out
i gave him his physic a bit ago said ned
the bottle is broke
the nurse hurried to her patient and examined him closely
she perceived the change
hes dying
she said
so he was when you went away
she broke off and into anger
is wont stop in the hawk_house
you wicked woman
she turned upon mrs cora and poured out a torrent of invective
then humphrey took her by the shoulders and put her out of the room
you can go he said
youll not be wanted any more
she hastened from the inn and then went off to the vicarage as fast as her legs would carry her
another passed and none came to them
from time to time priscilla put her ear to nathans face
i dont think hes breathing any more she said
then came a noise and a grumbling of mens voices below
a violent strife of words clashed in the bar
the day had waned and it was growing dark
theyll be against you im fearing said priscilla
tis of no account
they always are
presently dennis dennis entered the room
i hear poor ned is going and they cant find his minister
can i be of any comfort to him
he made no allusion to the things that he had heard and humphrey did not immediately answer him
he was leaning over his brother
then he took out his watch opened it and put the polished inner case to nathans lips
light a candle and bring it here he said to priscilla
she obeyed and he examined the polished metal
no dead i suppose
then ned turned to the clergyman
if you can pray ill be glad for you to do it
dennis immediately knelt down the old man also went slowly on his knees and the weeping woman did the same
o almighty god who has been pleased to take our brother from his sufferings and liberate an immortal soul from mortal clay be thou beside him now that he may pass over the dark river with his hand in his saviours and enter as a good and faithful servant into the joy of his lord
and support the sorrows of those cared for him on earth and help them and all men to profit by the lesson of his charity and and ready ear for the trouble of his
let us walk in the way that he walked and pass in peace at the end as he has passed
and this we beg for the sake of our mediator and comforter our blessed lord and redeemer thy son jesus christ
amen said ned and thank you
he rose cast one glance at the woman by the bed then looked upon his brother and then prepared to depart
but he returned for a moment
will you do the rest
he asked of mrs cora
or shall i tell em to send
no i darent
tell him to send
i must go home she answered
a loud noise persisted in the bar but he did not enter it
he took his hat and an old umbrella from the corner of the then descended and went out into the night
chapter xiii the doctor who attended nathan ned in his last illness heard from mr_gollop mr_gollop what had been done and he took a serious view of it
from the standpoint of his opinions humphrey ned had struck a blow at society and the established order
the physician was and earnest
he communicated with the coroner of the district stated the case impartially and left the official to act as seemed proper to him
but the coroner was also a medical man and he reduced the problem to its simplest possible dimensions
death had been hastened by an uncertain measure of time for one who was enduring extreme agony
he judged the case on its own merits after a rare judicial faculty peculiar to himself
he made no effort to consider its general bearing and tendency he did not enlarge his survey to the principles involved
his sympathy was entirely on the side of humphrey ned he applauded the old man in his heart and declared no inquest necessary
none was therefore held
those interested in nathans end took opposite views and as for humphrey himself he was hidden for a time from the people and did not appear again in public until his brothers funeral
he failed therefore to learn the public opinion
jack and those who thought as he did upheld the action but not a few shared the faith of thomas openly expressed at the bar of the white thorn while still the dead master lay above
for two days nathan kept a sort of humble state and the folk from far and near enjoyed the spectacle of his corpse
many ten miles to see him
the humblest people appeared the most unexpected persons acknowledged debts of unrecorded kindness
he lay in his coffin with a face placid and small behind the bush of his silver beard
women wept at the sight and took a morbid joy in touching his folded hands
then he was hidden for ever and carried with difficulty down the narrow and winding stair of the inn
thomas dug the grave and helped him
no younger men assisted them
they felt a sort of sentiment in the matter
tis the last pit i shall open said and for my part if i had my way i shouldnt make it very deep
in these cases the law though slow is sure and it may come about that hell have to be up again inside a month to prove murder against that dark awful man to
tis the point of view
i dont look at it quite the same
for my part in my business i see a lot of men but plants
and when a bush or what not be going home i dont stand in the way
no good tinkering i often says to miss dennis for the silly woman seems to think a gardener can stand between a plant and death
the herb be going home i says and us cant stay the appointed time
but i dont want it to go mustnt go home shell answer a silly child talking
however when her back be turned i do my duty
the bonfires the place
jack looked over the wall a bit and seed me firing up and he said ah your bonfires like charity it covers a multitude of sins
a biting tongue that man hath
at the recollection but mr_gollop was not amused
a plant and a man are very different he answered
scripture tells us that the fire is the place for the withered branch but where theres a soul working out its salvation in fear and trembling who be we worms to stand up and say go
it might be the lord put it in neds heart argued joe_voysey
the lord bant in the habit of putting murder in peoples hearts i believe
you didnt ought to use the word
he might have you up if he come to hear it
i wish he would i only wish he would declared thomas
fearless youd find me with evidence behind me i can promise you
but not him he knows too well for that
they stood and rested where nathans grave began to yawn beside that of his brother
white marble shone out above vivian and not only his farewell verse but also a trophy representing the old wrestlers championship belt was carved there
twill make history in more ways than death will foretold thomas
what do you think
parsons going to help with the funeral
why not
why not
you ask that
nat was a dissenter and his dissenting minister be going to bury him but dennis says seeing how highly thought upon he was by all parties that it becomes all parties to be at his grave
and hes going to be there and if the bishop to learn of it thered be a that might shake england in my opinion
if his reverence says hell be there there hell be
i dont doubt that
my belief is that alls well at headquarters and theyre giving the man rope enough to hang with
this may be the last straw
comforted by the reflection thomas resumed his labours
hell lie cheek by jowl with his brother he said
go easy in that corner be getting to the shoulder of vivians bricks afore long
the circumstance of nathans passing had been received with very real grief by most of his relations
even distant kindred mourned and not a few of the race who were strangers to the neds of shaugh appeared at the funeral
mrs ned of cadworthy felt helpless and faced almost with a second widowhood for all her financial affairs had rested in nathans willing hand since her husband died
her daughters also mourned in very genuine fashion
their uncle had been kind helpful and generous to them
only mr bassett did not greatly suffer for now he knew that his wife must inherit her own and hoped indeed for some addition under the will of the departed innkeeper
as for rupert ned he endured very real grief but ned was too concerned with the bearing of this event on his own affairs to feel it deeply
he would now be free to administer his capital as he pleased
only his mother stood between
one black cloud however thrust itself upon his immediate future
his wedding was postponed
cora insisted upon it and her mother supported her
their motives were widely different but they arrived at the same conclusion
priscilla hid her grief from all eyes but her sons while he less skilled surprised the folk by his evident sorrow
they failed to understand it and acute people laughed judged it to be simulation and despised the man for his display
cora and phyllis neither pretended nor felt grief
the elder had talked her sister round and they arrived at a perfectly rational conclusion
it was averse from their father
it led them to regard him as a selfish and a cruel man
they considered also that he had deceived himself and wickedly wronged the unborn that he might perform a obligation to the dead
cora put the case very clearly
mother wont see it and tis vain to try to make her and heathman wont see it because hes a fool and only just misses being weak in his head
but i see it clear enough and the ugly truth of the man is that for five thousand pounds he was content to let his children come into the world bastards
thats what he did and im not going to pretend i care for him or shall ever respect his memory
itll never come out however said phyllis
im sure i hope it out of my mouth anyway
but still it is so and all the money he may have left behind him wont make me feel different
we shall be rich i hope anyway speculated phyllis
i suppose we shall and thats the only bright thing about it
twill be funny not walking first behind the coffin and not sitting in the mourners pew after for the sunday sermon and we knowing all the time thats where we ought to be said the younger but cora exploded the theory
not at all
weve no right the right of the most distant cousin twenty times removed
mother was his mistress and she darent use the word husband even to us though ive seen her mouth itching to do it
tis always your dear father
she cant put on a widows streamers though its in her heart to
shell have to balance her black pretty cautious i can tell you if she dont want the people to be staring
surely it must all come out if he leaves his money to us
hell do it clever said cora bitterly
with all his faults he was clever enough
he didnt hide clever as a lapwing hides her near thirty years to let it come out the minute he was dead
if i was engaged to be married like what you are i shouldnt be so nervous said phyllis
as to that twas as well for me that it fell out now and not later
it may mean a bigger establishment after all and even a bigger wedding if i put it off till spring
my word whatll ned say
but neds view did not enter as a serious factor into coras
hes all right she answered
if im content sos he
storm heralded the funeral day and dawn from much weeping
it was hoped that further torrents might hold off until after the ceremony and happily they did so though intermittent rain fell and the wind stormed roughly out of a south
blessed be the that the rain rains on said in muffled accents to jack
they were walking under the coffin and bore it with the assistance of six other men to the grave
bant so blessed for them thats alive however answered jack
the mourners will be lashed out of their skins by the look of it
deaths never so busy as at a funeral
a purple pall spread over the coffin and while humble men carried the weight of nathan neds dust others of greater repute stood at the corners of the
they included mr milly of timothy timothy of farm heathman cora as representing one from nathans lawyer and others
humphrey ned walked beside the coffin as chief mourner and hester ned on her son neds arm followed him with the rest of the family save nathans namesake who was at sea
other relations came after them with nicholas bassett pollys husband and milly the wife of rupert
cora and her mother and her sister were next in the long procession and half a dozen private carriages stood together beneath the churchyard wall to support a convention and indicate the respect that their owners entertained towards the dead
flowers covered the pall and stood piled beside the grave
crosses wreaths and various trophies were here together with many little humble bunches from cottage gardens and not a few mere gleanings from the hedgerow of scarlet and crimson berries or the last autumnal splendour of beech and briar
the air was heavy with emotion and many wept
a congregational minister conducted the service and the vicar helped him
after the body had sunk to earth and the rite was nearly accomplished the chief mourners took their last look upon the lid according to custom
leaves whirled in the air and the branches overhead made a mighty sigh and in the brief silence
underfoot was trampled mire and grass
a pushing child slipped in the clay at the and nearly fell in
she was dragged back by thomas and despatched weeping to the rear
humphrey ned came almost the last to look into the grave and as others had fallen away from it when he did so he assumed a momentary prominence
his small bent and sombre shape appeared alone at the edge of the earth with flowers piled about his knees
then suddenly ominously cutting its way through the full diapason of the on trees and tower there crept a different utterance
the wind shouted deep and loud but this noise was thin and harsha hissing a sharp shrill that gained volume presently and spread epidemic into the crowded ranks of the collected men
they were mostly the young who permitted themselves this attack but not a few of their elders joined with them
the sounds deepened a groan or two threaded the hisses
then ned from his abstraction awakened to the terrific fact that here beside his brothers grave in the eyes of all men a demonstration had broken out against him
hands were pointed even fists were shaken
he could not immediately understand he looked helplessly into certain angry faces and then shrank back from the grave to where his relations stood
whats the meaning of this
he asked ned but the young man turned and pretended not to hear him
then the truth came hurtling like a missile
voices shouted at him the words murderer and
the fire that lights a mob into one blaze was afoot and leaping from heart to head
many for a jest these insults at him and thought it good for once to bate so unpopular a creature
a few in honest and righteous rage cried out their wrath
of such were those who stoned the martyrs to serve their jealous gods
more stones than one now actually did fly and humphrey was struck upon the arm
a counter display of feeling ran like a wave against the enemies of the man and induced a shock in the crowd
dennis and others laboured to still the gathering storm womens voices against the noise of the men
joe_voysey with admirable presence of mind drew some boards over the dead in his grave that no quick spirit might suddenly fall upon him
the disturbance ended as swiftly as it had begun for humphrey ned made a bolt dashed through the crowd descended the churchyard steps and reached the street
a dozen hastened to follow but jack cora timothy mr dennis and ben north the policeman resisted the rioters and kept them within the churchyard walls as far as possible
jack hit so hard that soon he was involved in a battle against odds on his own account
meantime with a clod or two past his head humphrey reached the street corner and hastened round it
here was silence and peace
he stopped and his brain grew dizzy
such exertion he had not made for many years
he heard the noise of men and hastened on
a chaos of ideas choked his mind and dammed all play of coherent thought
he had heard a rumour that the thing he had done for his brother was regarded differently by different men but he knew not that so many were incensed and enraged
the shock of the discovery disarmed him now and left him frantic
he looked forward and believed that his last hope of reconciliation with humanity was dead
he envied the eternal peace of his brother as he struggled on against the hill homeward
into the black and waterlogged heart of shaugh moor he climbed presently and from exhaustion and fell there
he stopped upon the ground for a few moments then lifted himself to his hands and knees then sat down upon a stone and stared down into the theatre of this tragedy
overhead a sky as wild as his soul made huge and threatening preparations for the delayed tempest
through the tangled skirts of the darkness westerly there strove and spread great passages of dazzling silver all tattered and torn and shredded out of the black and clouds
for a moment in the midst of this radiance there opened a farewell where the azure firmament was seen only to vanish instantly
then the gloom gathered and huddled up in ridges of purple and of lead
aloft from the skirt of the main cumulus where it swept under the zenith there hung light as a veil yet darker than the sky behind them long writhing tentacles that twisted down and curled in sinister suspension that waved and twined and felt hither and thither horribly like some aerial hydra seeking prey
for a time these curtains of the rain swayed clear of earth but their progress swept them against it and they burst their vials upon the bosom of the moor
the storm exploded emptied itself with howling rage out of the sudden darkness
then the fury of these tenebrous moments passed the hurricane sped onward and the dim wet ray that followed struck down upon a heath whitened with ice for miles
a bitterness of cold and an of unfamiliar radiance were thrown upwards from the crust of the hail but soon it melted and the waste now running with a million rivulets grew dark again
the spectacle must have been impressive to any peaceful mind but ned saw nothing hyperbolic in the rage of wind and water
the storm cited by nature was not more tremendous than that tornado now sweeping through his own soul
end of second book book iii chapter i humphrey ned continued to stalk the stage of life like a lonely ghost and still obscured from all men and women the secrets of his nature and the fierce interest of his heart in matters human
the things that he most wished to display he deliberately concealed as a shy child who makes a toy and longs to show it but dares not yet grows warm to the roots of his being if the treasure is found and applauded
behind doubts suspicions and jealousies he hid himself his tongue was rough his utterances at the outrage put upon him before the people by his brothers grave were bitter and even coarse
nor did it abate his concern to know that the hostile explosion was as much simulated as genuine as much mischievous as meant
it drove him in upon himself it poisoned his opinion of human wisdom and for a time he moved through darkest night
yet this transcendent gloom preceded a dawn the crisis of his unquiet days approached and from the death of nathan onward life changed gradually for the man and opened into a way that until now had been concealed from his scrutiny
there chanced an hour when humphrey ned rode upon his pony under the high ground above
he came by appointment to meet his dead brothers lawyer and accident had postponed the interview for some weeks
the solicitor desired to see him
there were strange rumours in the air and it was declared that a very surprising and unexpected condition of things had appeared upon the publicans passing
humphrey refused to hear even his own relations upon the matter for he held nathans estate no concern of his but at the urgent entreaties of the master of now rode to see him
he had however already made it clear that he was to be considered in no way responsible for his brothers obligations and felt unprepared to offer advice or engage himself in any particular
he passed across the shoulder of pen beacon through a wild world of hills streaked with flitting radiance and clouded in moisture driven before a great wind
the sky was lowering and a gale from the atlantic swept with tremendous power along but the nature of the scene it struck was such that little evidence of the force displayed could appear to the beholder
stone and steep and sodden waste stared blindly at the pressure and not
it remained for wandering beast or man to bend before it and reveal its might
on the pelt of the sheep and cattle or against the figure of a wanderer its buffet was manifest and in the sky the fierce breath of it herded the clouds into flocks that sped and spread and gathered again too swiftly for the telling
they broke in billows of sudden light they massed into darkness and hid the earth beneath them then again they parted and like a ragged flag above a broken army the clean blue unfurled
over this majestic desolation suddenly there shot forth a great company of rooks and the wind drove them before and wheeling and tumbling in giddy dives only to mount again
a joyous spirit clearly dominated the feathered people
they circled and cried aloud in merry exultation of the air
they swooped and soared rushed this way and that on slanting pinions played together and revelled in the immense force that drove them like projectiles in a wild throng before it
even to these aerial things such speed was strange
they seemed to comment in their language upon this new experience
then the instinct that makes vast companies of living creatures wheel and warp together in mysterious and perfect unison inspired them
they turned simultaneously ascended and set their course against the wind
but they could make no headway now and in a cloud they were blown together beaten to leeward
whereupon they descended swiftly to the level of the ground and flying low together back whence they had come
at a yard or two above earths surface they steadily flapped along cheated the wind and for a few moments flashed a reflected light over the moor with their innumerable shining black bodies and pinions outspread
at a hedge they rose only to dip again and here humphrey who drew up to watch them marked how they worked in the teeth of the gale and was near enough to see their great grey bills their anxious glittering eyes and their hurtling feathers blown awry as they breasted the hedge fought over and dipped again
tis the same as life he reflected
go aloft and strive for high opinions and the wind of doubt blows you before it like a leaf
up there you can travel with the storm not against it
if you want to go way youve got to feel along close to earth earth and the manners of earth and the folk of the earth
and hard work at that but better than driving along all alone
he derived some consolation from this inchoate thought and suspected a moral but the simile broke down
his mind returned to presently and taking leave of the moor he descended and arrived at the lawyers hawk_house upon the appointed hour
the things that he heard though he was prepared for some such recital astounded him by their gravity
the fact was of a familiar character but it came with the sting of novelty to those involved
an uproar of which humphrey in his isolation had heard but the dim echo already rioted through shaugh and far beyond it
ill give you a sketch of the situation said the man of business
and i will then submit my own theory of that any theory can alter the exceedingly unpleasant facts
it belongs merely to the moral side of the situation and may help a little to condone our poor friends conduct
in a word i do not believe he was responsible
begin at the other end answered humphrey
whether he was responsible or not wont help us now
and it wont prevent honest men spurning his grave i fancy
collected his papers and read a long and dismal statement
his client had always kept his affairs closely to himself and such was the universal trust and confidence that none ever pressed him to do otherwise
he had been given a free hand in the administration of considerable sums he had invested where he pleased and for many years had enjoyed the best of good fortune despite the hazardous character of the securities he affected
no man was ever cursed with such an incurable gift of hope explained the lawyer
all along the line youll find the same sanguine and unjustifiable methods exhibited
the rate per cent was all he cared about
his custom was to pay everybody four and a half and keep the balance
but when companies came to grief nobody heard anything about it he went on paying the interest and no doubt went on hoping to make good the capital
this however he seldom appears to have done
there are about forty small people who deposited their savings with him and there is nothing for any of them but valueless paper
he was bankrupt a dozen times over and the thing hed evidently pinned his last hope toa big south american silver going the way of the others
had it come off the position might have been retrieved but it is not coming off
he put five thousand pounds into his own hoped i suppose to make thirty thousand
it was his last flutter
where did he get the money
by mortgaging cadworthy and by using a good deal of his late brothers capital
i mean the estate of vivian ned
hes a fraudulent trustee then
he is
he had already mortgaged all his own property
he was in a very tight place about the time of vivians death and the money he had to handle then carried him on
what did he do with his own money
how did he spend that
we shall never know unless somebody comes forward and tells us
i trace the usual expenditures of a publican and other expenses
he always kept a good horse or two and he rode to hounds until latterly and subscribed to several hunts
he was foolishly generous at all times
i see that he gave away large sums unfortunately they were not his own
there is no doubt that his judgment failed completely of late years
he was so accustomed to success that he had no experience of failure and when inevitable failures came they found him quite unprepared with any reserves against them
to stem the tide he gambled and when his speculations miscarried he waded still more deeply
he was engaged in borrowing a large sum of money just before his final illness
indeed he came to me for it for he kept me quite in the dark concerning existing mortgages on his property
but he forgot i should want the
he was a devious man but i shall always believe that he lacked moral understanding to know the terrible gravity of the things he did
how do we stand now
the estate is from six thousand to seven thousand pounds to the bad
what is there against that
the assets are practically nil
about forty pounds at the bank and the furniture at the white thorn inn
of course his largest creditor will be ned of cadworthy
i want to say by the way that this state of things is quite as much of a surprise to me as to anybody
it is true that i have been his solicitor for twenty years but my work was nominal
i had no knowledge whatever of his affairs
he never consulted me when in difficulties or invited my opinion on any subject
what about the coras
they have asked to stop at for the present
i fancy mrs cora was a close friend of your brothers
however she is not communicative
the mortgagee in that case of course and will i think be contented to let mrs cora stop where she is
there was no will
i can find none
yet i know very well he made one ten years ago
at least he came to me once rather full of it
it is very likely that he destroyed it
there was a silence then humphrey ned asked a question
well what want of me
the other shrugged his shoulders
i leave that to you
you know how much or how little you regard this disaster as a personal one
it has nothing whatever to do with me
i never lent him a penny
he never asked me to do so
you dont recognise any obligation
absolutely not a shadow of any such thing
the family of which you are now head
a sentimental lawyer
the other laughed
not much room for least plenty of room no doubt
of course if you dont consider he broke off but his listener did not speak
it is to be understood i must not ask you to help me
not in any practical with not
for the rest if as a man of business i can be of any service for the sake of the family
the family is nothing to meat least the one hit hardest is nothing to me
hell have to work for his living now
thats no hardship
it may be the best thing thats befallen him yet
very true indeed
well let us leave the main question open
the case has no very unusual features
occasionally the world trusts a man to his grave and then finds out too late that it was mistaken
it is extraordinary what a lot of people will trust a good heart ned
trust like hope springs eternal in the human breast
does it
ive never found much come my way
and im not strong in trust myself
i felt friendly to nathan because he was my own flesh and blood but trust himno
he didnt confide in you
never
ned rose
i shall see my relations no doubt pretty soon
i fancy theyll pay me some visits
well why not
im lonely and rolling in they think
a woman that i rather expect to call upon me
in fact ive her to do so
perhaps if she dont ill call on her
for the present we can leave it
if theres no money nobody can hope to be paid
well talk more on that later
whos got cadworthy
westcott of cann quarries
he lent the money on it
what the devil does he want with it
asked ned
that i cant tell you
probably he doesnt want it
hes foreclosed of course
it was only out of friendship and regard for nathan that he lent so much money on the place
he tells me that your brother explained to him that it was for a year or so to help ned and out of respect for the family he gladly obliged
didnt know westcott was so rich
you never know whos got the money in these parts
but tis safe to bet that it isnt the man who spends most
theres mr timothy timothy too he lent nathan a thousand six months ago
some story your poor brother told him and of course for such a man he gladly obliged
each that he raised money from thought he was the only one asked of course
he was a rogue and the worst sort of preaching rogue
such men are the thieves of virtue
tis an infamous story
the lawyer stared and humphrey continued
such men are robbers i tell of more than money and widows
they are always seeming honest and never being so
they run with the hare and hunt with the hounds
they get the benefit of being rogues and the credit of honest men
they are imitation good men and at heart know not the meaning of real goodness
they have the name of being generous and are neither
look what this man has left behind turned to curses
all a sham and a lifelong theft of mens admiration and theft for he won it by false pretences and lived a lie
he is dead however
yes he is dead and i suppose you are the sort who like to with facts and never speak ill of the dead
why should we not tell the truth about those who are gone
does it hurt them to say it
no but it may do the living some good to say it
if living knaves see us condoning and forgiving dead ones will they turn from their any the quicker
were a sentimental generation
justice is the last thing thought of
its so easy to be merciful to people who have sinned against somebody else
but mercys slow poison if you ask me
it rots the very roots of justice
the other shrugged his shoulders
the first of christian virtues ned we must remember that
but argument wont alter facts
you dont see your way to do anything definite so theres an end of it
of course there is no shadow of obligation
youre right
ill visit you again presently
meantime you might let me have a copy of the claims
im interested in knowing how many fools trusted my dead brother with their money
i should like to know what manner of man and woman put their savings into another mans pocket without security
it seems contrary to human nature
theres no objection at all
they are all clamouring for their money
and if the south american silver mine had done all that was hoped not only would they have had their cash but your brother must have saved his own situation cleared his responsibilities and died solvent
if
theres generally a rather big if with a south american anything i believe
they parted and humphrey ned rode home again
upon the way he deeply pondered all the things that he had heard and not until he was back at did distraction from these thoughts come
then he found that a woman to see him
it was priscilla cora who had called at his invitation and now he remembered that he had asked her and half regretted the act
chapter ii mrs cora arrived by appointment for while one instinct of his nature pressed humphrey to evade this problem and take no hand in the solution another and more instant impulse acted in opposition
he surveyed the sweep of events as they struck at those involved in nathans ruin and death and acting upon reasons now to be divulged he sent first for the mistress of because in his judgment her right to consideration was paramount
even in the act of summoning her he told himself that these claims were no business of his to investigate and that he was a fool to meddle
he repudiated responsibility at one breath and deliberately assumed it with the next
his own motives he did not pause to examine
introspection irritated him and he turned from his conflicting ideas with impatience
in himself he only saw a very imprudent and impertinent person yet he proceeded
now came mrs cora to know what he would have and he saw her with an emotion of hearty regret that he had invited her
in answer to his first question she assured him that she and her children were well
im afraid putting off the wedding has annoyed your nephew a good bit she said but cora felt that it was better and so did i
why did you think so
well your brother held it so much to heart and he was neds uncle
we could only have made a very quiet business of it in decency and cora felt be sad to marry under the cloud of death
half the sorrow in the world is wasted on what cant be helped
its folly to mourn whats beyond as great folly as to mourn the past
surely you know that
no doubt but who can help it thats made on a human pattern
the world would be a cheerful place if none wept for what cant be altered
there was nothing in reason to stand between us and the wedding
twas my brothers last wish for that matter
she did not answer and a silence fell between them
he was determined that she should break it and at length she did so
your brother was very fond of cora
of course we at miss him a very great deal
you
at present the idea is that they get married in spring and that wont be none too soon for everythings altered now
theyll have to sell half they bought and get rid of their fine hawk_house and their horses and much else
this business has entirely altered the future for them poor things
utterly of course
twill have to be real love to stand this pinch
better they wait a bit and see how they feel about it
they may change their minds
both are pretty good at that
she sighed
they understand each other i believe
but ned wont change whatever cora does
hes wrapped up heart and soul in her
hell have to seek work now
yes he is doing so
the one thing hes never looked for
harder to find work than foxes
hes not good for much
you say that of your future
truths truth
a harmless and useless man
i cant for the life of me think what hell find to do
nathan would have given him a
how wonderful he was at finding work for people
and what does cora think of it all
shes a very secret girl
and heathman
heathman be going to make my home for
decided where we go
you leave then
yes
nathan wouldnt have wished that im sure
we were to have stopped but the new owner wants to raise the rent to nearly as much again
what used you to pay
she hesitated
like many people whose position has forced them into the telling of countless lies she was still tender of truth in trifles
no matter he said
i can guess the figure very easily and noughts the shape of it
a sinister foreboding flashed through her mind
it seemed impossible to suppose such an innuendo innocent
mr_gollop had said many offensive things concerning her after nathans death but few had believed them and still fewer shown the least interest in the subject
it was absurd to suppose that humphrey ned would trouble his head with such a rumour
your brother was generous to all she answered
why he was
and if charity shouldnt begin at home where should it
he was very generous to all she repeated
ive been seeing today
hes a true kind man and wishful to do what he can
the rent asked now for is too high even in the good state weve made it
so ive got to leave
twill be a wrench
yes indeed
but not such a bad one as his death
thats true
he probed her
never to see him come down your path with his bustling gait never to hear the laughter of the man
you held his hand when he went out of life
he loved the master passion of him
a flush of colour leapt and spread over her face
she gasped but said nothing
a cruel thing that he left you as he did
what was i
she began alert and ready to fight at once and crush this suspicion
what are you saying
we were nothing he held up his hand
a fools lifelong fools trick to hide ita cruel witless wrong against generations belief in a sane man
i dont understand you
gods my
im not an enemy
you neednt put out your claws you neednt lie to me
you neednt break oaths to me
its a secret still but i know me
you were his mistress priscilla mistress and the mother of his children
he never told you that
not he
who did tell you
cora told me
shed rather have she told in words but every other way
i knew it the hour she came to see me after she was engaged to marry my son
she strokes her chin like nat stroked his beard
have you marked that
she thinks just like nat thought in a lot of ways though shes not got his heart
shes not near so silly as he was
her voice was the echo to his as soon as i got the clue
her eyes were his again
she handles her knife and fork just like he was wont to do it she sets her head o one side to listen to anybody in the way he did
theres birds do it they gather worms out of the grass
and from that i took to marking
your second girl be more like you but heathman will be nearer his father every day as he gets older
if he a beard hed be nearer him now
wait and watch
and hes got his heart
dont speak till you hear more
from finding out that much i sounded nathan himself
little he guessed it but what i didnt know i soon learned from him
cora was the apple of his eye
she could do no wrong
twas vivian and ned over again
he spoke of you very guarded but i knew what was behind
it came out when he was dying and he was too far gone to hide it
and let me say this ill never forgive him for doing such a wicked
god may but i wont
i wouldnt forgive myself if i forgave him
but man as i am i can see a bit of what your life was
a better more precious life than mine no woman ever lived
he took a deep breath
here she tacitly confessed to all that he had declared
she did not even confirm it in words but granted it and proceeded with the argument
and yet his whole theory had been built upon presumption
if she had denied the truth he possessed no shadow of power to prove it
if ever i pitied anybody i pity you and i admire you in a sort of way
youre a very uncommon creature to have hid it in the face of such a village as shaugh
what i am he made me
he was a man in ten thousand
i hope he was
leave him
let me say this afore we get on
i dont judge you and god knows it im alive to this thing from your point of view
you loved him well enough even for that
but theres no will
he had nothing to leave youve saved money during his lifetime
i dont want you to have anything to do with my affairs mr
ned
as you please
but there are your children to be considered
now it may very much surprise you to know that i have thought a lot about them
should you say speaking as an outsider that im under any obligation to serve them
the sudden and most unexpected question again startled the blood from mrs coras heart
what a terrible curious man you are
what a question to ask me
she said
answer it if you wasnt interested in it
no she declared presently
none can say that they are anything to do with you
you wasnt your brothers keeper
they be no kin of yours in law or justice
in
in justice they are of my blood
not that thats anything
youre right
they are nought to me
and you are less than nought
but he stopped
why have you told me that you have found this out
she asked
what good can come of it
youll admit at least tis a sacred secret and youve no right whatever to breathe it to a living soul
you wont deny that
there such a lot of sides to it
you might argue for and against
justice is terrible difficult
suppose for instance that i held like jack holds and many such that tis a very improper thing and a treachery to the unborn to let first cousins i held to that
ought i to sit by and let cora marry ned
now theres a nice question for an honest man
you were going to let cora marry your own son
i dont know so much about that
they were engaged to each other before i found it out and then as she soon flung him over there was no need for me to speak
now the question is shall i let these two of the same blood breed and maybe bring things than themselves into the world
this is all too deep for me
one thing i know and that is you can say nought
youve come to the truth by the terrible wonderful brains in your head but youve no right to make it known
youre ashamed of it
she looked at him almost with contempt
you can ask that and know me even so little as you do
gods my judge that id shout it out from the top of the church tower tomorrow id be proud for the world to know and so much the louder id sing it because hes gone down to his grave unloved and in darkness
it would make life worth living to me even now if i could open my mouth and fight for him against the world
not a good word do i hear curse forget the other side of forget how his heart went out to the sorrowful and sad
but the use of talking
he dont want me to fight for him
if you feel that why dont you stand up before the people and tell em
theres my children
be they more to you than he was
no but they are next
i hate deceit
wholl think the worse of them
who wont
none that are worth considering
you know very little about the world for all that you are deep as the dark and can find out things hidden
what about my darters
no it wouldnt be a fair thing to let it out
i hold it very important
it shant be i tell you
you cant do it you never would
youre right
i never would
but thats not to say i dont wish it to come out
for them mind you i speak
i leave you out now
i put you first and you say youd like it known
so i go on to them and i tell you that for their peace of mind and wellbeing in the future tis better a thousand times they should start open and fair without the need of this lie between them and the world
i dont agree with that
when the truth was told them on his deathbed twas settled it should never go no further
wait and think a moment before you decide
what has it been to you to hide the truth all your life
a necessity
i soon grew used to it
nobody was hurt by it
and nathan kept his money
dont fool yourself to think that none was hurt by it
everybody was hurt by it
a prosperous lie be like a prosperous thistle it never yet flourished without ripening seed and increasing its own poisonous stock a
the worlds full of that thistledown
your children know the truth themselves therefore i say it should come out
theyve no right to stand between you and the thing you want to do
ill wager heathman dont only your daughters
more than that
nathan would never have wished it known
no argument at all
he was soaked in and couldnt see straight for years afore he died
i wont have it and i wont argue about it
well your words law
but youre wrong and youll live to know youre wrong
now what are you going to do
well start as though i knew nought of this for the moment
i stop at till spring
ive got no money to name
we shall settle between and heathman
ill he stopped
no he said i cant promise anything come to think of it and i cant commit myself
tis folly to say let the position be as though i didnt know the truth
it cant be
i do know it and im influenced by it
ill do nothing at all for any of you unless this comes out
i say that not because i dont care for my brothers children but because i do care for them
i dont want you to do anything
ive got my son
i refuse absolutely to speak
until my children are all of one mind about it the thing must be hidden hidden up for evermore
i wont argue the right or the wrong
tis out of my hands and so long as one of them says no i hold it my duty to keep silent
and of course tis yours also
who knows what my duty would be if ned was going to marry cora
id sacrifice the unborn to you but not to your daughter and my nephew
there have been enough tongues to curse that worthless pair already
you dont want their own children to do the same in the time to come
but perhaps i know as much about cora as you do about ned
wait and see if she changes her mind since he has lost his fortune
priscilla rose
i will go now she said
of course you cant guess how this looks to a to me of all women
to find that you no doubt you thought id come here and drop dead afore you of shame
no i didnt
if youd been that sort i shouldnt have it out so straight
you are a brave creature and must always have been so
well i wont deny you the name of wife in you like to claim it
she was moved and thanked him
satisfaction rather than concern dominated her mind as she returned homeward
she felt glad that nathans brother knew and no shadow of fear dimmed her satisfaction for she was positive that despite any declared doubts he would never make the truth public
her own attitude was even as she had described it
she would have to declare her close companionship if only to stop the tongues of those who hesitated not to vilify the dead before her
mr_gollop mr_gollop had told many stories concerning mrs coras attendance in the sick room but few were interested in them or smelt a scandal
they never identified priscilla with the vanished innkeeper they did not scruple to censure nathan before her and heap on his fallen head
often with heart and soul she longed to fight for him often she had some ado to hide her impotent anger but a lifetime of dissimulation had skilled her in the art of
she listened and looked upon the angry man or woman she even acquiesced in the abuse by silence
seldom did she defend the dead man excepting in secret against her daughters
chapter iii when cora returned home she brought with her a resolution
her intentions were calculated to cause pain and she carried them so much the quicker to execution that the thing might be done and the blow struck as swiftly as possible
she revealed her plan to none and only made it public when he who was chiefly involved had learned it
ned called to see cora who had been stopping with friends and when she had spoken upon general subjects she made him come out with her to the wintry side of west down and there imparted her wintry news
have you found anything to do
was coras first question and he answered that he had not
people dont understand me he said
here is rupert talking about labourers work as if it was a perfectly decent suggestion to make
my farms gone and he seems to think i might offer to stop there under somebody like he has himself
you want something better
why of course
i might get a clerkship or some such thing i should think
a man who has lived my life cant go and dig potatoes
but the difficulty is to get work like that away from towns
i cant be expected to live in a town and i wont
mr tim timothy is a friend of the people ive been stopping with she said
hes rich and all that
i believe he might find thank you for nothing cora
im hardly likely to trouble him am i
not much use talking like that
ill take patronage if i must because beggars cant be but ill not take it from my inferiors
inferiors
thats a funny word for you to use
how is timothy timothy your inferior
i dont see it
dont you
he answered getting red
then you ought to see it
damn it all cora youre so where im concerned
and yet youre supposed to love me and want to marry me
im not a fool and if tis to have a bit of commonsense then im
though im a bit tired of hearing you fling the word in my face
timothy timothy always was as good a man as you and why not
i should call him a mean sort of chap too
hes not a sportsman anyway
you cant deny that
not much good being generous if youve got nought to be generous with
and mean he is not
he lent money to your uncle and never pushed the claim half as hard as many smaller men
i know him a long sight better than you do
and if youve got any sense left youll go to him and ask him if he can help you to find a job
im only thinking of myself
i can go into a hat shop any day but cant do anything
what are you good for
for that matter you dont seem to be able to get a chance to show what you are good for
all your swell hunting friends are worth just what i said they were worth
now youre down on your luck they look way
he began to grow angry
youre the fairweather sort too then
one here and there has hinted to me that you brother always said it
but never never would i stand it from any of them
and now i see that it is so
no need to call names
the case is altered since nathan ned ruined you and im not the sentimental kind to pretend different
as were on this now wed better go through with it
you want to marry me and i wanted to marry you but we cant live on air i believe
i cant anyway
its a very simple question
you wish to marry me so soon as i please but what do you mean to keep me on
ive got know that and youve got less than nothing for theres the rent of the hawk_house we were to have lived in
ive let the hawk_house and i am looking round
im open to any reasonable offer
what nonsense you talk
who are you that people should make you offers
what can you do
i ask you that again
by god
and youre supposed to love me
when poverty comes in at the know the rest
im not a heroine of a storybook
all very well for you but what about me
you cant afford to marry and i cant afford not to so there it stands
theres only one thing in the one you can be trusted to earn money at and thats teaching people to ride horses
and that you wont do
ive thought it out and you neednt swear and curse because its the truth
damn it all no good raging
youre selfish and you never think of me working my fingers to the bone and very likely not knowing where to look for a meal
you only want my happiness and prosperity
thats not love
if you loved me you would have come long since and released me from this engagement and saved me the pain of all this talk
nobody ever thinks of me and my future and my anxieties
ive only got my face say damn and ill say it too
thrice for your once and i hate you thrice as much as you hate me and ive thrice the reason to
i hate you for being so selfish and tis no good ever you saying you care about me again because you never really
you you wouldnt have put yourself first always
he started quite reduced to silence by this
she struck him dumb but his look infuriated her
you wont make me draw back so you neednt think it she cried
im not ashamed of a word ive said
tis you ought to be ashamed
and im not sorry for you neither for youve never once been sorry for me
after the crash not one word of trouble for my loss and my disappointment did you only whining about your horses and the hawk_house at plympton and all the rest of it
vain cursing of the man in his grave when you ought to have cursed yourself for letting him have the power to do what he did
id have stuck to you money or no money if youd been a different mani swear that
id have taken you and set to i shall now how can any decent girl with a proper conceit of herself sink herself to your level and become your drudge
am i to work for us both
are you going to live on the money i make out of womens bonnets
no
he answered
dont think that
im dull i know and
such a fool was i that i never believed anything bad of a woman or ever thought an unkind thought of anything in petticoats
but you use very straight english always and you make your meaning perfectly clear
i know it wont be easy for me to get the work i want
i may be poor for a long always
ill release you cora if thats what you wish
no doubt i ought to have thought of it but ill swear i never did
i thought you loved me and everything else was small by comparison
if anybody had said release her id have told him that he didnt know what love of woman a womans love of man
but you can be free and welcome and put the fault on my shoulders
they can bear it
go to timothy
hes always wanted you
you neednt be coarse
im sick and tired of all you men
you dont know what love of you
and since you say im to go ill go
and ill find peace somewhere somehow but not with none of you
he laughed savagely
youve ruined what youve done
meat and drink to you ill wager
ruined me worse than ever my uncle did
i could have stood up against that
i did
id pretty well got over the pinch of it
though twas far more to me than anybody i took it better than anybody and my own mother will tell you so
but why
because i thought id got you safe enough and nothing else mattered
i never thought this misfortune meant that youd give me the slip
if any man had hinted such a thing id have knocked his teeth down his throat
but i was wrong as usual
you gave me credit for being a fool as usual
never that cora
i always knew very well you were clever but i thought you were something more
you crafty of you
and
twill be said ive jilted another that the only woman i ever honestly worshipped with all my heart have jilted me
no need to use ugly silly words about it
all that will be said by sensible people is that weve both seen reason and cut our coats according to our cloth
the people will only say youve got more wits than they thought
let it be understood we were of the same mind and so we both get a bit of credit for sense
never
he burst out passionately
youre a cruel devil
you know where the fault is and whos to blame
you think of nought but your own blasted comfort and pleasure and you never cared no more for me than you cared for my cousin before me
but ill not hang sure of that
she shrugged her shoulders
you might do worse all the same she said
for youre only the earth that i can see
thereupon he swore wild oaths and rushed off and left her on the hillside alone
when he was gone she went her own way but not to
by deep lanes and familiar to her she took a long walk and at the end of it found herself at farm the abode of mr timothy timothy
he was from home and she asked for pen and paper that she might leave a note for him
her communication was short and when she had written it and sealed it with exceeding care she set off again for home
anon mr timothy opened it and was much disappointed at the length
but coras matter atoned for this shortcoming
have settled with nb
yours c and elsewhere while she retraced her way from the discarded lover came to a wild conclusion with himself
he steadied his steps stood at the moor edge in two minds then turned and set off for
this blow had staggered him had even awakened him from the fatuous dream in which he passed his days
he had a vague idea that humphrey might be glad to know of this broken engagement that it might even put his uncle into a more amiable temper
ned had been advised by rupert to see ned but had declined to do so until the present time
at mrs susan met him and made no effort to hide astonishment
wonders never cease im sure
you of all men
master be on the moor riding but if you want him you can wait for him
he always comes in at dusk
hows your young woman
the man was in no mood for talk with susan and cut her short
ill wait then he said
ill wait in the garden
he walked up and down amid the nut trees for an hour
then humphrey returned
tea was served for them in the kitchen susan went out and the way opened for ned
you might be surprised to see me he began but though i know you dont like enough im your eldest nephew and i felt at a time like this youd not refuse to let me speak to you
speak and welcome
of course all our lives are turned upside down by this terrible business
not all
in these cases tis the drones not the workers that are hit hardest
if youve got wit enough to understand what you see under your eyes youll find that your brother rupert for instance can go on with his life much as before and scores of lost a bit of out of it by my brother the late nathan it dont wreck them
tis only such as all your life to idle and grow fat on other mens only such as you that are stranded by a thing like this
i suppose you want to get back into the drones when the pinch of winter the world wont let you in
this uncompromising speech shook ned and under the circumstances he felt that it was more than he could bear
if you knew what had happened to me today youd not speak so harsh uncle humphrey he answered
i may tell you that ive been struck a very cruel blow in the quarter i least expected it
coras thrown me over
little bitch he said
and you about a cruel blow
why you young fool escape from her is the best piece of fortune that ever fell to your lotor is ever likely to
and you ask me to be sorry for you
fools luck is always the best luck
youve had better fortune far than ever you deserved if shes you
you cant look at it as i do you cant see what my life must be without her
eat your meat and dont babble that stuff
ned shook his head
dont want nothing thank you
well hear me said humphrey
you sought me of your own free will and so you may as well listen
youve come because you think i can do you a
im down on my luck and i thought perhaps that if you can help or if you cant you might advise me
ive looked very hard and very far for a bit of work such as i could do and ive not found it
the work you can do wont be easily found
begin at the beginning
youre have been
let god alone and hell let you my experience said ned
is it
well your experience dont reach far
youve come to the place where gods waiting for you and none too pleased at what you bring afore him
youre a fool and though we mourn for a wise man after hes dead we mourn for a fool all the days of his life
know where that comes from
of course you dont
i can mend i suppose
anyway ive got to be myself
nobody can be different to their own character
cant rise above your own character but you can easily sink below it
thats what you have done and your father helped you from the first
i wont hear you say nothing against him uncle humphrey
good or bad he was all goodness to me
you think so but youre wrong
well ill leave him
but tis vain to judge you too hard when i remember your upbringing
all the same i will say this for myself when you pull me to pieces youll find no wickedness in me worth mentioning
whatever i may be ive always behaved like a gentleman and a sportsman and none will deny it declared ned
the biggest fool can be witty when it comes to excusing his own vices to his conscience replied the old man
fox yourself with that rubbish if you can not me
to behave like a gentleman is to be a gentleman i should think and i understand the word very different from you
youre a selfish worthless man thats reached near to thirty without putting away his childish man thats grown to mans estate and stature without doing so much good in the world as my blind nor so much good as the worm that pulls the autumn leaves into the wet ground
and you pride yourself on being a gentleman
better to be a man first and a gentleman afterwards
ive never had no occasion to work till now
nobody ever asked me to nobody ever wanted me to
it was natural that i shouldnt
a man cant help his character and i cant help mine
i hate work and always shall
thats clear then
and i cant help my character either
i hate idleness and always shall
never have i given a loafer a helping hand and never will i
a man ought to be like providence and only help those who help themselves
but i mean to work i need to work i must work
laziness is a cancer said ned
tis just as much a cancer as the human ill we call by that name
and tis a modern thing
theres something rotten with the world where any man can live without earning the right to
when next you find yourself about on the moor wasting your time take a look at the circles of stones cast about on the hillsides and by the streams
my son mark knew all about them
they were set up by men like ourselves who lived on the moor very long ago
life was real then
nought but their own sweat stood between the old men and destruction
the first business of life was to keep life in them days
they hunted to live not for pleasure
they hunted and were hunted
no time to be lazy then
did they help beggars
did they keep paupers
no all had to toil for the common good and if a man didnt labour he didnt eat
they had their work cut out for em to wring a bare living out of the earth and the creatures on it
no softness of mind or body then
no holidays and and revels then
and id have it so again tomorrow if i could
work and eat idle and what id say to my
i mean to work im ready for work
all very well to say that now
you may be ready for work but what sort of work is ready for you
what can you do
can you break stones
theres a cornish proverb hits you this minute them as cant scheme must
your father was very fond of using every lazy body but you
it means that if you havent the wits to make a living with your brains you must do it with your hands
it all comes back to work
i know it does
i keep on telling you im ready for amount of it
but not breaking stones
ive got brains in my head though i know you dont think so
i came today to know if you would give those brains a trial
im a free man now
cora has flung me over so theres no obligation anywhere
im free to stand up and show what im good for
ive sold my horses and given up hunting already
thats something
something you couldnt help
how much did you get for that big bright bay
guineas
and gave
seventy
but of course ive not got enough capital all told to be much practical use in buying into anything
what i really want is five hundred pounds
a common want
and i thought perhaps that thought of it as i came here to see you
and still you try to make out youre not a fool
i can give interest and security
your nathan perhaps
in a word ill not do anything
not a farthing of money and not a hand of help
but he stopped as the younger man rose
i didnt ask for money i only suggested a loan
ill loan no loans to you or any man
but this i will do because you are the head of our family now and i dont want anybody to say i helped to cast you lower when you were down
this i will do ill double the money you earn
double it
exclaimed ned
thats my word and now the boots on the other leg and im the fool for my pains no doubt
but understand me
tis what you earn not what you get
when you come to me and say ive found a job and im paid so much a week for doing it by an independent man then ill double what he gives you
but let there be no dealings for ill very soon find them out if you try it
let it be figures let it be horses let it be clay let it be stones by the double what you earn for five years
by that time maybe youll know what work means and thank heaven thats taught you what it means
go and find what youve got to do go and find what youre worth in the open market of men
and you neednt thank me for what i offer
twill be little enough i promise youll find when you come to hear the money value of your earning powers
all the same i do thank you and i thank you with all my heart said ned and perhaps youll be a bit more astonished than you think for uncle humphrey when you find what i can do
then his nephew went away in doubt whether to be elated or cast down
chapter iv an elderly man called abraham elford became tenant of the white thorn after neds death
he lacked the charm of nathan and it was rumoured that the quality of his liquor by no means equalled that provided by the vanished master of the inn but no choice offered of other drinking and the new publican retained all former patronage
one subject at this season proved rich enough to shut out all lesser matters from conversation for the wide waves of concern set rolling when nathan died had as yet by no means subsided
each day for many days brought news of some fresh disaster to humble folk and then came another sort of intelligence that gratified the few and angered the many
mr elford and certain of his customers not directly interested found the subject of nathans affairs exceedingly wearisome and often sought to turn talk into other channels but not for long could they be said to succeed
local politics and weather soon lost their power to hold the people and those disasters spread by the late publican swiftly cropped up again to the exclusion of less pungent concerns
a party of men was assembled at the white thorn near christmas time and they on over this ground until who had not suffered turned to the host behind the bar and asked a question
did this here fire fail afore you abraham
he asked
tis a fact that the white thorn hearth havent been cold for a hundred always smouldering or else blazing upon it
yes and a thousand pities answered the other
at the time of neds death of course there was a terrible deal of running about and confusion
and the fire was forgot
i the old saying and was very sorry to see it black out
what do it matter
asked jack
he was in a quarrelsome mood and bad company on the occasion
these silly sayings and fancies are better forgot
whos the wiser for a thing like that
probably when alls said tis a lie
i dare say the fire went out scores of times when nathan was here and somebody just lit it again and said nought about it
thats wrong jack declared heathman cora who was present
ned took a lot of care of the fire and felt very proud of it
a score of times ive heard him tell people about it and that the fire had never been for more than a hundred years
one thing i know that if there was such a place as hell hed soon meet with a fire as would last longer still answered head
a fire that never will be
and right well hed deserve it
thomas found himself in agreement with this ferocity
youre right there and there is such a no fear of that though tis your way to scorn it
for my part i say that there couldnt be no justice without it
he devoured widows and stole the bread of the worse can any man do
a man can the dead and spit out his poison against them as never hurt him in word or deed answered heathman cora
tis always your way to blackguard them that be out of earshot and the power to answer and the further a man be away the louder you yelp
faults or no faults the likes of you wasnt worthy to wipe his shoes
you ill say nought began jack but the subject was too attractive for him and he proceeded
if he left your mother any money its against the law and you can tell her so
it wasnt his to leave and if she got money from him in secret its my and many other peoples before its hers
and if she was honest shed give it back
youve lost your wits over this answered cora and if you wasnt an old man jack id hammer your face for mentioning my mothers name in such a way
she never had a penny by him and the next man that says she did shall get a flea in his or young
let it be a lesson to all sorts and conditions not to trust a dissenter said mr_gollop
ive known pretty well what theyre good for from the first moment they began to lift their heads in the land
they never were to be trusted and never will be
and as for nathan ned he was a double serpent and i shall tell the truth out against him when and where i please and why for not
you dont know the meaning of truth began heathman no more dont that old cat your sister
better leave my sister alone or twill be the worse for you answered the parish clerk
ill leave her alone when she leaves my mother alone and not sooner
she a lying old to be trusted in a respectable if i was better to do id have the law of her for the things shes said
you talk of the law answered jack
you might just so well talk of the prophets
ones as rotten as nowadays
the laws gone that weak that a mans savings can be taken out of his pocket by the first thief that comes along with an honest face and him powerless
what he had of mine and the law looks on and does nought
because theres nought for it to do suggested mr elford
the law cant make bricks without straw just what it can its writing its own bills o costs answered jack
damn clever at that but let a rogue rob me of my savings and the law dont care a brass farthing
why
because im poor
is there to be nought declared in the pound
inquired an old man beside the fire
he had eight ten of mine and i was hopeful us might get back a little if twas only shillings
youll see nothing of it gaffer declared head
there wasnt much more than enough to pay for the mans coffin
and the tears shed at his grave
i laugh when i think of all them gulls and the parsons with their long faces thinking they was burying a good man and a burning light
a burning light now if he wasnt afore said mr_gollop returning to his favourite theme
youre a mean cur at heart jack burst out the dead mans son to mr_head
with all your noise about justice and liberty and right and wrong none on gods earth can show his teeth quicker and snarl worse if his own bone be took away
you nathan one him better than you
and well you know that with all his faults and foolish generous way of playing with his money and other you know there was a big spirit in the man
he meant terrible kindly always
he didnt feather his own nest
for a hundred that curse him now theres thousands that have blessed him in past years
but tis the curses come home to roost and foul a mans grave the blessings be forgot
the young mans eyes shone and his eloquence silenced the bar for a moment
jack stared
tis mark ned speaking he said
even so he was used to talk
but i didnt know you was the soft sort too heathman
what was nat to you or you to nat that you can stand up for him and talk this nonsense in the face of facts
wheres my money
when you tell me that ill tell you who knows whether forgot after all jack
interrupted
everybody bant ruined
theres a few here and the awful poor have had their money made good
i know all about that answered head tis that fool the parson
dennis have no more idea of justice than any other church minister and hes just picked and chosen according to his own fancy and made it up to this man and that man out of his own riches
to no man has he made it up corrected mr_gollop
tis only in the case of certain needy females that come forward
a widow here and there have been paid back in full
i made so bold as to ask lawyer mr_popham about it but hes not a very civil man and he me off with a lawyers answer that meant nought
tis well to be dennis however said joe_voysey
yes well to us but not to the general public
some think its the lawyer himself but thats a wild saying
last thing hed do
hell be out of pocket as it is
at this juncture was presented the unusual spectacle of a woman in the bar of the white thorn and susan entered
she was known to several present and men liked her
she understood the sex and could give as good as she got
she expected little in the way of civility or sense from them and she was seldom disappointed

cried head
be you on the downward path then susan
tis your old man driving you to drink without a doubt
the abundant woman pushed jack out of her way and came to the counter
dont you pay no heed to that there she said
and him old enough and ugly enough to know better youd think
a drop of gin hot please
i be and ive got to speed home yet
hows the hawk
asked mr joe_voysey
we all thought when poor old nathan was took off that hed come forward with his money the man didnt we souls
this excellent jest awakened laughter till susan stopped it
she took her drink to the fire loosed a little fur tippet from her great shoulders and warmed her feet alternately
a funny old fool you are funny enough to make other fools laugh
and why should humphrey ned waste his money on a lot of silly people
which of you would come forward and help him if he was hard up
i would said jack
with my opinions id help any thrifty person let in by this dead i could
but i was let in myself
and youre in the truth to call us fools for so we were
its reason every way that your master might think of his brothers good name and right the wrong done by the man who was here afore me declared mr elford impartially
why
asked mrs susan
why do you say tis reason
if tis reason for him tis just as much reason for every other man who can afford to mend it
thats what i say argued jack but none agreed with him
bant our business but tis humphrey neds declared the publican
the dead man was his own brother and his only one
for the credit of the family he ought to come forward and not leave the parson and other outsiders to do it
because your brother does wrong tis no business of yours to right the wrong answered mrs susan
besides tis well known that charity begins at home
and stops there suggested mr_gollop
no doubt at you and him be as snug as beetles in the tree bark while other people dont know where to turn for a roof to cover em
theyd have poor speed if they was to turn to you anyway she said
tis like your silly impudence to speak like that of a better man than ever you was or will be or know how to be
he bant bound to tell you where he spends his money i believe and if you was half as good a there what can you expect from a mr_gollop but a grunt
a poor generation you and your knows which is the worse
bravo susan
have another drop along o me cried heathman cora and she agreed to do so
what do you know and what dont you know
asked head presently
be your old party going to do anything or nothing
i dont know
but this i do know that all your wild tales down here about his money be silly lies
we live hard enough i can promise that whatever you may think
if every man here spent his money so wise as humphrey ned you wouldnt all be in this bar now but along with your lawful wives and families helping the poor women to find a bit of pleasure in life
but i know you you get a shipload of brats and leave their mothers to do all the horrid work of em while you come in here every night like lords and soak and twaddle and waste your money and put the world right then go home not fit company for a dog steady onno preaching of the bar said mr joe_voysey
you think were all blanks because you drew a blank susan
yes a blank you drew though you might have had me in the early forties
you
id make a better man than you with a dozen retorted susan
and i didnt draw a blank i susan whod be here now teaching you chaps to drink if the lord had spared him
you cant even drink feeble have you
susan with all his faults was a fine man and sos humphrey ned in his way
talk on but talk to the purpose susan
what have he done
thats the question
you aint going to tell me hes done nought suggested mr_head
i aint going to tell you nothing at all because i dont know nothing at all
he wouldnt ax me how to spend his you neither
tell us who hes anybody persisted the man
how is it none havent handed me back my money
you can youve got the pluck to do i want my bit back so well as and mine be quite as much to me as neds thousands was to him
charity begins at home repeated susan and ill lay you my hat though the fogs took the feather out of curl that if he does anything twill be for his own first
hes that sort i believe
they people at cadworthy
yes
not that i think hell do aught but if he does twill be there
mrs ned be taking very to the thought of leaving
lived here all her married life and brought all her there
but got to go
theyre all off after lady day
too much rent wanted by the new owner
same with us said heathman
these here men who have got the places on their hands now pear to think a dartmoor farms a gold mine
me and my mother clear out too
mrs susan drank again
and after this glass one of you chaps will have to see me up over she said
well all come if youll promise another drink at end declared heathman but susan turned to jack
youd best to come jack she declared
he exhibited indifference but she pressed him and he agreed
if ive got a man to look after me theres no hurry she concluded
im in for a as tis
the easy soul stopped on until closing time and then mr_head fulfilled his promise and walked homeward beside her through a foggy night
she rested repeatedly while climbing the hill to the moor and she talked without ceasing
susan was exhilarated and loquacious as the result of too much to drink
head however bore with her and acquired a most startling and unexpected piece of information
he mentioned the attitude of heathman cora and his fiery championship of the dead
i thought hed have come across and hit me down because i told the naked truth about the man
and he denied that his mother was the better by a penny when nathan died
but how about it when he was alive
truths truth answered susan
you might have knocked me down with a feather there what am i saying
he smelt a secret and angled for it
of course youre like one of the ned family yourself and ive no right to ask you things only such a man as me with a credit for sense be different to the talking sort
truths truth as you say and the truth will out
but mr_gollop course she knows nothing
she couldnt keep a secret like you or me
mrs susan stood still again and breathed hard in the darkness
her tongue to tell a tremendous thing known to her but her muddled senses fought against this impropriety
two can often keep a secret that pretty well busts one said mr_head with craft
he believed that humphrey ned was paying some of his brothers debts and since this procedure might reach to him he felt the keenest interest in it
mrs cora did not concern him
he had merely mentioned her
but priscilla was the subject which filled susans mind to the exclusion of all lesser things and she to impart her knowledge
no temptation to confide in another had forced itself upon her until the present yet with wits loosened and honour by drink she now yearned to speak
at any other moment such a desire must have been silenced by reason of the confession of personal wrongdoing that it entailed
now however she did not remember that
she was only lusting to tell and quite forgot how she had learned
thus while head to gain private ends endeavoured to find whether ned was paying his brothers debts susan supposed that his mind ran upon quite another matter the relations between priscilla cora and humphreys dead brother
mrs susan knew the truth
she had acquired it in the manner by listening at the door during an interview between nathans mistress and her master
this tremendous information had burnt her soul to misery ever since but a thousand reasons for keeping the secret existed
her own good name was involved as much as anothers
she could not whisper a word for her credits sake and a cause that weighed far heavier with her was the credit of mr_gollop mr_gollop
mr_gollop had guessed darkly at what susan now knew but as a result of her subterranean hints mr_gollop had suffered in the public esteem for few believed her
to confirm mr_gollop and ratify her implications was quite the last thing that mrs susan would have desired to do and yet such was the magic sleight of alcohol to masquerade in the shape of reason justice and also its potency to conceal now this muddled woman fell
she was intelligent enough to make jack promise on bible oaths that he would keep her secret and then she told him the last thing that he expected to hear
with acute interest he to know humphreys future intentions respecting his brothers creditors instead he listened to widely different facts
ill tell you if youll swear by the book to keep it to yourself
ill be the better for telling it
tis too large a thing for one that gini know tis that have loosed my tongue even while im speaking
and yet why not
youre honest
im sure i cant tell what i ought to do
you might say twas no business of mine and i dont wish one of em any for the wide world do i
ill swear to keep quiet enough my dear woman
and tis your sense not your thimble of liquor makes you want to talk to me
if not me who
im the sort that knows how to keep a secret like the grave knows how to keep its dead
im a friend to you and ned greatest friend you might say
in a word tis natural that young swear your bible you swear that you wont squeak
1 1 squeak break silence
i aint got one but ill swear on yours
you can trust me
twas natural as cora got vexed down there then and you was lucky not to feel the weight of his fist
for why
hes nathans son
gospel truth
all his cora girl and heathman
the mother of em told my master in so many words and i heard her tell him
i was just going into the room but stopped at the door for some reason and before i could get out of earshot id it
there
say you was eavesdropping and have done with it said mr_head
he took this startling news very quietly and advised susan to do the like
the less you think about it the better
whats done be done
we dont know none of the rights of it and im not the sort to blame or their private actions
tis only nathans public actions i jumped on him for and if heathman was twice his son id not fear to speak if twas a matter of justice
i didnt ought to have told you but my minds a sieve if theres a drop of gin in my stomach
i had to let it go tonight
if i hadnt told you what i so like as not id have told ned when i got back and then have out that id listened at the i did god forgive me
susan became but jack renewed his promises and left her tolerably collected
the confession had eased her mind calmed its excitement and silenced her tongue also
jack tried to learn more of the thing that interested him personally but upon that subject she knew nothing
she believed the general report that mr dennis by secret understanding with the lawyer was relieving the poorest of nathans creditors and she inclined to the opinion that her master had no hand in this philanthropy
they parted at the garden wicket of susans home and mr_head left her there but not before she had made him swear again with all solemnity to keep the secret
chapter v as humphrey ned had pointed out to his nephew ned disaster usually hits the weak harder than the strong and the lazy man suffers more at sudden reverses than his neighbour who can earn a living come what trouble may
rupert and his wife were prepared to seek a new home and milly at the bottom of her heart suffered less from these tribulations than any of her husbands relations
the blow had robbed him of nothing since he possessed nothing
to work to win cadworthy was no longer possible but he might do as well and save money as steadily elsewhere and the change in their lives for milly meant something worth having
in her heart was a secret wish that her coming child might be born in her own home
as for her husband he now his time and did not immediately seek work because humphrey ned directed delay
his reason was not given nor would he commit himself to any promise but he offered the advice and rupert took it
mrs neds grief at leaving her home proved excessive
she belonged to the easy sort of people who are glad to trust their affairs in any capable control and she suffered now at this sudden catastrophe even as ned suffered
she had very little money and was constrained to look to her sons for sustenance
it was proposed that she and may should find a cottage at shaugh but to display her poverty daily before eyes that had seen her prosperity was not good to her
she found it hard to decide and finally hoped to continue life in a more distant hamlet
all was still in abeyance and the spring had come
until neds future theatre of toil was certain his mother would not settle anything
she trusted that he might win a respectable post but employment did not offer
hesters youngest son humphrey had been provided for by a friend and he was now working with saul_luscombe milly at
then came a date within six weeks of the familys departure
the packing was advanced and still nothing had been quite determined
ned was anxious and troubled rupert for his uncle to speak
he knew of good work at and it was decided that his mother and may should also move to a cottage in that churchtown unless ned achieved any sort of work within the next few weeks
then his plans might help to determine their own
at this juncture unexpectedly on a march evening came their kinsman from and rupert met him at the outer gate
is your mother here
asked the rider and when he heard that the family was ned who stayed at tavistock on his dismounted and came among them
a litter and disorder marked the hawk_house
there were in every room but less than a moiety of hesters goods would leave her home
she must dwell in a small cottage henceforth and her furniture with much of her china and other precious things was presently destined to be sold
the period of her greatest grief had long passed she had faced the future with resignation for many months and returned to her usual
she and her daughter could even plan their little possessions in a new cottage and smile together again
they had fitted their minds to the changed condition they had calculated the probable result of the sale and mrs ned thrown by these large reverses from her former easy and tranquil optimism had fallen upon the opposite extreme
she now looked for no amelioration of the future foresaw no possibility of adequate work for ned and was as dumb as a wounded horse or cow even at the tragical suggestion of her sons enlistment
this he had openly discussed but finding that none exhibited any horror before the possibility soon dropped it again
to these people came grey saturnine
his eyes were causing him some trouble and their rims were grown red
they thought in secret that he had never looked uglier and he declared openly that he had seldom felt worse
tis the season of the year that always troubles me he said
gout gravel rheumatism at me together
nature is a usurer hester as you may live to find out yet for all you keep so healthy
she bankrupts three parts of the men you meet long afore they pay back the pinch of dust they have borrowed from her
the rate of interest on life runs too high and thats a fact even though you be as thrifty of your powers as you please and a miser of your vital parts as i have always been
your eyes are inflamed seemingly said his
vivians went the same once but doctor soon cured em
they sat in the kitchen and he spoke to may
if youll hurry tea and brew me a strong cup ill thank you
i feel just as if do me a deal of good
she obeyed at once and humphrey exhibiting a most unusual and egotism continued to discuss himself
for all my carcase be under the weather my mind is pretty clear for me
things be going well im glad to say and you might almost think i however no matter for that
perhaps it bant the minute to expect you to take pleasure at any others prosperity
theres nothing like health after all
youll find yourself more peaceful now hester now you know the worst of it
peaceful enough she said
i dont blame myself and tis vain to blame the dead
master trusted his brother nathan like you trust spring to bring the leaves
therefore it was right and proper that i should do the same
twas all put in his hands when vivian died
even if i would have i wasnt allowed to do anything
but of course i trusted nathan too
who didnt
i didnt will bear me out in that
i never trusted him though i envied the wholehearted respect and regard the world paid him
we envy in another whats denied to faults sometimes
yet im pretty cheerful here and therefor me
have you heard any more said about his death and my hand in it
a lot answered mrs ned
and most understanding creatures have quite come round to seeing your side
only a man here and there holds out that you were wrong
i may tell you that the reverend dennis couldnt find no argument against it
he came to see me not long since
he wouldnt be kept to the case in point but argued against the principle at large
when i pinned him to nathan at last he said though reluctantly that he believed he would have done no less for his own brother
thats a pretty good one to
my uncle milly thinks you did the proper thing declared milly
presently may called them to the table and handed humphrey his tea
he thanked her
no sugar he said and you ought not to take none neither may
trouble havent made you grow no narrower at the waist seemingly
the girl tried to smile and her family stared
in this man was an exhibition almost unparalleled
if he ever laughed it was bitterly against the order of things yet now he
the result was somewhat painful and none concealed an emotion of discomfort and restraint
the old man perceived their surprise and returned into himself a little
youll wonder how i come to talk so much about my own affairs perhaps
often that i do i believe
well lets drop em and come to yours
have you found work rupert
i can when you give the word
theres martin at wants me and mother can come there
weve seen two either of which would suit her and may very well
one near the church she likes best
theres a cottage that will fit me and milly not far off
why go and have an expensive move when you can live at shaugh
ive got my feelings answered the widow rather warmly
you cant expect me to go there
ned asked another question
so much for you all then
and what of ned
at tavistock wearing out his trying to find work
if hes only wearing out no harms done
he told us what you offered last year and im sure twas over and above what many men would have done declared neds mother
i was safe to offer it he answered
tis only to say ill double nought
hes not worth a box of matches a week to any man
they very near took him on at the when he offered to go there
but not quite
and that gave him the idea to list in the horse soldiers
he knows all about it along of being in the yeomanry
to enlist
well mans work by all accounts though i hold tis devils work the last mischief satan finds for idle hands to do
it would knock sense into ned all the same argued rupert
the discipline of it would be good for him and he might rise
but hes not done it you say
no answered mrs ned
hes not done it
ive suffered so much for my part that when he broke the dreadful thing upon me i hadnt a tear left to shed
and the calm way i took it rather disappointed him poor fellow
he had a right to expect to see me and may if not rupert terrible stricken at such a thought but weve been through such a lot that we couldnt for the life of us take on about it
im sure we both cried ourselves dry you might cora threw him over but that was the last straw
anything more happening leaves us dazed and stupid like a sheep as watches another sheep being killed
we cant suffer no more
even when ned went out rather vexed because we took it so calm and said hed end his life we didnt do we mother
asked may
no answered hester
we was past doing or caring for ned
besides hes offered to make a hole in the water so terrible often poor dear fellow
twas a case where i felt the lord would look after his own
ned may do some useful thing in the world yet
hes been very brave over this as a lion
tis nought to me
im old and shant be here much longer
but for him and may twas a terrible
neds a zany and ever will be declared humphrey
rupert here is different and never was afraid of work
fortune didnt fall to him and yet twas his good fortune to have to face bad fortune if you understand that
money till you have learned the use of it be a gun in a fools hand and success in any shapes the same
if it comes afore you know the value and power of it tis a curse and a danger
it makes you look awry at life and carry yourself too proud and cometh to harm and bitterness
i know none so well
they did not answer
then may rose and began to collect the tea things
humphrey looked round the dismantled room and his eyes rested on the naked
where are all the
1 he asked
you used to have two big china figures up there
1 ornaments of glass or china
some are packed and some will go into the sale
they two you mean are worth money im told explained mrs ned
then the visitor said a thing that much astonished her
twill give you trouble now he remarked but twill save trouble in the end
let me see them put back again
milly looked at may in wonder
to argue the matter was her first thought but may acted
they be only in the next room with other things to be sold she said
you can see them again uncle if you mind to
rupert spoke while she was from the room
why dont you buy em uncle
theyd look fine at your place
put em back on the shelf answered ned
and whats more you may or may not be glad to know they can stop there
tis a matter of no account at all and i wont have no talk about it but you can feel yourself free to stay hester if youd rather not make a change at your time of life
you must settle it with rupert and your darter
in a word ive had a tell with the owner of the farm and hes agreeable
i know hes agreeable answered humphreys nephew but im not agreeable to his rent
if youd keep your mouth shut till youd heard me be better
i was going to say that mr westcott of cann quarries who foreclosed on the mortgage of this place when your uncle westcott is agreeable to let me have cadworthy and in a word mine
may came in at this moment with the old china figures
she entered a profound silence and returned the puppets to their old places on the mantelpiece
it seemed that this act carried with it support and confirmation of the startling thing that hester ned had just heard
humphrey spoke again
past and snow offering from the north
i must be gone
fetch up my pony rupert and then you can travel a bit of the way back along with me
his nephew was glad to be gone
a highly emotional spirit began to charge the air
hester had spoken to may and her daughter grown white and was trying to speak
you mean we can all stop and rupert can go on here
she said at last
if he thinks it good enough
hed bought back a bit of the place as he thought from ned
i can go into all that with him
and for you youre used to the rounds of cadworthy and im used to your being here
youve done nought but trust a weak man
i dont want all the to be off the plum for you yet
but i till now because youll see looking back that youll be none the worse for smarting a few months
ive all my life and im not very much the worse i suppose
so now ill be gone and you can unpack when you please
2 blue bloom
they could not instantly grasp this great reversal of fortune
be you sure
asked his niece
oh uncle be you sure
sure and sure and double sure
a very good investment with a man like your brother rupert to work it for me
but let him see the rents paid on the nail
he rose and mrs ned tried to rise also but her legs refused to carry her
get my salts she said to milly then she spoke to her
im a bit dashed at such news she began
it have made my bones go to a jelly
tis almost too much at my age
the old cant stand joy like the young better tuned to face trouble
but to stop stop like coming back after id thought i was gone
i cant believe tis true
my god id said goodbye to it all
the worst was over
no it wasnt answered humphrey
you think twas but i know better
the worst would have come the day the cart and you got up and drove off
now cheer yourself and drink a drop of spirits
and dont expect rupert home till late
ill take him back with me to supper
he offered his hand and the woman kissed it
whereupon he uttered a sound of irritation looked wildly at her and at his fingers as though there had been blood upon them instead of tears
milly stopped with mrs ned may went to the door with her uncle and helped him into his coat
i cant say nothing she whispered
it wont bear talking if you knew how i loved mother be quiet he answered
dont you play the fool too
i let you fret to get your fat down a was the main reason i do believe and now youll only get stouter than ever of course
go back to her and lets have no nonsense and mind when i come over again that my hawk_house is tidy
i never see such a jakes of a mess as youve got it in
he went out and met rupert at the gate
youd best to come back with me he said
ive told them youll sup at
twill give em time to calm down
it takes nought to a woman
nought
you call this nought
rupert helped ned on to his pony and walked beside him
it was now nearly dark and a few flakes of snow already fell
winter have for march said humphrey and i for march
you might ask why for i let em have all this trouble
twas done for their good
theyll rate what theyve got all the higher now that it had slipped from them and so will you
rupert said nothing
yes repeated his uncle winter for the new year and so did i
and now tis for you to say whether youll stop at my farm or no
of course ill stop
no silly promises mind
this is business
you neednt be thanking me and in justice weve got to think of that fool your elder brother
but be it as it will tis hesters home for her time
ill stop so long as my mother lives
and a bit after i hope if you dont want to quarrel with me
but i shall be dead myself come to think of it
what shall i forget next
so much for that
well go into figures after supper
i know you dont want no thanks nor nothing of that sort said rupert but you know me pretty well and you know what i feel upon it
tis a masterpiece of goodness in you to do such a thing
say no more
ive killed two birds with one stone as my crafty manner is
thats all
tis a very good farm and ive got it cheap and ive got you to your mother
i benefit usual way in business
they passed along and the snow silenced the footfall of horse and man
near came the sudden elfin cry of a from the darkness of the woods
hush
said humphrey drawing up
list to that
im glad we heard it
a keeper down along boasted to me a week ago that hed shot every owl for a mile round but theres a brave bird there yet looking round for his supper
the owl cried again
tis a sound im very much addicted to explained ned
and likewise im glad to hear the noise of they sporting and the bark of a fox
they be brave things that know no fear and go cheerful through a world of enemies
i respect em
you never kill a snake tis said
not ii never kill nought
a snakes to be pitied not killed
hell meddle with none as dont meddle with him
ive watched em scores an scores o times
they be only humble worms that go upon their bellies dirt low but they gaze upward for ever with their eyes
satan looked thus when they him out of heaven
you beat me said rupert
you can always find excuses for never for men
his uncle
most men are he answered
chapter vi the effect of his financial tribulation on jack was not good
whatever might have been of humphrey neds theories as to the value worldly misfortune and the tonic property of bad luck upon character in this mans case the disappearance of his savings deranged his usual commonsense and indicated that his rational outlook was not based upon sure foundations
from the standpoint of his personal welfare it seemed after all that he appraised life and upon his loss a native and intolerance increased
he grew morose his quality of humour failed him and his mind deprived of this cathartic and salutary sense grew stagnant
at his best jack was never famed for a delicate choice of time or place when pushing his opinions
propriety in this connection he took pleasure in disregarding
he flouted convention and loved best to burst his bombshells where they were most certain to and anger
following the manner of foolish propagandists he seldom selected the psychological moment for his onslaughts nor did he perceive that half the battle in these cases may depend upon nice choice of opportunity
there came an evening some time after he had learnt the secret of the cora family when head returning to shaugh fell in with cora who walked upon the same road
he had never liked her and now remembered certain aggressive remarks recently cast at him by her brother
the man was going slower than the woman and had not meant to take any notice of her but the somewhat nod she gave him touched his spleen and he quickened his pace and went along beside her
hold on he said ill have a tell with you
often you hear sense i believe
cora for once in a mood wholly seraphic over private affairs showed patience
im in a bit of a hurry but ive always got time to hear sense she said
thus unexpectedly met mr_head found himself with nothing to say
one familiar complaint at that time running against cora for the moment he forgot
therefore he fell back upon her brother
you might tell heathman i was a good bit crossed at the way he spoke to me two nights
ive as much right to my opinion as him and if i say that the late nathan ned was no better than he should be and not the straight man he made us im only saying what everybody knows
thats true she said
certainly a good many people know that
exactly so
then why for does he jump down my throat as if i was the dead
truths truth and it bant a crime to tell the truth about a man after hes dead any more than it be while hes alive
more it is
very often you dont know the truth till a mans dead
my brothers a bit soft
all the same you must speak of people as you find them
and heathman had no quarrel with ned though most sensible people had seemingly
he was a tricky man and nobody can pretend he was honest or straight
hes left a deal of misery behind him
the relationship between cora and nathan ned suddenly flashed into jacks memory
her remark told him another fact he judged from it that she could not be aware of the truth
it seemed improbable that cora could utter such a sentiment if she knew that she spoke of her father
then he remembered how heathman certainly knew the truth and he assumed that cora must also know it
she was therefore revealing her true thoughts secure in the belief that since her companion would be ignorant of the relationship between her and the dead she need pretend to no conventional regard before him
at another time jack might have approved her frankness but today he designed to quarrel and chose to be angered at this spirit
upon that subject his mouth was sealed but there returned to him the recollection of her last achievement
he reminded her of it and rated her bitterly
very well for you to talk of dishonest men and crooked dealings he retorted
you that dont know the meaning of a straight that flung over one chap and made him hang himself and now have flung over another
you may and flirt and walk quick but ill walk quick too and i tell you youre no better than a greedy good for nought
you chuck ned after keeping him on the hooks for years
and why
because he came down in the world with a run and you knew that youd have to work if you took him and couldnt wear fine feathers and ape the beastly people who drive about in carriages
her lips tightened and she flashed at him
you stupid fool
she said
you of all others to blame who were never tired of out what a worthless thing the man was
you ought to be the first to say hes properly punished and the first to say im doing the right thing and so you would but just because youve lost a few dirty pounds you go yelping and snarling at everybody
youre so mighty clever that perhaps youll tell me why i should marry a pauper who cant find work far or near because hes never learnt how to work
why must i keep in with a man like that and get children for him and kill myself for him and go on the parish at the end
youre so fond of putting everybody right perhaps youll put me right
the other was not prepared for this vigorous counterattack
very well for you to storm he said but you only do it to hide your own cowardly nature
you pretended you was in love with him and took his gifts and made him think you meant to marry him and stick up for him for better for worse but far from it
you was only in love with his cash and hadnt got no use for the man
im not saying you would do well to marry him for the minute but to chuck him when hes down youre a most other men she answered
tis so easy for you frosty creatures with no more feeling than a frog to talk about love and waiting
there you make a sane woman wild
waiting what becomes of me while im waiting
im a lovely woman you old fool dont you understand what that means
will time wait
look at the coming
look at the line betwixt my eyebrows and the lines from my nose each side to the corners of my mouth
will they wait
no curse em they get deeper and deeper and no rubbing will rub em out and no waiting will make them lighter
so easy to about faithfulness and patience if youre ugly as a gorilla and flat as a pancake
im lovely and im a pauper and ive got nought but loveliness to stand between me and a rotten life and a rotten death in the
so there it is
dont preach no more of your cant to me for i wont have it
she was furious the good things in her mind had slipped for the moment away
while uttering this tirade she stood still and mr_head did the like
he saw her argument perfectly well
he perceived that she had reason on her side but her impatience and scorn angered him
her main position he could not shake but he turned upon a minor issue and made feeble retort
his answer failed dismally in every way
of its smallness and weakness she took instant advantage and further it reminded her of the satisfactory event that mr_head had for the moment banished from her mind
hard words wont make the case better for you he began
and to be outside is nought if youre damned ugly inside and thats what you be and thats what everybody very well knows by now
she sneered at him
parsons poor at that
if you want to that sort of trash youd better ask mr dennis to teach you how
you of all wise and such a
whats the good of telling that to me
tis the outside we see and the outside we judge by and for the rest youll do well to mind your own business and not presume to lecture your betters
very grand
very high and mighty to be sure
thats how you talked to humphrey ned i suppose and got a flea in your ear for your pains
and ill give you another
tis the inside that matters and not the out though your empty mind thinks different
and mark this youll go begging now till youre an old woman and be long before youll have your age dashed in your face by every female you anger
yes youll go begging will have will take you with your record behind you
an old maid youll be and an old maid youll deserve to be
you just chew the end of that
what a beast you are
she retorted
what a cowardly creature to strike a woman so
but you spoke too soon as usual
the likes of you to dare to say that
you that dont know so much about women as you do about rabbits
i know enough about men anyhow and i know no man will ever look at you again
liar
a man asked me to marry him months ago
but little did i think youd be the first to know it when we decided that it should be known
he asked and he was a man worth calling one and i took him so you may just swallow your own lies again and choke yourself with em
youre terrible fond of saying everybodys a twill take you all your time to find a bigger one than yourself after today
and dont you never speak to me again because i wont have it
like your common labouring to have spoke to me at all
and if you do again ill tell mr timothy timothy to put his whip round your shoulders so now then
him
yes him and now you can go further off and keep further off in future
she hastened forward to carry her news to other ears and jack stood still until she was out of sight
he felt exceedingly angry but his anger swiftly diminished and he even found it possible to laugh at himself before he reached shaugh
he knew right well that he must look a fool but the knowledge did not increase his liking for cora
he reflected on what he had heard and saw her making fun of him in many quarters
he even debated a revenge but no way offered
once he speculated as to what her betrothed would say if he knew the truth of coras paternity but to do him justice not the faintest thought of revealing the secret tempted jack
leave it and shell most likely wreck herself with him he thought
timothys a sharp chap and not easily hoodwinked
so like as not when hes seen a bit of her mean soul hell think twice while theres time
mr_head began to reflect again upon his own affairs and finding himself at the vicarage gate went in and asked for dennis dennis
the rumour persisted and even grew that dennis was paying back certain losses incurred at nathan neds death among the poorest of the community
the fact had wounded sense of justice and he was determined to throw some light on denniss foggy philanthropy
the vicar happened to be in and soon mr_head appeared before him
their interview lasted exactly five minutes and jack was in the street again
he explained his theory at some length and gave it as his opinion that to pick and choose the cases was not defensible
he then explained his own loss and invited mr dennis to say whether a more deserving and unfortunate man might be found within the quarters of the parish
the clergyman listened patiently and answered with brevity
i hear some of the people are being helped but personally the donor is not known to me
i have nothing to do with it
he or a lady for they do that sort of thing not responsible to anybody but as far as i have heard a very good choice has been made among the worst sufferers
as to your case jack it isnt such a very hard one
you are strong and hale still and youve got nobody to think of but yourself
we know at any rate that nathan ned did a lot of good with other peoples money
isnt that what you socialists are all wanting to do
but i dare say this misfortune has modified your views a little here and there
ive never yet met a man with fifty pounds in the bank who was what i call a socialist
to you jack
chapter vii alice dennis the vicars sister came in to speak with dennis after jack had gone
he was composing a sermon but set it aside at once for the tone of her voice declared that she could brook no denial
its joe_voysey she said
im sorry to trouble you about him again but hes got bronchitis
well send him some soup or something
has that last dozen of parish port all gone yet
i was thinking of another side to it she confessed
dont you think this might be an excellent opportunity to get rid of him
isnt that rather hitting a man when hes down
well its perfectly certain youll never hit him when hes up again
if you only realised how the man robs i mean
he doesnt actually steal i suppose but look at the seed and the thousand and one things hes always wanting in the garden and nothing to show but weeds
you must be fair alice
there are miles of large fat cabbages out there
cabbages yes and when i almost go down on my knees for one he says theyre not ready and mustnt be touched
he caught the cook getting a sprig of parsley yesterday and was most insolent
she says that if he opens his mouth to her again shell give warning and she means it
and even you know that cooks are a thousand times harder to get than gardeners
dennis sighed and looked at his manuscript
funny you should say these preaching about the fruits of the earth next sunday
the mans ready with an excuse
the garden must be swarming with every blight and horror that was ever known according to him
and somehow i always feel hes being impertinent all the time hes speaking to me though theres nothing you can catch hold of
now its mice and now its birds and now its canker in the air or some nonsense and now its the east wind and now its the west sick of it and if you ask for an onion he reminds you with quite an injured air that he took three into the hawk_house last week
theres a wretched cauliflower we had ages ago and hes always talking about it still as if it had been a pineapple at least
i know hes tiresome
i tell you till hes back and then ill give him a serious talking to
only two days ago i met him lumbering up with that ridiculous basket he always will huge thing large enough to hold a sack of potatoes
and in the bottom were three ridiculous little from the frame about as long as your thumb
i remonstrated and of course he was ready
i know to a leaf what his reverence eats he said and if that woman in the kitchen a cook dont serve em up proper thats not my fault
he didnt seem to think i ever ate anything out of the garden
old scoundrel
ill talk to him severely
ive had a rod in pickle ever since last year
dennis laughed suddenly but his sister was in no laughing mood
i really cant see the funny side she declared
of course not
there is none
hes a fraud but i remembered what travers said last recollect
the thrips and bug and all sorts of things got into the vines and we asked travers what was the matter and he explained what a shameful muddle joe_voysey had made
then when had gone chattering off saying the grapes were worth five shillings a pound in open market and that theyd only lost their bloom because we kept fingering them travers said he looked as if he was infested with thrips and mealy bug himself
i shall always laugh when i think of was so jolly true
i hate a man who never owns that he is wrong and i do wish youd get rid of him
its only fair to me
i have but few pleasures and the garden is one of them
he tramples and tears and if you venture to ask him to you know what happens
the next morning the garden looks as though there had been a plague of locusts in has gone
he ought to retire but hes saved nothing worth mentioning poor old fool
thats his affair
it ought to be but you know well enough that all round is my affair
we are faced with it everywhere
head has just been in here
theres a rumour about the poor people that the innkeeper swindled
he took their savings and theres nobody to pay them back now hes gone
but it seems that here and there those hit had their money again
not your work i hope alice
but i know what you do with your cash
joe_voysey was talking about it a little time ago and i blamed him for not having saved some money himself by this time
he said better spend what you earn on yourself than give it to somebody else to save for you
the misfortunes of the people seemed to have pleased him a good deal
wem mostly in the same box now he said but i had the rare sense to spend my brass myself
ive had the value of it in beer and tobacco if no other way
detestable old man
and no better
anybody but you would have got rid of them both years and years ago
they must retire simply must
theyre the two eldest men in the parish
and of course youll pension them or some such nonsense
indeed i shall do no such thing
perhaps this is the end of joe_voysey
he may see the sense of retiring now
not he
hell be ill for six weeks and lie very snug and comfortable drawing his money at home then when the weather gets to suit him hell crawl out again
and everything that goes wrong all through next year will be owing to his having been laid by
ill talk to him repeated her brother
ill talk to him and mr_gollop together
mr_gollop has pretty well exhausted my patience i assure you
miss dennis left him with little hope and he resumed his sermon on the fruits of the earth
but next sunday the unexpected happened and thomas even in the clergymans opinion exceeded the bounds of decency by a scandalous omission
it happened thus
the sexton going his rounds before morning service was confronted with an unfamiliar object in the churchyard
a tombstone had sprung up above the dust of nathan ned
he rubbed his eyes with astonishment because the time for a memorial was not yet and thomas must first have heard of it and made ready before its erection
here however stood what appeared to be a square slate similar in design to those about it but investigation proved that an imitation stone had been set up and upon the boards painted to resemble slate was inscribed a ribald obituary notice of the dead
it scoffed at his pretensions stated the worst that could be said against him and concluded with a in verse that consigned him to the devil
now by virtue of his office apart from the fact of being a responsible man enlisted on the side of all that was and decorous should have removed this offence as quickly as possible before any eye could mark it
thus he would have disappointed those of the baser sort who had placed it there by night and arrested an outrage before any harm was done by it
but instead he studied the inscription with the liveliest interest and found himself much in sympathy therewith
here was the worlds frank opinion on nathan ned
the innkeeper deserved such a censure and thomas saw no particular reason why he should interfere
he was alone and none had observed him
therefore he shuffled off and rather than fetch his spade and barrow to dig up this calumny and remove it left the board for others to discover
this they did before the bells began to ring and when dennis dennis entered the churchyard on his way to the vestry he was arrested by the sight of a considerable crowd collected about the ned graves
the people were trampling over the mounds and standing up on the monuments to get a better view
on the outskirt of the gathering was ben north in a state of great excitement but singlehanded the policeman found himself unable to cope with the crowd
a violent quarrel was proceeding at the centre of this human ring and dennis heard voice and that of heathman cora
dennis ordered some yelling choirboys down off a flat tomb then pushed his way through his congregation
parties had been divided as to the propriety of the new monument and the scene rather resembled that in the past when nathan ned was buried
as the vicar arrived heathman cora who had lost his was just knocking backwards into the arms of his sister
the man and woman fell together and with cries and hisses others turned on heathman
then a force rallied to the rescue
sunday hats were hurled off and trampled into the grass sunday coats were torn sunday collars were fouled
not until half a dozen men still fighting had been thrust out of the churchyard was dennis able to learn the truth
then he examined the cause of the riot and listened to cora
the young man was bloody and breathless but he gasped out his tale
a dozen people were already inspecting the new gravestone when heathman passed the church on his way to chapel with his mother and sisters
he left them to see the cause of interest and discovering it ordered mr_gollop instantly to remove it
this the sexton declined to do on the ground that it was sunday
thereupon fetching tools heathman himself prepared to dig up the monument
but he was prevented
many of the people approved of the joke and decreed that the board must stand
they arrested heathman in his efforts to remove it
then others took his side and endeavoured to drag down the monument
having heard both cora and mr_gollop the clergyman read the mock inscription
mean to say that you refuse to remove this outrageous thing
he asked the sexton but thomas was in no mood for further reprimand
he had suffered a good deal in credit and temper
now he mopped a bleeding nose and was insolent
yes i do and i wont break the fourth commandment for you or fifty parsons
who the mischief be you to tell me to labour on the lords day i should like to know
youll bid me covet my neighbours ass and take my neighbours wife next perhaps
and when alls said this writing be true and a lesson to the parish
let em have the truth for once though it do turn their tender stomachs
get out of the churchyard you old blackguard
cried heathman
youre a disgrace to any persuasion and you did ought to be hounded out of a decent village
leave mr_gollop to me cora
now lend a hand here a few of you get this infamous thing away and destroyed before anybody else sees it
and the rest go into church at once
put on your quick you boys and you jenkins tell miss dennis to play another voluntary
dennis issued his orders and then helped to dig up this outrage among the tombs
thomas and his sister departed together
ben north cora and another assisted mr dennis
then came humphrey ned upon his way to church and despite the entreaty of the young clergyman that he would not read the thing set up over nathans grave insisted on doing so
i hear in the street theres been a row about a tombstone to my brother
who put it there
tis too soon by half
i shall lift a stone to the man when the proper time comes he said
it isnt a stone its an unseemly outrage
not the work of shaugh men i hope
i shall investigate the thing to the bottom answered dennis
let me see
stay your hand cora
the old man put on his glasses deliberately and read the evil words
tear it down he said
that bant all the truth about the man and half the truth is none
quick away with it
theres my from cadworthy coming into the gate
the burlesque tombstone was hurried away and dennis went into the vestry
others entered church and heathman at last found himself alone
the bells stopped the organ ceased to grunt and the service proceeded but young cora was only concerned with his own labours
he ransacked adjoining the vestry
it was locked but he broke it open and finding a hatchet there proceeded to make splinters of the offending inscription
he chopped and chopped until his usual equitable humour returned to him
then the work completed he returned to his fathers grave and repaired the broken mound
he was engaged upon this task to the murmur of the psalms when jack approached and bade him
a pretty i hear
and you in the midst of
i was and id do the same for any chap that did such a beastly thing
if i thought you had any hand in it jack the other remembered that the son of the dead was speaking to him
not me he answered
i have a pretty big grudge against nathan ned that was and i wont deny it but this on his no better than to kick the dead
besides whats the use
it wont right the wrong or put my money back in my pocket
how did it words i mean
ive forgot em answered heathman
least said mended and if it dont do one thing and that is get mr_gollop the sack i shall be a bit astonished
he laughed
you should a seen the old monkey just now
he was the first to mark this job and he let it stand for all to see and was glad they should see to him
wrote it himself so like as not
hadnt the wit to
but he left it and he was well pleased at it
and then when i ordered him as sexton to take it down he wouldnt and so i lost my head and gave him a tap on the ribs and over he went into his sisters arms as was standing screeching like a just behind him
both dropped then tom sparkes hit me in the mouth and so we went on very lively till mr dennis came
wouldnt have missed it for money said jack
but just my luck to be side the village at such a moment
he sat down on a sepulchre and filled his pipe
he knew well why heathman had thrown himself so fiercely into this quarrel and he admired him for it
the sight of the young man reminded him of his sister
so your cora is trying a third she tells me
yes tis tim timothy this time answered coras brother
i shouldnt envy him any man who had to live his life along with her
youre right there no what was left out when she was
she told me the news a bit ago just when i was giving her a rap over the knuckles on account of that other fool ned
and she got the best of the allow that
in fact you might say she scored off me proper for i told her that no decent chap would ever look at her again and what does she answer
why that tim timothys took her
yes tis so
he and me was talking a bit ago
hell rule her
but i got it back on cora continued mr_head
im not the sort to be beat in argument and forget it
not i
ill wait if need be for a month of sundays afore i make my answer but i always laugh last and none dont ever get the of me for long
and last week i caught up with her again as we was travelling by the same road and i gave her hells delights and told her the ugly truth about herself till she could have strangled me if shed been strong enough
i know you did
she came home in a pretty with temper and shes going to tell timothy about it
but dont you sing small jack dont you let timothy bully you
no man bullies me said head least and last of all a young man
timothy have too much sense i should hope to fall foul of me
but if it comes to that i can give him better than hell give mea long sight better too
the cadworthy people have been a bit off us since cora dropped ned declared heathman
no wonder neither but my mothers cruel about it
her fault however
still thats how it lies
mr_head was examining this situation when the people began to come out of church
he rose therefore and went his way while heathman also departed
many returned to the outraged grave but all was restored to order and nothing remained to see
chapter viii jack presently carried his notorious grievances to humphrey ned and upon him one evening in summer time
they had not met for many weeks and jack though he found little leisure to mark the ways of other people at this season could not fail to note a certain cheerfulness in the master of
humphreys saturnine spirit was at rest for the moment
tonight he talked upon a personal topic and found evident pleasure in a circumstance which from the standpoint of his visitor appeared exceedingly trivial
the usual relations of these men seemed changed and ned showed the more reasonable and contented mind while jack displayed an active distrust of everything and everybody
i wanted a bit of a tell with you he began and thought i might come over
come in and welcome answered humphrey
i hope i see you pretty middling
yes well enough for that matter
and you
never better
tis how the be holding of lemons
you might stare but tis a remedy of doctors
lemon of it
should have reckoned there was enough lemon in your nature without adding to it
enough and to spare
yet you neednt rub that home today
ive heard a thing thats very much pleased me i may tell you
last news such a cranky and uncomfortable man as me might have expected
wish i could hear that would please me im sure said jack
but all that ever i hear of nowadays is other peoples good luck
and theres nothing more damned uninteresting after a bit
not that i grudge of course you with your high opinions
youve said to me a score of times that theres no justice in the world therefore tis no use your fretting about not getting any
we must take things as we find them
and whats your luck then
more money rolling in i suppose
my to call look over large to another
tis that my nephew rupert and his wife want for me to be godfather to their babe
the child will be called after me and im to stand godfather and ill confess to you in secret that im a good deal pleased about it
jack sniffed and spat into the fire
he took a pipe out of his pocket stuffed it and lighted it before he answered
i was going to say that little things please little minds but i wont he began
if you can find pleasure in such a fortunate
i should have reckoned with all the misery there is in the world around you that thered be more pain than pleasure in he broke off
tis the thought explained ned
it shows that they young people feel towards me a proper and respectful feeling
it shows that theyd trust me to be a godparent to this newborn child
i know very well that folk are often asked just for the sake of a silver spoon or a christening mug but my nephew rupert and his wife milly be very different to that
theres no in them
theyve thought this out and reckoned im the right as i am
and naturally i feel well satisfied about it
let that be then
if youre pleased their object be gained for naturally they want to please you
why not
you must die sooner or later though nobodys better content than me to hear doing so clever just at present
but go you must and then theres your mighty fortune got to be left to something or somebody
not the word jack
bant it
then a little bird tells the people a lot of lies
and talking of cash im here over that matter myself
but humphrey was not interested in cash for the moment
they sent me a very letter on the subject he continued
on the subject of the child
twas more respectful to me and less familiar to put it in they thought
and ive written back a long letter and you shall hear just how i wrote if you please
theres things in my letter id rather like you to hear
mr_head showed impatience and the other was swift to mark it
another time if tis all the same to you jack replied
let me get off whats on my chest first
then ill be a better listener
i got much use for secondhand wisdom for the moment
ned had already picked up his letter but now he flung the pages back upon his desk and his manner changed
speak he said
you learn me a lesson
bant often im wrapped up in my own affairs i believe
i beg your pardon head
no need to do that
only seen from my point with all my misfortunes and troubles on my mind this here business of naming a newborn looks very small
you cant picture it no with your riches and your money breeding like rabbits
but for a man such as me to see the sweat of his brow swept away all at a else looks of much account
havent you got over that yet
no i havent and more wouldnt you if somebody had hit you so hard
say your say then if twill do you any sort of good
what i want to know is this
why for do lawyer mr_popham help one man and not help
why do this dare say you know who what hes doing and pick and choose according to his fancy
it isnt dennis or id have him a bit of my mind about it
and if i could find out who it was i would do so
the grievance is that you dont get your bit back
are you the only one
no im not
theres a lot more going begging the same way
and if you know the man you can tell him from me that he may think hem doing a very fine thing but in my opinion he isnt
ned had relapsed into his old mood
so much for your sense that pride yourself such a lot on being the only sane man among us
have you ever looked into the figures
ive looked into my own figures and they be all i care about
exactly so
but them that want to right this wrong have looked into all the figures and so they know a great deal more about em than you do
youre not everybody
youre a hale hearty creature getting good wages
more than one man that put away money with my brother is dead long ago and there are women and children to be thought upon and a bedridden widow and two twin boys both weak in the head and a few other such items
why for shouldnt there be picking and choosing
if youd been going to lend a hand yourself and do a bit for charity wouldnt you pick and choose
bant all life picking and choosing
women and first is the rule in any shipwreck i or ashore
and if you was such a born fool as to trust because others trusted and follow the rest like a sheep follows his neighbour sheep then i should reckon you deserve to whistle for your money
if this chap who was fond of my brother and be set on clearing his name will listen to me you and the likes of you will have to wait a good few years yet for your you ever get it at all
you ought to know as would shoulder in afore the weak
and now you can go
i dont want to see you no more till youve got into a larger frame of mind
what a you be
said head rising and fiercely
so much for christian charity and doing to your neighbour as you would have him do to much for all your cant about righteousness
you all
your turn will come to smart some day
and if i find out this precious fool whos got money to squander ill talk a bit of sense to him too
hes no right to do things by halves and one mans claim on that scamp your brother is just as lawful and proper as another mans and because a person be poor or not poor dont make any difference in the matter of right and wrong
thats where youre so blind as any other beetle snarled back humphrey
for my part ive looked into the figures myself and i quite agree with nathans friend
none has a shadow of reason to question him or to ask for a penny from him
tis his bounty not your right
very easy to talk like that
why dont you put your fingers in your own pocket and lend a hand yourself
not sneaking old curmudgeon
and then want people to think well of you
why the devil should they
that you are
and hark to this miser ned dont you pretend your nephew wants you to stand gossip for his bleating baby to pleasure you
tis because hes got his lifting on your dross
whos like to care for you for yourself
not a dog
your face be enough to turn milk sour and give the fits
get along with you answered humphrey
all men
i could never have believed
and all for pounds fifteen and
so much for your wisdom and reason
be off and get down on your knees if theyll bend and ask god to forgive you
head and swore
then he picked up his hat and departed in a towering rage
neds anger lasted a shorter time
he walked to the window threw it open listened to heads explosive departure and then when silence was restored humphrey himself went to his doorstep and looked out upon the fair june night
mars and a moon nearly full sailed south together through skies and beneath them lay first a low horizon whose contour smoothed by nights hand into dim darkness showed neither point nor peak under the stars
beneath all there shone silver radiance of and luminous in the moonlight
apparently quiescent this vapour in truth drifted with ghostly proper motion before the night wind and stole from the upward toward the high places of the moor
against these shifting passages of fog laid along the skirts of forest and above the murmuring ways of a hidden river ascended silhouettes of trees all black and still against the pearly light behind them
the vapour spread in wreaths and filaments of moisture intermingled
seen afar it was still as standing water but to one moving beside it the mist appeared as on a trembling loom where moonlight wove in ebony and silver
the fabric broke fell asunder and then built itself up once more
again it and into separate shades that seemed to live
from staple of streams from the cold heart of a nightly river were the shadows born and they and spirits of the for selene on high
only when red mars descended and the moon went down did these forlorn phantoms of vapour shrink and shudder and lie closer for comfort to the water mother that bore them
hither nigh midnight in a frame of mind much out of tune with the nocturnal peace passed jack upon his homeward way
his loss had now become a sort of mental obsession and he found it daily wax into a mightier outrage on humanity
he would have suffered in silence but for the aggravation of these events whereby from time to time one or another of the wounded found his ill fortune healed
examination might have showed an impartial mind that much method distinguished the process of this alleviation
those responsible for it clearly possessed close knowledge of the circumstances and they used it to minister in turn to the chief sufferers
the widows and fatherless were first indemnified then others who least could sustain their losses
a sane system marked the procedure but not in the eyes of mr_head
first he disputed the right of any philanthropist to select and single out in such a matter and next when defeated in argument on that contention he fell back upon his own disaster and endeavoured to show how his misfortune was among the hardest and most
that man after man should be compensated and himself ignored roused jack to a pitch of the liveliest indignation
he became a nuisance and people fled from him and his inevitable topic of speech
and now he had heard humphrey ned upon the subject and found him as indifferent as the rest of the world
the old mans argument still revolved in jacks head and too late came answers to it
he moved along in the very extremity of rage and humphrey might have to hear the things that his former friend thought against him
then as ill chance willed another came through the night and spoke to head
timothy timothy went happily upon his homeward way and found himself in a mood as sweet as jacks was the reverse
for timothy was lovemaking and his ladys ripe experience enabled her to give him many pleasant hours of this amusement
neither was sentimental but cora accustomed to the ways and fancies of the courting male affected a certain amount of femininity and timothy appreciated this and told himself that his future wife possessed a womans charms combined with a mans practical sense
he was immensely elated at the thing he had done and he felt gratified to find that miss cora made a most favourable impression amid his friends and relations
now moved thereto by his own cheerful heart he gave jack good night in a friendly tone of voice and added a beautiful evening sure enough
the way was overshadowed by trees and neither man recognised the other until timothy spoke
then mr_head feeling himself within the atmosphere of a happy being a answer and made himself known
thereon timothys manner changed and he regretted his amenity
is that head
he asked in an altered tone
you know my voice i suppose
yes i do
i want to speak to you
and i have meant to for some time past
but the chance didnt offer as you dont go to church or any respectable place and i dont frequent publics
the other bristled instantly
what the hells the matter with you
he shouted
nothings the matter with me
but theres a lot the matter with you by all accounts and since you cant keep a civil tongue in your head its time your betters took you in hand a bit
jack stared speechless at this blunt attack
the moon whitened his face his lean jaw dropped and his teeth
well im damned
my
yes no need for any silly pretence with me
you know what i think of your blackguard opinions and all that rot about equality and the rest
im not here to preach to you but i am here to tell you to behave yourself where ladies are concerned
miss cora has told me what you said to her and she complained sharply about it
you may think it was very clever but id have you to know it was very impertinent coming from you to her
why if id been by id have you
and if it happens again i will
youre a lot too familiar with people and seem to think youve a right to talk to everybody and anybody in a free and easy parson downwards
but let me tell you you forget yourself
id not have said these things if youd been rude to any less person than the young lady im going to marry
but that i wont stand and i order you not to speak to miss cora again
learn what youve got to do
having uttered this admonition mr timothy was proceeding but jack stopped him
i listened to you very patient he said
now youve got to listen to me and listen you shall
why god stiffen it you bumbling fool
who think you are and who think any man is
you be china to my i suppose
and who was your grandfather
come now speak up who was he
im not going to told you what i wish you to do
it doesnt matter who my grandfather was
you know who i am and thats enough
it is enough said jack its enough to make a toad laugh but i dont laughing matter to me to be told by a vain booby like you that im not good enough to have speech with people
and that coming on what ive just heard
if it dont make me sick with human nature and all the breed
be sick with yourself answered timothy
i dont want to be too hard on an uneducated and man but when it comes to insulting women somebody must intervene
by way of answer the older man turned walked swiftly to timothy and struck him on the breast
the blow was a hard one and served its purpose
timothy hit back and head closed
you blackguard anarchist shouted the farmer
you will have it will you
then take it
jack found himself no match for a strong and angry man full years his junior and he reaped a very unpleasant harvest of blows for the master of carried an ash sapling and when he had thrown mr_head to the ground he put his foot on him and flogged him heartily without heeding where his strokes might fall
head yelled and cursed and tried to reach the others legs and bring him down
a column of dust rose into the moonlight and timothys breath steaming upon the air
then with a last cruel cut across the defeated labourers shoulders he released him and went his way
but head was soon up again and with a bleeding face a torn hand and a dusty jacket he followed his enemy
rage is shrewd of inspiration
he remembered the one blow that he could deal this man and he struck it hoping that it might sink far deeper than the smarting that now made his own body ache

he screamed out
you that hit old men in the to me
timothy stopped
if you want any more you can have it he answered
but dont go telling lies around the country and saying i did anything you didnt well deserve
you struck me first and if you are mad enough to strike your betters then youll find they will strike back
ill ill fear that
ill harder blow than your evil hand knows how
ill strike with thats a weapon goes deeper than your bullys stick
hear me and hear a bit about your young lady
a woman without a child her mother where and then go to blazing and your nameless female both
i ill tell you if you want to know
shes nathan neds what your young lady is
theres gall for yours
theres stroke for stroke
and see which of us smarts longest now
jack took his bruises homeward and the other dazed at such a storm also went his way
he scoffed at such malice and put this evil thing behind him
he hastened forward as one hastens from sudden incidence of a foul smell
but the wounded man had sped a poison more far than any born of physical cause
the germ thus despatched grew while timothy slept and with morning light its dimensions were increased
under the moon he had laughed at this furious and scorned it as the vile imagining of a beaten creature but with daylight he laughed no longer
the barb was fast other rumours set floating after the innkeepers death now like lesser arrows into his bosom and mr timothy felt that until a drastic operation was performed and these wounds cleansed his peace of mind would not return
he debated between the propriety of speaking to cora about her father or to mrs cora on the subject of her husband and he decided that the latter course would be more proper
chapter ix susan and her master sat together in the kitchen
he had lighted his pipe she was clearing away the remains of a somewhat scanty meal and she was grumbling loudly as she did so
leave it he cried at length or i wont show you the christening mug for baby
it have come from plymouth and a rare fine glittering thing it is
i wont leave it she answered
you cant see the end of this but i can
people know youve got plenty of money but they dont know the way youre fooling it about and presently when you go and get ill and your bones begin to stick through your skin tis i shall be blamed
not a bit of it
they all think im a miser dont they
let em go on thinking it
tis the way of a misers bones to stick out through his skin
everybody knows that i live cheap from choice and always have
i hate the time given to eating and drinking
youve always lived like a labouring man she admitted
but of late here and there people be more friendly towards you because you let your folk bide at cadworthy and im sick and tired of hearing hester ned tell me you dont eat enough and rupert and milly too
then theres that mr_gollop woman and a few other females have said things against me about the way i run this hawk_house
and tis bad to suffer it for the lord knows ive got enough on my mind without their lies
get em off your mind then he answered
youre a changed woman of late and ill tell you whats done it
i only found out myself a bit ago and said nought but now i will speak
ive wondered these many weeks what had come over you and three days since i discovered
and who was it think told me
her guilty heart thumped at susans ribs
not jack
she asked
jack
no
what does he know about you
jacks another changed creature
he was pretty good company once but his losses have soured him
jack
twas the reverend dennis
youve signed the pledge i hear
hed no business to tell declared susan
yes i have signed it
im a wicked woman and never another drop shall pass my lips
tis that thats made you cranky all the same he declared
you was accustomed to your tipple and you miss it
however im the last to say you did wrong in signing
when your organs get used to going without youll find yourself better company again
and dont worry about the table i keep
i live low from choice not need
it suits me to starve a bit
im the better and for it
but then she took up the analysis and explained to him whence his good health and spirits had sprung
bant that at all
tis what you be doing have got into your blood
i know
youve hid it from all of em but you havent hid it from me
i dont clean up all the rubbish you make and sift your basket for nought
i itch to let it out
but god forgive me ive let out enough in my time
he turned on her angrily then fearlessly she met his frown and he subsided
youre a dangerous prying woman he said and you ought to be ashamed of yourself
im all that she admitted and shame isnt the word
im ashamed enough and more than ashamed
if you let out a breath of my little games ill pack you off into the street that very day susan
she sat down by the fire and took her knitting off the peat box where it was usually to be found
you neednt fear me she answered
ive had my lesson
if ever i tell again what i should not you may kick me into the gutter
he mused over the thoughts that she had awakened
i know a deal more about the weaknesses of my brother nathan now than ever i did while the man was in life he began
he was always giving whether he had it to give or whether he hadnt
im not defending him but i know what it felt like a bit now
giving be like drink it grows on a man the same as liquor does
nathan ought to have taken the pledge against giving
and yet tis just another example of how the bible word never errs
on the face of it youd think twas better fun to receive than to give
but that isnt so
once break down the natural inclination shared by the dog with his bone to stick to what youve make yourself hand over a bit to somebody youll find a wonderful interest arise out of it
some might
some would break their hearts if they had to fork out like youve been doing of late
they be the real misers
to them their stuff is more than food and life and the welfare of the nation
and even them if we could tear their gold away from them might thank us after theyd got over the operation and found themselves better instead of worse without it
all thats too deep for me she answered
the thing thats most difficult to me be this how do you get any good out of helping these poor folk all underhand and unknown
surely if a man or woman does good to others hes a right to the only payment the poor can make him
and thats gratitude
why wont you out with it and let them thank you
youre wrong he said
ive lived too many years in the world to want that
im a fool here and there susan but im not the sort of fool that asks from men and women whats harder to give than any other thing
to put a under an obligation is to have a faith in human nature that i never have had and never shall have
no i dont want that payment im getting better value for my money than that
so long as youre satisfied silence followed and each pursued a private line of thought
humphrey puffed his pipe susan knitted and her wooden needles tapped and rattled a regular tune
she was wondering whether the confession that she desired to make might be uttered at this auspicious moment
her conscience tortured her and it was the weight of a great misery on her mind not the fact of giving up liquor that had of late soured her temper
she had nearly strung herself to tell him of her sins when he from the depths of his being spoke again
but he was scarcely conscious of a listener
to think that a man like meso dark and think that even such a mani that thought my heart was cracked for ever when my son that said to myself no more no more can any earthly thing fret you now
and yet all the time like a withered dry as was that within that only wanted heat to the pulp of meto plump me out again
to think that the like of me must have some other thing toto cherish and foster
to think my heartstrings could ever stretch and seek for aught to twine around again
whod believe it of such a man as me
god
i didnt believe it of myself
but i it said susan
you always went for people to think a bit kindly of you you always fretted when decent folk didnt like you
not that now
i wanted their goodwill but ive found something a lot higher than that
to see a poor soul happy is better far than to see em grateful
what does that matter
to mark their downward eye uplifted again to note their fear for the future gone to see hope creep back to em to watch em walk cheerful and work cheerful to know they laugh in their going once more that they lie themselves down with a sigh of happiness and not of all that grander than their gratitude
gratitude must fade sooner or late for the cant feel it for ever try as he may
benefits forgot are dust and ashes to the he remembers
but none can take from me the good ive won from others good and none can make that memory dim
tis a fairy story murmured mrs susan
no he said tis a little childs thing they learn at a mothers knees and because i was a man i missed it
tis a riddle a generous child could have guessed in a minute but it took one fool from his adult days into old age afore he did
susans mind moved to her purpose and she knew that never again might fall so timely a moment
she put down her knitting flung a peat on the fire and spoke
you be full of wonderful tales tonight but now ill please ask you to listen to me she began
and mark this you cant well be too hard upon me
ive got a pack of sins to confess and if when youve heard em you wont do with me no more then do without me and send me through that door
i deserve it
theres nought thats bad i dont deserve
he started up
whats this
he said
you havent told anybody
no no no
bant nothing about your affairs
in a word i overheard a secret
i listened
i did it out of womans cursed curiosity
and as if that werent enough i got drunk as a fly down to the white thorn a while back and let out the truth
and noughts too bad for in nature im sure
ned put down his pipe and turned to her
dont get excited
begin at the beginning
what did you hear
i heard mrs cora tell you she was your brothers mistress
i heard her tell you her children was also his
and youre scourged for knowing it
let that be a lesson to you woman
thats only the beginning
i bant scourged for that
im scourged because ive let it out again
im shocked at you he answered
yes im very much shocked at you but im not at all surprised
i knew as sure as i knew anything that out
the lord chooses his own time and his own tool
but that dont make your sin smaller
youre a wicked woman
ive signed the pledge however and not another drop how many of em did you tell
but one
of course i chose the man with the longest tongue
jack saw me up the hill after closing time had to squeak
but i made him swear as solemn as he how that he wouldnt
hes not what he was
we had a proper row a month ago
i doubt if hell ever speak to me again
and until he makes a humble apology for what he spoke i wont hear him
he swore he wouldnt tell
be that as it may it will be known
its started and it wont stop
they talked for two hours upon the problems involved in these facts
then there came a knock at the door and susan went to answer it
ned heard a protracted mumble and finally after some argument mrs susan shut the door and returned into the kitchen with a man
it was jack himself
he explained the reason for his unduly late visit
he was anxious and troubled
he spoke without his usual fluency
i didnt come to see you he said
i till twas past your hour for going to bed
but knowing that mrs susan was always later i thought to speak to her
however nothing would do but i came in and here i be
ill have nought to say to you a single you make a solemn apology for your infernal impudence last time you stood here afore me said the master of surveying his visitor
so susan tells me and so i will then replied jack
so solemn as ever you like
you was right and i was wrong and i did ought to have been kicked from here to beacon and back for what i said to you
wem always punished for losing of our tempers
and i was damn soon punished for losing mine as you shall hear
but first i confess that i was wrong and ax you man to man to forgive me
which i will do and heres my hand on it said the other
the old men shook hands and susan wept
her emotion was audible and humphrey told her to go to bed
she refused
im in this she said
tis all my wicked fault from beginning to end and im going to hear it out
i shall weep my eyes blistered afore morning
dont begin now then
if youre going to stop here be silent said humphrey
she sniffed wiped her face and then fetched a black bottle some drinking water and two glasses
light your pipe and say what you feel called upon to say concluded humphrey to mr_head
tis like this answered the other
every man wants to boss somebody in this world
thats a failing of human nature and if we aint strong enough to lord it over a we try to reign over a hoss or even a dog
something we have to be master of
well long since i marked that and then thanks to my understanding and sense i to i may have read twas greater far to lord it over yourself than any other created thing
and harder far said humphrey
without doubt right
and i set about it and i had myself in hand something wonderful and very proud i felt of it as i had the right to feel
then the lord seeing you puffed up sent a hard stroke to try whether you was as clever as you thought you he found you were not suggested ned
i dont care nothing about that nonsense answered jack and knowing my opinions there aint no call to drag the lord in
all i do know is that my savings went i got my monkey up about it and i got out of hand
yes i got out of hand
the awful shock of losing my pounds odd took me off my balance
for a bit i couldnt stand square against it and i did some vain things and just sank to be a common everyday fool like most other people
tis a good thing you can see it for twill end by righting your opinion of yourself
my opinion of myself was a thought too high
i admit it answered jack
for the moment i was only for the moment
now ive come back to my commonsense and my high ideas i can assure you
but the mischief is that just while i was dancing with rage and out of hand altogether i did some mistaken things
enough i had on my mind to make me do em too
but i wont excuse em
ill say out and out that they were very wrong
youve agreed to overlook one of those things and you say youll forgive me for talking a lot of rubbish against you for which im terrible sorry
so thats all right and no lasting harm there
but jobs worse
jack stopped for breath and susan sighed from the bottom of her immense bosom
humphrey poured out some gin and water for his guest
then he helped himself more sparingly
heres to you said jack
to drink under this roof is to be forgiven
now ill go on with my tale and tell you about the second piece of work
he related how he had left in wrath how he had met with timothy timothy how he had been reproved and how he had hit back both with his fists and his tongue
he knocked me down and gave me the truth of music with his heavy stick
i hit him first and im not saying anything about what he did though there may be thirty years between us but anyway he roused cain in me and i told him in a word that the woman he was going to marry was the natural child of nathan ned
twas a double offence against because id promised susan here not to let it out and because to tell timothy of all men was a cowardly deed against the girl seeing he meant to marry her
but id quarrelled with her already and tell him i did and now i tell you
he drank and stared into the fire
for some time humphrey did not reply but at last he expressed his opinion
it all depends on the sort of chap that timothy may prove to be
hell either believe you or he wont
if he dont no harms done
if he do then tis his character and opinions will decide him
for his own sake well trust hell throw her off for woe the man that marries her but if he loves her better than her hell go his way and care nothing
if he looks at it different and thinks the matter cant rest there hell go further
for my part i cant say i care much about it
all i know is that priscilla cora has rare virtues though she werent virtuous and lived on no bed of roses for all the brave way in which she stands up for my late brother
she wont be sorry the murders out
when she told meor when i told heri made it plain that in my opinion this ought to be known
she stood for the children not herself and said it never must be known for their sakes
well now we shall see who hears it next
as for you two youve got your consciences and it bant for me to come between you and them
well ive told my story and admitted my failings like a man said jack and having done so i can do no more
my conscience is cleared and i defy it to trouble me again and i may add that ill take mighty good care not to give it the chance
so there you are
and come what may i can stand to that
how if they deny it and have you up for libel
asked ned but jack flouted the idea
not them he said
have no fear on that score
ive got this woman for witness and ive got you
for that matter even if twas known nobody wouldnt die of astonishment
since the things mr_gollop mr_gollop said after nathan died come as a very gentle surprise i believe
and when alls said whos the worse except what be called public morals
ned nodded
theres some sense in what you say jack
and im glad were friends again
and now im going to bed so ill ax you to be gone
head rose finished his refreshment and shook neds hand
and im the better for knowing as youve been enough to forgive me he said
and as you can i suppose susan here can
i know im very much in her black books and i deserve that too and id make it up to her in any way i to marry her
that i never will do for any woman as long as i live
no and never will get the chance to replied susan and i only trust to god twill all die out and we hear no more of it
head turned at the door and spoke a final word
it may interest you to know that everybody have had their money but me and thomas coode the drunken farmer at
tis strange i should be put in the same class with coode but so it is
however ive larned my lesson
i shall say no more about that
think of it i must being but mortal but speak i wont
youll do well to forget it answered ned
the man or woman if twas one be probably settled in their mind not to pay you or coode youre so little deserving
jack shrugged his shoulders but kept his recent promise and went out silently
chapter x a jay with flash of azure and rose screaming along from point to point of a coppice hard by and cora saw it
she frowned for this bird was associated in her mind with a recent and an unpleasant incident
her brother heathman whose disparate nature striking against her own produced many explosions had recently told her that the jay was her tuneless
she remembered the occasion of this attack but for the moment had no energy at leisure with which to hate him for difficulties were rampant in her own path and chance began to treat her much as she had treated other people in the past
in a word her lover grew colder
as yet she had no knowledge of the reason but the fact could not be denied and her uneasiness increased
he saw somewhat less of her and he made no effort to determine the time of the wedding
neither did he invite her to do so
he had come twice to see mrs cora when cora was not by and an account of these visits was reported by her mother
i dont exactly know why he dropped in either time said mrs cora
he kept talking on everyday matters and never named your name
twas curious in fact the way he kept it out
all business but nothing about the business of marrying you
yet there was plenty on his mind i do believe
i should reckon as hed come for a special purpose but finding himself here it stuck in his throat
hes strong with men but weak with women
have he told you of aught thats fretting him
her daughter could remember nothing of the sort
neither did she confess what she did timothy was unquestionably cooler than of old
tis time the day was named declared priscilla
and youd better suggest it when next you meet with him
but cora did not do so because there was much in timothys manner that told her he desired no expedition
some time had now elapsed since last she saw him and today she was going in obedience to a note brought by a labourer to meet him at the rut half a mile from farm
that he should have thus invited her to come to him was typical of the change in his sentiments
formerly he would have walked or ridden to her
the tone of his brief note chilled her but she obeyed it and was now approaching their tryst at evening time in early september
in a little field nigh she heard the purr of a machine
it was round and round shearing at each revolution a slice from the island of oats that still stood in the midst of a sea of fallen grain
a boy drove the machine and behind it followed humphrey ned and rupert
the younger man had come over to help garner the crop
together they worked gathered up the oats and set them in little sheaves
the waning sunlight gilded the standing oats
now and then a dog barked and darted round the vanishing island in the midst for from safety by half an acre of rabbits squatted together and for the moment when they must bolt and make their final run to death
cora unseen watched this spectacle then mrs susan appeared with a tray on which were three mugs and a jug of cider
the girl was early for her appointment but she forward presently and marked timothy timothy in the lower part of the valley
it was the ruts hour of late summer for the brightness of the flowers had ceased to shine the scanty heath made little display and autumn had as yet lighted no beacon fire
stunted thorn trees ripened their harvest but the round masses of the greater furze were dim a prevalent and heavy green spread over the rut and the only colour contrast was that presented by long stretches of dead brake fern
the litter had been cut several weeks before and allowed to dry and ripen
it had now taken upon itself a dark colour widely different from the richer more lustrous and splendour of auburn that follows natural death
the dull brown stuff was being raked together ready for the cart and cora from behind a furze clump watched her sweetheart carry immense trusses of the bracken and heave them up to the growing pile upon a wain that for the load
all she could see was a pair of straight legs in black gaiters moving under a little stack of the fern then the litter was lifted to reveal timothy timothy
presently he looked at his watch and marked that the time of meeting was nearly come
whereupon he donned his coat made tidy his handed his fork to a labourer and left the working party
he strolled slowly up the along the way that she must approach while she left her and set out to meet him
he shook hands but he did not kiss her and he did not look into her eyes
instead he evaded her own glance spoke quickly and walked quickly in unconscious obedience to his own mental turmoil
i cant run she said
if you want me to hear what youre saying timothy you must go slower or else sit down in the hedge
its terrible he answered
its terrible and its made an old man of me
but some things you seem to know from the first are true and some you seem to know are not
and when first i heard it i said to myself t tis a damned lie of a wicked and venomous man but then with time and thought and god knows how many sleepless nights i got to see twas true enough
and why wasnt i told
i ask you that
why wasnt i told
her heart sank and her head grew giddy
she translated this speech with lightning intuition and knew too well all that it must mean
it explained his increasing coolness his absences and evasions
it signified that he had changed his mind upon learning the secret of the coras
a natural feminine histrionic instinct made her pretend utmost astonishment though she doubted whether it would deceive him
what youre talking about i havent the slightest idea she said
but if you have a grievance so have more than one
you wasnt used to order me here and there six weeks ago
twas you that would come and see me then now ive got to weary my legs to tramp to do your bidding
he paid no heed to her protest
if you dont understand then you must and before we part too
i cant go on like this
no living man could do it
i called twice to see your mother about it for it seemed to me that twas more i should speak to her than to you but when i faced her i couldnt open my mouth much as i wanted to do so
she shook me almost and id have been thankful to be shook but tis the craft and cunning of the thing thats too much for me
ive been hoodwinked in this and no doubt laughed at behind my back
thats whats made me feel as i do now
i and hoped on and loved you for years and saw you chuck two other men and found id got you at last and reckoned i was well rewarded for all my patience what
this what
are you mad
what didnt you dare to speak to my mother and yet you can speak to me
what have i done thats set you against me
what sin have i committed
dont think im blind
ive seen you cooling off clear enough and for the life of me i couldnt guess the reason try as i would and sorrow about it as i would
but since youve ordered me here for this perhaps youll go straight on and tell me whats all the matter
i want you to answer me one question
the answer you must know and i ask you to swear afore your maker that youll tell me the truth
mind this i know the truth
its scorched into me like a burn this many a day
but i must hear it from you too cora
she guessed his question and also guessed that in truth lay her last hope
he spoke positively and she doubted not that he knew
his fear before her mother was natural
she perceived how easily a man might have gone to a woman with this momentous question on his mind and how naturally the presence of the woman might strike him dumb at the actual meeting
none knew better than cora how different is the reality of a conversation with a from the imaginary interview formulated before the event
there was but one problem in her mind advantage or disadvantage of truth
she judged that the case was desperate but that her only hope lay in honesty
speak she said
and i swear ill answer nought but the i know the truth
he hesitated and considered her answer
he was fond of her still but the circumstance of this deception to which he supposed her a party had gone far to shake his affection
the grievance was that the facts should have been hidden from him after his proposal
he held that then was the time when coras paternity should have been divulged
he believed that had he known it then it would have made small difference to his love
it was not so much the fact as the hiding of the fact that had troubled him
who was your father
he asked at length and the words burst out of him in a heap like an explosion
i know who he was she answered
name him then
you see timothy you never asked
i often thought whether there was any reason to tell you and often and often i felt you ought to know but youre a wise and man and i wasnt the only one to be thought on
id have told you from the first even at the risk of angering you but there was mother
i couldnt do what shed feel
i was a daughter afore i was a sweetheart
would you have done it when you came to think on your mother
name him
nathan ned was my father and my sisters and brothers father
my mother was his wife all but in name and they only didnt marry because it meant losing money
you understand why i didnt tell of my poor mother
now you can do as you please
im myself anyway and im not going to suffer for anothers sins more than i can help
theres no stain on me and well you know it
nathan was your father
he was
i suppose heathman told you
hes threatened to oft enough
no matter for that
tis so and twas deliberately hidden from me
twas hidden from all the world
and why not
i did no wrong by hiding it feel as i might
there was four to think of
hidden from all the world and hidden
i didnt learn it from heathman
youve brought this on yourself in a way
if you hadnt quarrelled with a certain man i shouldnt have done so either
jack told me after id thrashed him for insulting you and i suppose if he hadnt i might have gone to church with you and very likely gone to my grave at last and never known what you was
i should have told you when my mother died
swear that
i tell you it is so
im going to swear no more at your bidding
tis for me to speak now
youve cut me to the quick today and i doubt if i shall ever get over it
a very manly way to treat an innocent girl i should think
however i forgive everything and always shall for i love the ground you walk on and you know it and from any wish to treat you without proper respect that i hid away this cruel thing
i said to myself it cant hurt dear tim not to know it and it would hurt my mother and my sister terribly if twas known
so right or wrong i did what i did and now youre in judgment over me and i canti cant live another moment dear timothy till i know how you feel about it
she had begun in a spirit rather dictatorial but changed swiftly into this milder appeal when she marked the expression of his face
he was prepared to stand little
from the first she felt almost hopeless that she would have power to move him
who told jack
asked timothy
god knows
my brother i should think
theres none else in the world but mother and phyllis that knew it
others were told but not me
i was deceived by all of you
thats not true she answered as her fighting instinct got the better of tact
to deceive you not to tell you
all families have got too
you did wrong to me
even like as if i was nobody
i come of pretty good on my mothers side and i think a lot of such things
well the neds dont be foolish woman
think im
there a case for talk that i can see
the thing be done and cant be undone
id have overlooked it so like as not if youd made a clean breast of the truth when i offered for you but to let me go on cant forgive that
perceiving what had hurt him cora set herself to lessen the sting as much as possible but she failed
they talked to no purpose for an hour while she used every argument that occurred to her and he opposed to her swift mind and subtle reasoning a blank impassive wall of sulky anger and wounded pride
it began to grow dark before the conclusion came and they had walked halfway back to shaugh
at the top of the hill he left her and the battle ended in wrath on both sides and a parting irrevocable
her failure it was that made cora lose her temper and when she did so he thankful for the excuse spoke harshly and absolved his own uneasy spirit for so doing
the final scene was brief and the woman wearied in mind and body with her efforts to propitiate him drew it down upon them
why dont you speak out like a man then
she said at last
why keep growling in your throat like a brute and not answering my questions
tis because you cant answer them in right and justice
but one word youve got to find a tongue to though well you may be shamed to do it
it shant be said ive thrown you over if thats the cowardly thing youre playing up for
i promised to marry you and i would marry you but you dont want to marry me it seems and youve pitched on this paltry thing to get out of it
paltry thing
youre shameless
yes it is paltry and everybody would say so and youll hear what decent people think of you pretty soon if you throw me over i can tell you
how can a child help its own father or see whether its parents be properly married
youre cruel and mad both
well see then he answered
since youre bent on hearing me speak i will
and dont pretend as im growling and youre not hearing
ill tell you what i mean and my words shall be as clear as my mind is about it
i wont marry you now and i wouldnt if you was all you ought to be
ive had a taste of your tongue this evening thats opened my mind a good bit to what you are
youve shown me a lot more about yourself than you think for
and if i did growl like a brute my ears was open and my wits was wide awake like a man
and i wont marry you and ive a perfect right not to do so after this
you dirty coward
no you shant marry me and you shouldnt if you crawled to me across the whole world on your knees and prayed to me to forgive you
and if youre well out of it what am i
and dont you think youve heard the last of this because you have not
ive got good friends and strong friends in the world though youd like to fancy as i was friendless and outcast for men like you to spit on
but i can fight my own battles very well come to that as you shall find and ill have you up for breach gods my judge and if decent men dont bring in proper terrifying damages against you ill ask you to forgive me
yes ill make your name laughed at from one end of the moor to as you shall find afore many days older
he stood still before this threat and finding that he did not answer she left him and hastened home
there she blazed her startling news
coras own attitude towards the truth was now one of indifference
she raged against her fate and for the time being could not look forward
phyllis alone displayed grief
she was engaged to a young baker at and feared for her own romance therefore she wept and revealed the liveliest concern
but heathman perceiving priscillas indifference exhibited the like
it appeared that mother and son were glad rather than regretful at this escape of truth
mrs cora however exhibited exceeding wonder if little dismay
she was sorry for cora but not for herself
i had a feeling strong as death in me that come to light she said
somehow i always knew that the thing must struggle out sometime
many and many actually knew it in their hearts by a sort of a dogs reason
and i knew they knew it
but the truth was never openly thrust in my face till he died and mr_gollop mr_gollop spoke it
and she being what she is none believed her and twas enough that she should whisper scandal for the better sort to flout her and turn a deaf ear
and now its out and the great wonder in me bant that tis out but who let it out
for the moment it looks as if twas a miracle yet no doubt time will clear that too
i suppose youll go now said cora
anyway if you dont i shall
theres been nought but trouble and misery for me in this hole from my childhood upward
chapter xi there visited cadworthy on a sunday afternoon priscilla cora with her son and her younger daughter
they came unexpectedly though rupert had told heathman they would not be unwelcome
may was from home and the business of preparing tea fell upon milly ned
phyllis helped ruperts wife in this operation and while they were absent in the kitchen and the men went to the farm hester and priscilla spoke together
the one discussed her son the other her daughter and herself
ive been coming over to see you this time said mrs ned but what with the weather the things that are being said perhaps
no not them
im an old woman now and if ive not got patience at my age when shall i get it
good things have to than i im only sorry for them as have had less fortune
i never pay no heed to stories at any time
my master taught me that
i merely want to tell you that tis all true
for my childrens sake i should never have told it but since it had to come im right glad
id rather you spared yourself said mrs ned
youve had enough to bear i should reckon
leave it
ive always felt a very great respect for you and always shall do so and ive no wish to hear anything about it
well i know what men are and what life is
he was in you and lucky in his brothers
what he took away from me humphrey has given back
now well go on as before
mr timothy have thrown your maiden over i hear
whats she going to do
thank you for being kind answered mrs cora
ive been a good deal astonished to find how easily the people have took this thing
the worlds a place than i for one had any idea of
the neighbours save here and there seem to be like you and reckon that tis no business of theirs
my sons terrible pleased that it have got out and the young man who is going to marry phyllis dont mean to alter his plans
and your brother is glad also i suppose for he wished it
but to cora this business of being flung over hit her very hard and she wanted to bring an action for breach of promise against timothy
she went to see about it only he didnt seem to think shed get much and advised her to do no such thing
why bant she along with you today
she wont go nowhere
shell be off pretty soon to a milliners to plymouth
she wants to clear away from everything so quick as may be
natural enough
let her go in a shop somewhere and begin again
my ned i may tell you have found work i hope
no
another girl to marry him
it looks as if it might go through this time though i cant see him really married after all his adventures with the maidens
tis the daughter of the keeper at tavistock
and shes the only her fathers the ground she goes on
its like to happen after christmas
and neds been straight about it and broke in a young horse or two very clever for mr king so i suppose hell let them wed for the girls sake
hes there today
mrs cora nodded
wheres may
she asked
away too
only till evening
shes drinking tea along with her uncle humphrey at
a strange man he is
tis strange for any man to be so good
he first found out about me and his brother
and how reckon
from cora
his sharp eyes saw her father in her long before nathan died
ive been to since it came out
he was content that cora had suffered so sharp and said so
he thinks a great deal of you and heathman however
milly brought the tea at this moment and called heathman and rupert who were smoking in the farmyard
they appeared and baby was carried to join the company
rupert showed the cup that his godfather had given to the child
the neds made it clear that they designed no change in their relations with mrs cora
a sharp estrangement had followed neds but that belonged to the past
amity reigned and milly expressed regret at mrs coras determination to leave shaugh in the following spring
theyll both be girls she explained and heathman here havent got no need of a wife yet he says so he and i shall find a smaller and a cheaper place than
cora will marry yet foretold rupert
third times lucky they say
twill be the fourth time corrected milly
they ate and drank and spoke on general subjects then the coras prepared to start and priscilla uttered a final word to hester before the younger people
i thank you for letting the past go
there was but few mattered to me and you were the first of them
they departed and the neds talked about them
behind her back they spoke gently of priscilla and old mrs ned revealed even a measure of imagination in her speech
the worst was surely after he sank into his grave and the storm broke said hester
to think she was standing there his unknown unlawful wife yet a wife in spirit with all a wifes love and all a wifes belief in him
to think that her ear had to hear and her heart had to break and her mouth had to be dumb
gall and vinegar that woman have had for her portion these many she goes
shes got a rare good son to stand by her declared rupert
and so have i murmured milly squeezing the baby who was sucking her breast
and ive got four answered mrs ned
four brave on sea and three on land
things be divided curious but our part is to thank god for what weve got and not worry because them that deserve more have so much less
thats his work and the balance will swing true again in his own good time
elsewhere upon their journey home the coras fell in with may
she was excited and turned back and walked beside them for half a mile
im just bursting with news she said and i hope you havent heard it
the world be full of news answered heathman
theres a bit down to shaugh as i meant to tell rupert just now and forgot owing to press of other matters
it proves as im a prophet too for ive said this three year that it was bound to happen
and that disgrace in the churchyard over my fathers grave have brought it to a climax
i mean tommy mr_gollop and that other old rip
both have got the sack
the reverend dennis have hit out right and left and floored the pair of em
mind you tell rupert that
twill make him die of laughing
the old boys be showing their teeth too i promise you
ill tell him
and what was your news
asked mrs cora
very good yet perhaps no news neither to many folk who understand things better than me
yet id often thought in my mind that twas my uncle humphrey clearing off nathans she stopped brought to silence by the recollection of their relationship
say it said priscilla
i know whats on your lips
dont fear to say it
that twas uncle humphrey made all right continued may
and paid back what had been lost
we cant say how it might have gone if nathan had lived
no doubt sooner or late hed have done the same for never would he let man or woman suffer if he could help it
anyway all be in the fair way to have their money again
and i asked lawyer mr_popham long ago when he came to cadworthy who twas and he wouldnt say but had no doubt we could guess
and then i asked susan and she wouldnt say but yet came so near saying that there was little left to know
and today i tackled uncle humphrey and gave him no peace till twas out
to please himself hes done it
she for breath and then continued and theres more yet
twas him paid up my married sisters legacy and even neds not justice
and when uncle humphrey far be it brother ruperts to have cadworthy
i got that out of him too
but ive solemnly promised not to tell rupert
hes going to tell him himself
a useful old fairy and no mistake laughed heathman
hell beggar himself afore hes finished and then youll all have to set to work to keep him out of the
he said that very thing answered may and susan said the same
not that it makes any difference to him for he hasnt got any comforts round him and gets savage if you ask him so much as to take a hot brick to bed with him to warm himself in winter
all these things said mrs cora have been done for honour of the name
your folk go back along into the past and theres never been a cloud between them and honest dealing
but when father was cut off with his work unfinished it that he left no money and the many things that he had planned all fell short without his mastermind to pick up the threads and bring them through
then came humphrey ned and for love of his brother and for love of the name did these good deeds
and to beggar himself in money be nought in the eyes of that man if he leaves his family rich in credit afore the eyes of the world
such another was your own father may and such another is your brother rupert and such another was your cousin mark
they had their own sight and looked at the world their own way and all saw it different maybe but they never saw justice different
and such be i declared heathman
i cant call myself a ned and shant get no thinner for that but im the son of my mother and shes worth a shipload of any other than the whole flight of you neds though you be
and im very well pleased to be kin to you all if you like and if you dont like you can leave it
they parted then and may returned home
heathman showed himself highly gratified at what he had heard and his sister shared his satisfaction
but their mother was sunk deep in the hidden places of her own heart and they left her alone while they spoke together
chapter xii walked over one evening to talk with his lifelong friend thomas
the gardener felt choked to the throat with injustice and regarded his dismissal from the vicarage as an outrage upon society while laboured under similar emotions
both declared that the ingratitude of dennis dennis was what principally stung them
to retire into private life caused them no pain but to have been invited to do so was a bitter grievance
mr_gollop mr_gollop chanced to be out and thomas sat by the fire alone
his bible stood on the table but he was not reading it
only when knock sounded at the cottage door did thomas wheel round from the fire open the book and appear to be buried in its pages
he had rather expected a visit from mr dennis hence these preparations but when joe_voysey entered thomas modified his devout attitude and shut the bible again
i half thought as that wretched man from the vicarage might call this evening he said
he wont then replied for got together all they fools who have fallen in with his wish about carols at christmas
him and her be down at the schoolroom and theres row enough rising up to fright the moon

i wish the time was come for him to sing to his god for mercy said thomas
then he went to a cupboard and brought out a bottle of spirits
have he said anything to you about a pension
asked joe_voysey
no not yet
i thought he might be coming in about that tonight
my father afore me got a shilling a day for i ought to have twice as much in my opinion though i dont expect it
and when ive got all i can im going to shake the dust off my boots against the man and his church too
never again till im carried in to my grave will i go across the so long as he be there
im going to take up with the dissenters and i advise you to do the same
that woman have told me about my pension answered dennis i mean
i wont call her miss no more for tis too respectful
worked on her she give me three a week
but i doubt she had anything to do with a beastly as her
however thats the money and who think theyve took on
that anointed fool the policemans brother
been learning a lot of silliness down to a nurseryman at plymouth and hem coming here so bold as brass and so noisy as a drum to show what can be done with that garden
and if i dont look over the wall sometimes and have a laugh at him tis pity
mr_gollop nodded but he did not answer
then proceeded with malevolent glee
i clear out on the last day of the year he said and if i havent picked the eyes out of his garden and got em settled in my patch afore that day
she met me taking over a lot of mint plants a bit ago
where be you taking they mint plants
she said
to a neighbour i said
he wants em and we can spare em
youll ask me please before you give things away joe_voysey she said
and now i ax humble as a maggot if i may take this or that to a neighbour afore i move a leaf
and she always says yes if we can spare it
had her
as for me said mr_gollop i shall be the last regular right down parish clerk we ever the good old times come back later
a sexton he must use since people have got to be buried but who twill be i neither know nor care
mind you take the tools said
they be fairly your property and you can sell em again if you dont want em yourself
ive made a good few shillings that way during the last forty years
but as for leaving the church i shouldnt do that because of the christmas boxes
tis well in shaugh that your christmas boxes run into a tidy figure and some people go so far as to say that what you take at the door when the come out after christmas morning prayer is pretty near so good as what be dropped in the bags for the offerings
lies declared thomas
all envious lies
i never got near what the people thought
still i hadnt remembered
thats yet another thing where hell have robbed me
when mr_gollop mr_gollop appeared half an hour later she was cold and dispirited
what be you doing in here
she said to mr joe_voysey
having a tell with thomas
we be both wishing to god we could strike them hateful people to the vicarage
harm be bound to come to em for their unchristian ways but me and your brother would like to be in it
youll be in it alone then she answered for this place have gone daft where theyre concerned
they cant do no wrong to us
the people babble about him and even her as if they was angels that had lost their wings
tis all lax and lawless and going to the dogs said thomas
theres no truth and honesty and manliness left in shaugh
the man found a human thighbone kicking about up under the top hedge of the churchyard yesterday
lord knows where it had come from
i never seed it nowhere but he turned on me and said twas sacrilege and i know not what else
where theres churchyards therell also be bones i said to the fool and if one here and there works to the top along of the natural heaving of the earth how can a sexton or any other man help it
a feeble creature and making the young men feeble too

who wants carols
however ive done with him
ive stood between him and his folly time and again but never no more
let him go
tis a generation declared mr joe_voysey
all for comfort and luxury
tea with sugar in it have took the place of the good honest sour cider like what every man had in harvest days of old
but now these here young youths they say sharp cider turns their innards
it never used to turn ours
tis all of a piece and the nations on the downward road along of too much
for my part i think tis more the weakness of mind than the weakness of body that be ruining us observed mr_gollop
as a nurse i see more than you men can and as a female i hear more than you do
and i will say that the way the people have taken these here doings of that scarlet woman to is a sin and a scandal
at first they wouldnt believe it though i blew the trumpet of truth in their ears from the moment that dissenter died but afterwards when twas known as a fact and the parties couldnt deny it and mr timothy over cora as any respecting man would when he heard the shameful who came to me and said ah you was right mr_gollop and i was wrong
not one of em
and whats worse is the spirit theyve taken it in
nobody cares though everybody ought to care
every person says tis none of their business explained joe_voysey
more shame to em
declared thomas
as if it wasnt the business of all decent men and women
time was when such an terror of a woman would have been stoned out of the village in the name of law and righteousness
yet now mention the thing where i will tis taken with a heathen calmness that makes my blood boil
and dennis worst of all mind
if it wasnt a case for a scorching sermon when was there one
yet not a word
and not a word from the dissenters in the tis a subject very great against most times
however ive inquired and i find it has been passed over
no godly anger anywhere admitted mr_gollop and not one word of sorrow to me for the hard things what were spoken when i stood up singlehanded and told the truth
religion be dying out of the nation summed up thomas
my father always said that me and mr_gollop would live to see antichrist ascend his throne and it begins to look as if the times were very near ripe for the man
and twill be harder than ever im driven out from being parish clerk
for i shall have to look on and yet be powerless to strike a blow
they drank in gloomy silence but mr joe_voysey was not similarly oppressed by the moral breakdown of the times
he strove to bring conversation back to the vicarage and failing to do so soon took his leave
after he had gone the brother and sister debated long and thomas gave it as his opinion that it would be well for them to leave shaugh and end their days in a more christian and congenial atmosphere
theres nought to keep us now he said all have gone down afore that dennis and tis something of a question whether such as we ought to bide here simply as common folk with no more voice in the parish
if we go the blame lies on his shoulders but once i make up my mind i wont though the people come before me and beg on their bended knees for me to do so
be like adam and eve being driven out of the garden if wem forced to go declared mr_gollop
with this difference however that the blame bant with us though the punishment may be
theres nobody can say weve ever done wrong here or gone outside our duty to god or man by a hair
if we go tis them that drive us out will have to pay for their wickedness
theyll certainly smart if tis only in the long run confessed mr_gollop
twill be brought home against them at the appointed time
thomas nodded
cold comfort he said but the only satisfaction there is to be got out of it by us
yes i shall go i shall shake off the dust for a witness
i wish i thought as choke a party here and there but thank god i know my place
i never offered to do his almighty work and i never will
i never wanted to call down thunder from heaven on the
but tis always a tower of faith to a righteous man when he sees the lord strike
and to them as be weak in faith tis often a puzzle and a temptation to see how long the lord holds off when justice cries aloud to him to rise up and do his worst
chapter xiii at the approach of another christmas humphrey ned stood in the churchyard of st edwards and watched two masons lodge the stone that he had raised to his brother nathan
it conformed to the usual pattern of the ned memorials and was of slate
the lettering had been cut deep and plain without addition of any ornament
the accidental severity and simplicity of the stone contrasted to advantage with vivians ornate and tasteless marble beside it
dennis dennis walked across the churchyard presently and seeing humphrey turned and approached
good morning he said
glad youve put a slate here
i like them better than these garish things
they are more suited to this grey moor world of ours
tis a foolish waste to spend money on the dead answered ned
when all the living be clothed and fed then we can fling away our money over graves
tis only done to please ourselves not to please them
youve a right to speak said the clergyman
to praise you would be an but as the priest of him we both worship i rejoice to think of what you have done to clear the clouded memory of this man
humphrey took no verbal notice of these remarks
he shrugged his shoulders and spoke of the gravestone
ill thank you to read what ive put over him and say whether tis not right and just
the other obeyed
after particulars of nathans age and the date of his death there followed only the first verse of the psalm blessed is he that the poor the lord will deliver him in time of trouble
you see explained ned my brother did consider the none else
that he made a botch of it along of bad judgment and too much hope and too much trust in himself is neither here nor there for i hold his point of view was though mistaken
if we see a mans point of view it often wont say to mercy for thats no business of ours in my to the higher justice
to judge by results is worldly sense but im doubtful if tis heavenly sense
anyway thats how i feel about my brother now though twas only brought home to me after a year of thinking and as for the end of the text certainly that happened because none can doubt the lord delivered him in the time of trouble
his death was a deliverance as every death must be but none more than nathans afore the tempest broke
as little as the other what nathans death had brought to nathan of mental agony before the these points freely
they walked together in the churchyard and spoke of moral topics and religious instruction
at a point in the enclosure the younger stopped and indicated a space remote from the lodges of the silent people
you design to lie it not so
mr_gollop i remember told me a long time ago now
the old man regarded the spot indifferently and shook his head
i meant it now
we change our most fixed purposes under the battering of the world and small enough our old thoughts often look when seen again after things have happened and years have passed
ill creep to join my own if you please
they wont mind i reckon if i sink into the pit beside em
ill go by my wife and my son and my brothers
well all rise and brave the trump together as well as erring man may
the stone was set in its place presently and ned well pleased with the result set off homeward
his tethered pony stood at the gate and he mounted and went slowly up the hill
chapter xiv some say they believe the old saying and some say they dont declared mr abraham elford to a thin bar at six oclock on christmas eve but for my part i know what ive proved to be true with my own eyes and i will stick to it that apples picked at wane of moon do shrivel and up cruel
in fact for hoarding they be no use at all
and you swear that youve proved that
asked mr_head in his most judicial manner
you stand there a man up home sixty years of age and steadfastly declare that apples gathered when the moon be on the wane do dry up quicker than others that be plucked when it begins to grow
yes i do declared the innkeeper
dont i tell you that ive proved it
pick your apples when the moon be first horning thats my advice
they upon the question and missed its real interest as an example of the value of evidence and the influence of superstition and individual idiosyncrasy on all human testimony
jack scoffed abraham elford grew warm for who is there that can endure to hear his depositions brushed aside as worthless
upon this great topic of the shrinking of apples at wane of moon some sided with mr_head while others who held lunar influence as a force reaching into dark mysteries of matter and mind supported the publican
the contention was brisk and not until it began to interfere with the nightly sale of his liquor did elford awake to its danger and stop it
he conceded nothing but declared the argument must cease
tis christman eve said he and no occasion for any short words or sharp sayings
me and head both know that wem right and mountains wouldnt move either of us from our opinions so let it be
he lifted a great earthen pot from the fire in the bar parlour
it contained cider with pieces of toast floating in it
pretty drinking as im certain sure that one and all of you will say foretold the host
apples however rose again to be first topic of conversation before this fine wassail and jack spoke once more
time was down to the in country that on this else old christman eve i forget should all have marched out solemn to the orchards and sung lucky songs and poured out cider and fired our guns into the branches and made allround heathen fools of ourselves
and why
because twas thought that to do so improved the next years crop a
and when we remember that twas no further back than our fathers that they did such witless things it did ought to make us feel humble im sure
dont talk no more about cider drink it said heathman cora who was of the company
drink it while tis hot and twill warm your bones and soften your opinions
so peart tonight and so sharp at the corners that i reckon youve got your money back at last
this direct attack reduced mr_head to a less energetic and dogmatic frame of mind
no he answered
i have not and i happen to know that i never shall
me and the old chap fell out and i dressed him down too sharp
i was wrong and ive since admitted it for im the rare fearless sort that grant im wrong the first minute it can be proved against me
though when a mans built on that large pattern you may be sure he bant wrong very often
tis only the peddling small creatures that wont admit theyre of a natural fear that if they once allow it theyll never be thought right again
but though hes forgiven me ive strained the friendship
so we live and learn
had his money again said the host of the white thorn
he drunken dog
theres only me left returned jack
it wasnt till after he lost his money that he took to swilling however declared the innkeeper
i know him well
the misfortune ruined his character
his daughters been paid back all the same said cora
she keeps his hawk_house and the old boy gave the money to her to be used or saved according as she thinks best
that leaves only me said jack
me and rupert was running over the figures a bit ago continued heathman
we made out that the sporting old blade had dropped upwards of six thousand over this job and we was wondering how much that is out of all hes got
a i reckon answered head but the other doubted it
rupert says he thinks tis pretty near half of his fortune if not more
he goes than ever and he eats little better than for his food
thats no new thing said another man as he held a mug for some more of the hot cider twas always so as susan will tell you
my wife have heard her grumbling off and on these ten years about it
his foods poor and coarse like his and his cider
his clothes be kept on his back till there bant enough of the web left to hold em together any longer
susan offered an old coat to a tramp once thinking to get it away afore ned missed it and the tramp looked it and through you might he thanked susan as saucy as you please and told her that when he was going to set up for a hed let her know but be yet
1 scarecrow
a strange old nighthawk and always have been said head
not a even me though i know him measure him altogether
never was such a mixture
now hes so as the best stone and youll go gaily driving into him and then suddenly youll strike flint and get a spark in your eye and wish to god youd left the man alone
hes beyond any mind to understand as ive told him more than once
meek as moses one minute then all claws and prickles the they tell me declared abraham elford
but whether tis true or not i cant say from experience he added for the man dont come in here
and why
said heathman
thats another queer side of him
i axed him that same question and he said because to his eyes the place was haunted by my father
i should see nathans long beard wagging behind the bar he said to me and i couldnt abide it
hes above common men no doubt declared another speaker
we can only leave him at that
hes a riddle none here will ever guess and thats the last word about him
rupert ned came in at this moment and saw heathman
both were in dennis denniss carol choir and it was time that they gathered with the rest at the vicarage for a long round of singing them
a mild night and the roads pretty passable he announced
were away in half an hour wi books and lanterns but no be coming with us like in the good old days
only voices to carry it off
he stopped to drink and the sight of jack reminded him of a commission
i want you jack he said
come out in the for half a moment
they departed together and in a few moments returned
rupert was laughing mr_head exhibited the liveliest excitement
in one hand he waved three notes with the other he some gold and silver
money
money
money souls
he shouted
if that old hero havent paid me after all
give it a name boys drinks round
they congratulated him and liquor flowed
head was full of rejoicing
he even exhibited gratitude
you might say twas no more than justice he began but i tell you hes more than a very generous old man and nobody can deny it and i for one would like to do something to pay him back
theres nought you can do declared elford but be about it and overlook the little smart that always touches a big mind when its asked to accept favours
not a big mind corrected rupert
tis only a small mind cant take favours
and the thought of giving that smart would pain my uncle for hes terrible tender and hes all his life and knows what tis to feel so
smart be damned
said mr_head
theres no smart about getting back your own
im only glad that he felt the call to pay and though i was kept to the last i shant quarrel about that
if rupert here as be his nephew and his right hand by all accounts could hit on a thing for us to do that would please the man then i say us might do it without loss of credit
theres nobody has anything serious against him i believe nowadays unless it be abraham here because he never comes inside his bar
the publican shrugged his shoulders
i cant quarrel for that he said since he nowhere else either
they considered the possible ways of bringing any satisfaction to humphrey ned but could hit on no happy project
head indeed was fertile of ideas but rupert found objections to all of them
if us could only do something that meant a lot of different chaps all of one mind said heathman
the old bird always thinks that the people hate him or laugh at him and if we could somehow work a trick that showed a score of folk all meaning well to him and thinking well of him for once but lord knows what
then came an interruption in the shape of dennis dennis
he was warm and somewhat annoyed
he turned upon the guilty rupert and heathman
this is too bad you fellows
he said
here were all waiting and waiting and despite my express wishes you turn in to drink
i blame you both
they expressed the liveliest regret and dennis was speedily mollified when he heard the great argument that had made these men forget the business of the night
theres no time now he answered but youre in the right to think of such a thing and after christmas i shall be only too glad to lend a hand
a very admirable idea and im glad youve hit on it
just a of my wassail your honour for luck said the host and dennis protesting took the glass handed to him
a sudden and violent explosion from mr_head made the clergyman nearly choke in the middle of his drinking
ive got it
cried jack so loudly that the company started
he slapped his leg at the same moment and then danced with exaggerated rejoicing
got what
dts
asked heathman
go up along to
i beg and pray your reverence to go there first of all urged jack
surely tis the very thing
tis just what we was trying to light that meant the showing of general that meant a bit of trouble and thought taken for your blessed christmas put and all the rest of it
if you was to steal up through the garden by the greenside and then burst forth like one there tis
who can deny tis a noble idea
and you can go and holler to the quality afterwards
good for you jack
answered rupert
and i say ditto with all my heart if mr dennis come then interrupted dennis
the night will be gone before we start
well go to right away
i cant such a wish though its a mile out of the beat we had planned
come
the clergyman with rupert ned and heathman cora hurried off and a few of the younger men accompanied by jack followed after them
i must just pop in my hawk_house and lock up this dollop of money said jack then go up over with the singers to see how the old hawk takes it
hell be scared first and then hell try to look as if he was going to fling out of the windows or set the dogs at us and all the time we shall very well know that hes bubbling over with surprise to find what a number of respectable people have got to thinking well of him
the crowd of men and boys moved on ahead of jack and his friends
the shrill cries and laughter of the youngsters and a bass rumble of adult voices night and a dozen lanterns flashed among the company as they ascended into the silent darkness of dartmoor
chapter xv humphrey ned had hoped that his nephew might visit him on christmas eve but he learned that it was impossible because rupert had joined the and would be occupied with them on a wide circle of song
after dark he sat alone until near seven oclock then mrs susan returned home and they took their supper together
the meal ended she cleared it away and settled to her knitting
talk passed between them not unmarked by sentiment for it concerned the past and related to those changes the year had brought
on the following day humphrey was to eat his christmas dinner at cadworthy and susan hoped to spend the festival with friends in shaugh
ive got heathman and his mother to be of the company said ned
the daughters are both about their own business and one goes to her sweetheart and coras down to plymouth so we shall escape from them and no harm done
but heathman and his mother will be there
they are rather a puzzle to me susan
no doubt she replied
youll go on puzzling yourself over this party or that till youve puzzled yourself into the
havent you paid all the creditors to the last penny
not so he answered
thats where it lies
a mans children and their mother are his first creditors i should reckon
theyve got first call in justice if not in law
i judge that theres a fine bit of duty there and the way they look at much my own way me feel i wrote to that bad cora yesterday
shes working hard im told
susan sniffed
so does the devil she said
tis all very well for you i suppose because when you wake up some morning and discover as youve got nought left in the world but your youll go about to them youve befriended to seek for your own lucky youll be if you find it or half of it but what of me
youll never want he declared
youre the sort always to fall on your feet
sos young cora for that matter
no need to worry about him
hes a lesson if you like
the man to be contented whatever haps
i know it
ive marked it
ive learnt no little from him
a big heart and a mighty power of taking life as it comes without fuss
theres a bad side to it however as well as a good
ive worked that out
its good for a man to be contented but no good for the place he lives in
contented people never stir up things or throw light into dark corners or let air into stuffy places
content means stagnation so oft as not
they mind their own business however
they mostly do and thats selfish wisdom so oft as not
now jacks never content and never will be
dont name that man on christmas eve
said mrs susan
i hate to think of him any day of the week for that matter
yet him and the east wind both be useful little as you like em
for my part ive been a neighbour to the east wind all my life and shared its quality in the eyes of most now
but the wind of god be turning out of the east for me susan
so long as you be pleased with yourself and as for content a tis an accident like red hair or bow legs
you cant get it nor yet get away from it by taking thought
he nodded
youre in the right there
one man will make more noise if he scratches his finger than another if he breaks his leg
tis part of the build of the mind and dont depend on chance
same with a matter of character not condition i know men that wont be wretched while they can draw their breath and some wont be happy though theyve got thrice their share of good fortune
no doubt thats how providence levels up and gives the one what he cant enjoy to balance him with the other whos got nought but whos also got the blessed power of making happiness out of nought
youve found the middle way i suppose she said and like others who think theyre on the sure road to happiness you be pushing along too fast
running myself out of
but youre wrong
im too cautious for that
if im a miser as the people still think here and there then tis for peace im a miser
twas always peace of mind that i and for yet went in doubt if such a thing there was
and even now though i seem along the road to it i feel a cold fear often enough whether my way will stand all weathers
it may break down yet
not while your money lasts she answered with a short laugh
he followed his own thoughts in silence and then spoke aloud again
restless as the fox and than ever he was
every mans hand against me as i thought and mine held out to every man but they wouldnt see it
none to come to my hearth willingly though twas always hot for em none to look into my meaning though that meaning was always meant for kindness
but who shall blame any living creature that they thought me an enemy and not a friend
how should they know
didnt i hide the scant good that was in me more careful than the bird her nest
they be up to your tricks now anyway and ive helped to show em better though you may not believe it declared susan
what a female could do ive done for you and i always shall say so
i know that he said
theres no good thing on earth than cant be made better but one thing
and thats the thing in all christian minds this mean the thing called love
you know deal in it
out of your kind soul youve always felt friendly to me and you saw what i had the wish but not the power to show to others and youve done your share of the work to make the people like me better
maybe tis mostly your doing if we could but read into the truth of it
this world must for ever fall far short of the humblest ethical ideal and doubtless even those who fell prostrate at the shout of their thunder spirit or worshipped the sun and the sea in the morning of days guessed dimly how their kind lacked much of perfection
to them the brooding soul of humanity revealed the road though little knew those early men the length of it little they understood that the goal of any faultless standard must remain a shifting ideal within reach of mind alone
at certain points ned darkly suspected weak places in this new armour of light
while his days had indeed achieved a consummation and orbicular completeness beyond all hope while looking backward he could not fail to contrast gloom with sunset light the fierce equinox of autumn with this unfolding period of a gracious indian summer now following upon it yet even here there fell a narrow shadow of cloud there a wind not
in deep and secret thought he had drifted upon that negation of justice involved by the golden rule
he saw what every intellect worthy a name must see that to do as you would be done by to withhold the scourge from the guilty shoulder to suffer the weed to flourish in the garden to shield our from the consequence of their evil or folly is to put the individual higher than society and to follow a precept that ethics in evolution has long rejected
but he his dilemma he believed it not necessary to pursue the paradox to its bitter end
the golden rule he into a living and an omnipresent creed henceforth it was destined to be his criterion of every action and to his doubting spirit he replied that if not practicable in youth if not convenient for middle age this principle might most justly direct the performance and stimulate the thought of the old
thus he was and knew himself untrue to the clearer colder conviction of his reasoning past but in practice this defection brought a peace so exalted a content so steady a recognition so precious that he rested his spirit upon it in faith and sought no further
now he retraced his time and made a brief and pregnant summary thereof for susans ear
tis to be spoken in a score of words he said
my life has been a storm in a teacup but none the less a terrible storm for me until i won the grace to still it
port to the be a blessed thing according to the voyage thats gone afore
the worse that the better the peace of the haven when he comes to it
she was going to speak but a sound on the stillness of night stopped her
hark
was all she said
together they rose and went to his outer door
the moon sailed through a sky of thin cloud and light fell dimly upon the open spaces but sparkled in the great darkness of evergreen things about the garden
earth rolled to the southern hills and its breast was touched with sparks of flame where those few habitations visible from this place
a lattice of naked boughs meshed the moonlight under the slope of the hill and from beneath their shadows ascended a moving thread of men and boys
they broke the stillness with speech and laughter and their red struck to right and left and killed the wan moonshine as they came
whats toward now
asked ned staring before him
why cried susan tis the without a doubt
theyll want an ocean of beer presently and where shall us get it from
coming to to sing to me
he mumbled
good god a thing far beyond my utmost thought is this
the crowd rolled clattering up and the woman stayed to welcome them but the man ran back into his hawk_house sat down in his chair bent forward to listen and clasped his hands tightly between his knees
acute emotion marked his countenance but this painful tension passed when out of the night there rolled the melodious thunder of an ancient tune
singing for me
he murmured many times while the old song
