estella s name
is it havisham or
i had nothing to add
or what
said he
is it havisham
it is havisham
this brought us to the dinner table where she and sarah pocket awaited us
mr jaggers presided estella sat opposite to him i faced my green and yellow friend
we dined very well and were waited on by a maid servant whom i had never seen in all my comings and goings but who for anything i know had been in that mysterious house the whole time
after dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my guardian he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage and the two ladies left us
anything to equal the determined reticence of mr jaggers under that roof i never saw elsewhere even in him
he kept his very looks to himself and scarcely directed his eyes to estella s face once during dinner
when she spoke to him he listened and in due course answered but never looked at her that i could see
on the other hand she often looked at him with interest and curiosity if not distrust but his face never showed the least consciousness
throughout dinner he took a dry delight in making sarah pocket greener and yellower by often referring in conversation with me to my expectations but here again he showed no consciousness and even made it appear that he extorted and even did extort though i don t know how those references out of my innocent self
and when he and i were left alone together he sat with an air upon him of general lying by in consequence of information he possessed that really was too much for me
he cross examined his very wine when he had nothing else in hand
he held it between himself and the candle tasted the port rolled it in his mouth swallowed it looked at his glass again smelt the port tried it drank it filled again and cross examined the glass again until i was as nervous as if i had known the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage
three or four times i feebly thought i would start conversation but whenever he saw me going to ask him anything he looked at me with his glass in his hand and rolling his wine about in his mouth as if requesting me to take notice that it was of no use for he couldn t answer
i think miss pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in the danger of being goaded to madness and perhaps tearing off her cap which was a very hideous one in the nature of a muslin mop and strewing the ground with her hair which assuredly had never grown on her head
she did not appear when we afterwards went up to miss havisham s room and we four played at whist
in the interval miss havisham in a fantastic way had put some of the most beautiful jewels from her dressing table into estella s hair and about her bosom and arms and i saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick eyebrows and raise them a little when her loveliness was before him with those rich flushes of glitter and color in it
of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody and came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands before which the glory of our kings and queens was utterly abased i say nothing nor of the feeling that i had respecting his looking upon us personally in the light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long ago
what i suffered from was the incompatibility between his cold presence and my feelings towards estella
it was not that i knew i could never bear to speak to him about her that i knew i could never bear to hear him creak his boots at her that i knew i could never bear to see him wash his hands of her it was that my admiration should be within a foot or two of him it was that my feelings should be in the same place with him that was the agonizing circumstance
we played until nine o clock and then it was arranged that when estella came to london i should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her at the coach and then i took leave of her and touched her and left her
my guardian lay at the boar in the next room to mine
far into the night miss havisham s words love her love her love her
sounded in my ears
i adapted them for my own repetition and said to my pillow i love her i love her i love her
hundreds of times
then a burst of gratitude came upon me that she should be destined for me once the blacksmith s boy
then i thought if she were as i feared by no means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet when would she begin to be interested in me
when should i awaken the heart within her that was mute and sleeping now
ah me
i thought those were high and great emotions
but i never thought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from joe because i knew she would be contemptuous of him
it was but a day gone and joe had brought the tears into my eyes they had soon dried god forgive me
soon dried
chapter xxx after well considering the matter while i was dressing at the blue boar in the morning i resolved to tell my guardian that i doubted orlick s being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at miss havisham s
why of course he is not the right sort of man pip said my guardian comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head because the man who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man
it seemed quite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was not exceptionally held by the right sort of man and he listened in a satisfied manner while i told him what knowledge i had of orlick
very good pip he observed when i had concluded i ll go round presently and pay our friend off
rather alarmed by this summary action i was for a little delay and even hinted that our friend himself might be difficult to deal with
oh no he won t said my guardian making his pocket handkerchief point with perfect confidence i should like to see him argue the question with me
as we were going back together to london by the midday coach and as i breakfasted under such terrors of pumblechook that i could scarcely hold my cup this gave me an opportunity of saying that i wanted a walk and that i would go on along the london road while mr jaggers was occupied if he would let the coachman know that i would get into my place when overtaken
i was thus enabled to fly from the blue boar immediately after breakfast
by then making a loop of about a couple of miles into the open country at the back of pumblechook s premises i got round into the high street again a little beyond that pitfall and felt myself in comparative security
it was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more and it was not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after
one or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went a little way down the street before me that they might turn as if they had forgotten something and pass me face to face on which occasions i don t know whether they or i made the worse pretence they of not doing it or i of not seeing it
still my position was a distinguished one and i was not at all dissatisfied with it until fate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant trabb s boy
casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress i beheld trabb s boy approaching lashing himself with an empty blue bag
deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best beseem me and would be most likely to quell his evil mind i advanced with that expression of countenance and was rather congratulating myself on my success when suddenly the knees of trabb s boy smote together his hair uprose his cap fell off he trembled violently in every limb staggered out into the road and crying to the populace hold me
i m so frightened
feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and contrition occasioned by the dignity of my appearance
as i passed him his teeth loudly chattered in his head and with every mark of extreme humiliation he prostrated himself in the dust
this was a hard thing to bear but this was nothing
i had not advanced another two hundred yards when to my inexpressible terror amazement and indignation i again beheld trabb s boy approaching
he was coming round a narrow corner
his blue bag was slung over his shoulder honest industry beamed in his eyes a determination to proceed to trabb s with cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait
with a shock he became aware of me and was severely visited as before but this time his motion was rotatory and he staggered round and round me with knees more afflicted and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy
his sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators and i felt utterly confounded
i had not got as much further down the street as the post office when i again beheld trabb s boy shooting round by a back way
this time he was entirely changed
he wore the blue bag in the manner of my great coat and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of the street attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he from time to time exclaimed with a wave of his hand don t know yah
words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon me by trabb s boy when passing abreast of me he pulled up his shirt collar twined his side hair stuck an arm akimbo and smirked extravagantly by wriggling his elbows and body and drawling to his attendants don t know yah don t know yah pon my soul don t know yah
the disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when i was a blacksmith culminated the disgrace with which i left the town and was so to speak ejected by it into the open country
but unless i had taken the life of trabb s boy on that occasion i really do not even now see what i could have done save endure
to have struggled with him in the street or to have exacted any lower recompense from him than his heart s best blood would have been futile and degrading
moreover he was a boy whom no man could hurt an invulnerable and dodging serpent who when chased into a corner flew out again between his captor s legs scornfully yelping
i wrote however to mr trabb by next day s post to say that mr pip must decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed to the best interests of society as to employ a boy who excited loathing in every respectable mind
the coach with mr jaggers inside came up in due time and i took my box seat again and arrived in london safe but not sound for my heart was gone
as soon as i arrived i sent a penitential codfish and barrel of oysters to joe as reparation for not having gone myself and then went on to barnard s inn
i found herbert dining on cold meat and delighted to welcome me back
having despatched the avenger to the coffee house for an addition to the dinner i felt that i must open my breast that very evening to my friend and chum
as confidence was out of the question with the avenger in the hall which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to the keyhole i sent him to the play
a better proof of the severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded than the degrading shifts to which i was constantly driven to find him employment
so mean is extremity that i sometimes sent him to hyde park corner to see what o clock it was
dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender i said to herbert my dear herbert i have something very particular to tell you
my dear handel he returned i shall esteem and respect your confidence
it concerns myself herbert said i and one other person
herbert crossed his feet looked at the fire with his head on one side and having looked at it in vain for some time looked at me because i didn t go on
herbert said i laying my hand upon his knee i love i adore estella
instead of being transfixed herbert replied in an easy matter of course way exactly
well
well herbert
is that all you say
well
what next i mean
said herbert
of course i know that
how do you know it
said i
how do i know it handel
why from you
i never told you
told me
you have never told me when you have got your hair cut but i have had senses to perceive it
you have always adored her ever since i have known you
you brought your adoration and your portmanteau here together
told me
why you have always told me all day long
when you told me your own story you told me plainly that you began adoring her the first time you saw her when you were very young indeed
very well then said i to whom this was a new and not unwelcome light i have never left off adoring her
and she has come back a most beautiful and most elegant creature
and i saw her yesterday
and if i adored her before i now doubly adore her
lucky for you then handel said herbert that you are picked out for her and allotted to her
without encroaching on forbidden ground we may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of that fact
have you any idea yet of estella s views on the adoration question
i shook my head gloomily
oh
she is thousands of miles away from me said i
patience my dear handel time enough time enough
but you have something more to say
i am ashamed to say it i returned and yet it s no worse to say it than to think it
you call me a lucky fellow
of course i am
i was a blacksmith s boy but yesterday i am what shall i say i am to day
say a good fellow if you want a phrase returned herbert smiling and clapping his hand on the back of mine a good fellow with impetuosity and hesitation boldness and diffidence action and dreaming curiously mixed in him
i stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture in my character
on the whole i by no means recognized the analysis but thought it not worth disputing
when i ask what i am to call myself to day herbert i went on i suggest what i have in my thoughts
you say i am lucky
i know i have done nothing to raise myself in life and that fortune alone has raised me that is being very lucky
and yet when i think of estella and when don t you you know
herbert threw in with his eyes on the fire which i thought kind and sympathetic of him
then my dear herbert i cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain i feel and how exposed to hundreds of chances
avoiding forbidden ground as you did just now i may still say that on the constancy of one person naming no person all my expectations depend
and at the best how indefinite and unsatisfactory only to know so vaguely what they are
in saying this i relieved my mind of what had always been there more or less though no doubt most since yesterday
now handel herbert replied in his gay hopeful way it seems to me that in the despondency of the tender passion we are looking into our gift horse s mouth with a magnifying glass
likewise it seems to me that concentrating our attention on the examination we altogether overlook one of the best points of the animal
didn t you tell me that your guardian mr jaggers told you in the beginning that you were not endowed with expectations only
and even if he had not told you so though that is a very large if i grant could you believe that of all men in london mr jaggers is the man to hold his present relations towards you unless he were sure of his ground
i said i could not deny that this was a strong point
i said it people often do so in such cases like a rather reluctant concession to truth and justice as if i wanted to deny it
i should think it was a strong point said herbert and i should think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger as to the rest you must bide your guardian s time and he must bide his client s time
you ll be one and twenty before you know where you are and then perhaps you ll get some further enlightenment
at all events you ll be nearer getting it for it must come at last
what a hopeful disposition you have
said i gratefully admiring his cheery ways
i ought to have said herbert for i have not much else
i must acknowledge by the by that the good sense of what i have just said is not my own but my father s
the only remark i ever heard him make on your story was the final one the thing is settled and done or mr jaggers would not be in it
and now before i say anything more about my father or my father s son and repay confidence with confidence i want to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a moment positively repulsive
you won t succeed said i
o yes i shall
said he
one two three and now i am in for it
handel my good fellow though he spoke in this light tone he was very much in earnest i have been thinking since we have been talking with our feet on this fender that estella surely cannot be a condition of your inheritance if she was never referred to by your guardian
am i right in so understanding what you have told me as that he never referred to her directly or indirectly in any way
never even hinted for instance that your patron might have views as to your marriage ultimately
never
now handel i am quite free from the flavor of sour grapes upon my soul and honor
not being bound to her can you not detach yourself from her i told you i should be disagreeable
i turned my head aside for with a rush and a sweep like the old marsh winds coming up from the sea a feeling like that which had subdued me on the morning when i left the forge when the mists were solemnly rising and when i laid my hand upon the village finger post smote upon my heart again
there was silence between us for a little while
yes but my dear handel herbert went on as if we had been talking instead of silent its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic renders it very serious
think of her bringing up and think of miss havisham
think of what she is herself now i am repulsive and you abominate me
this may lead to miserable things
i know it herbert said i with my head still turned away but i can t help it
you can t detach yourself
no
impossible
you can t try handel
no
impossible
well
said herbert getting up with a lively shake as if he had been asleep and stirring the fire now i ll endeavor to make myself agreeable again
so he went round the room and shook the curtains out put the chairs in their places tidied the books and so forth that were lying about looked into the hall peeped into the letter box shut the door and came back to his chair by the fire where he sat down nursing his left leg in both arms
i was going to say a word or two handel concerning my father and my father s son
i am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father s son to remark that my father s establishment is not particularly brilliant in its housekeeping
there is always plenty herbert said i to say something encouraging
o yes
and so the dustman says i believe with the strongest approval and so does the marine store shop in the back street
gravely handel for the subject is grave enough you know how it is as well as i do
i suppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up but if ever there was the time is gone
may i ask you if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking down in your part of the country that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are always most particularly anxious to be married
this was such a singular question that i asked him in return is it so
i don t know said herbert that s what i want to know
because it is decidedly the case with us
my poor sister charlotte who was next me and died before she was fourteen was a striking example
little jane is the same
in her desire to be matrimonially established you might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual contemplation of domestic bliss
little alick in a frock has already made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at kew
and indeed i think we are all engaged except the baby
then you are
said i
i am said herbert but it s a secret
i assured him of my keeping the secret and begged to be favored with further particulars
he had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my weakness that i wanted to know something about his strength
may i ask the name
i said
name of clara said herbert
live in london
yes perhaps i ought to mention said herbert who had become curiously crestfallen and meek since we entered on the interesting theme that she is rather below my mother s nonsensical family notions
her father had to do with the victualling of passenger ships
i think he was a species of purser
what is he now
said i
he s an invalid now replied herbert
living on
on the first floor said herbert
which was not at all what i meant for i had intended my question to apply to his means
i have never seen him for he has always kept his room overhead since i have known clara
but i have heard him constantly
he makes tremendous rows roars and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument
in looking at me and then laughing heartily herbert for the time recovered his usual lively manner
don t you expect to see him
said i
o yes i constantly expect to see him returned herbert because i never hear him without expecting him to come tumbling through the ceiling
but i don t know how long the rafters may hold
when he had once more laughed heartily he became meek again and told me that the moment he began to realize capital it was his intention to marry this young lady
he added as a self evident proposition engendering low spirits but you can t marry you know while you re looking about you
as we contemplated the fire and as i thought what a difficult vision to realize this same capital sometimes was i put my hands in my pockets
a folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention i opened it and found it to be the play bill i had received from joe relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of roscian renown
and bless my heart i involuntarily added aloud it s to night
this changed the subject in an instant and made us hurriedly resolve to go to the play
so when i had pledged myself to comfort and abet herbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable means and when herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me by reputation and that i should be presented to her and when we had warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence we blew out our candles made up our fire locked our door and issued forth in quest of mr wopsle and denmark
chapter xxxi on our arrival in denmark we found the king and queen of that country elevated in two arm chairs on a kitchen table holding a court
the whole of the danish nobility were in attendance consisting of a noble boy in the wash leather boots of a gigantic ancestor a venerable peer with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life and the danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white silk legs and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance
my gifted townsman stood gloomily apart with folded arms and i could have wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable
several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded
the late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled with a cough at the time of his decease but to have taken it with him to the tomb and to have brought it back
the royal phantom also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon to which it had the appearance of occasionally referring and that too with an air of anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state of mortality
it was this i conceive which led to the shade s being advised by the gallery to turn over
a recommendation which it took extremely ill
it was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit that whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time and walked an immense distance it perceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall
this occasioned its terrors to be received derisively
the queen of denmark a very buxom lady though no doubt historically brazen was considered by the public to have too much brass about her her chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of that metal as if she had a gorgeous toothache her waist being encircled by another and each of her arms by another so that she was openly mentioned as the kettle drum
the noble boy in the ancestral boots was inconsistent representing himself as it were in one breath as an able seaman a strolling actor a grave digger a clergyman and a person of the utmost importance at a court fencing match on the authority of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were judged
this gradually led to a want of toleration for him and even on his being detected in holy orders and declining to perform the funeral service to the general indignation taking the form of nuts
lastly ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness that when in course of time she had taken off her white muslin scarf folded it up and buried it a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the front row of the gallery growled now the baby s put to bed let s have supper
which to say the least of it was out of keeping
upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with playful effect
whenever that undecided prince had to ask a question or state a doubt the public helped him out with it
as for example on the question whether twas nobler in the mind to suffer some roared yes and some no and some inclining to both opinions said toss up for it and quite a debating society arose
when he asked what should such fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven he was encouraged with loud cries of hear hear
when he appeared with his stocking disordered its disorder expressed according to usage by one very neat fold in the top which i suppose to be always got up with a flat iron a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his leg and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him
on his taking the recorders very like a little black flute that had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the door he was called upon unanimously for rule britannia
when he recommended the player not to saw the air thus the sulky man said and don t you do it neither you re a deal worse than him
and i grieve to add that peals of laughter greeted mr wopsle on every one of these occasions
but his greatest trials were in the churchyard which had the appearance of a primeval forest with a kind of small ecclesiastical wash house on one side and a turnpike gate on the other
mr wopsle in a comprehensive black cloak being descried entering at the turnpike the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way look out
here s the undertaker a coming to see how you re a getting on with your work
i believe it is well known in a constitutional country that mr wopsle could not possibly have returned the skull after moralizing over it without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the comment wai ter
the arrival of the body for interment in an empty black box with the lid tumbling open was the signal for a general joy which was much enhanced by the discovery among the bearers of an individual obnoxious to identification
the joy attended mr wopsle through his struggle with laertes on the brink of the orchestra and the grave and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the kitchen table and had died by inches from the ankles upward
we had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud mr wopsle but they were too hopeless to be persisted in
therefore we had sat feeling keenly for him but laughing nevertheless from ear to ear
i laughed in spite of myself all the time the whole thing was so droll and yet i had a latent impression that there was something decidedly fine in mr wopsle s elocution not for old associations sake i am afraid but because it was very slow very dreary very uphill and downhill and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything
when the tragedy was over and he had been called for and hooted i said to herbert let us go at once or perhaps we shall meet him
we made all the haste we could downstairs but we were not quick enough either
standing at the door was a jewish man with an unnatural heavy smear of eyebrow who caught my eyes as we advanced and said when we came up with him mr pip and friend
identity of mr pip and friend confessed
mr waldengarver said the man would be glad to have the honor
waldengarver
i repeated when herbert murmured in my ear probably wopsle
oh
said i
yes
shall we follow you
a few steps please
when we were in a side alley he turned and asked how did you think he looked i dressed him
i don t know what he had looked like except a funeral with the addition of a large danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue ribbon that had given him the appearance of being insured in some extraordinary fire office
but i said he had looked very nice
when he come to the grave said our conductor he showed his cloak beautiful
but judging from the wing it looked to me that when he see the ghost in the queen s apartment he might have made more of his stockings
i modestly assented and we all fell through a little dirty swing door into a sort of hot packing case immediately behind it
here mr wopsle was divesting himself of his danish garments and here there was just room for us to look at him over one another s shoulders by keeping the packing case door or lid wide open
gentlemen said mr wopsle i am proud to see you
i hope mr pip you will excuse my sending round
i had the happiness to know you in former times and the drama has ever had a claim which has ever been acknowledged on the noble and the affluent
meanwhile mr waldengarver in a frightful perspiration was trying to get himself out of his princely sables
skin the stockings off mr waldengarver said the owner of that property or you ll bust em
bust em and you ll bust five and thirty shillings
shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair
keep quiet in your chair now and leave em to me
with that he went upon his knees and began to flay his victim who on the first stocking coming off would certainly have fallen over backward with his chair but for there being no room to fall anyhow
i had been afraid until then to say a word about the play
but then mr waldengarver looked up at us complacently and said gentlemen how did it seem to you to go in front
herbert said from behind at the same time poking me capitally
so i said capitally
how did you like my reading of the character gentlemen
said mr waldengarver almost if not quite with patronage
herbert said from behind again poking me massive and concrete
so i said boldly as if i had originated it and must beg to insist upon it massive and concrete
i am glad to have your approbation gentlemen said mr waldengarver with an air of dignity in spite of his being ground against the wall at the time and holding on by the seat of the chair
but i ll tell you one thing mr waldengarver said the man who was on his knees in which you re out in your reading
now mind
i don t care who says contrairy i tell you so
you re out in your reading of hamlet when you get your legs in profile
the last hamlet as i dressed made the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal till i got him to put a large red wafer on each of his shins and then at that rehearsal which was the last i went in front sir to the back of the pit and whenever his reading brought him into profile i called out i don t see no wafers
and at night his reading was lovely
mr waldengarver smiled at me as much as to say a faithful dependent i overlook his folly and then said aloud my view is a little classic and thoughtful for them here but they will improve they will improve
herbert and i said together o no doubt they would improve
did you observe gentlemen said mr waldengarver that there was a man in the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the service i mean the representation
we basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man
i added he was drunk no doubt
o dear no sir said mr wopsle not drunk
his employer would see to that sir
his employer would not allow him to be drunk
you know his employer
said i mr wopsle shut his eyes and opened them again performing both ceremonies very slowly
you must have observed gentlemen said he an ignorant and a blatant ass with a rasping throat and a countenance expressive of low malignity who went through i will not say sustained the rôle if i may use a french expression of claudius king of denmark
that is his employer gentlemen
such is the profession
without distinctly knowing whether i should have been more sorry for mr wopsle if he had been in despair i was so sorry for him as it was that i took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces put on which jostled us out at the doorway to ask herbert what he thought of having him home to supper
herbert said he thought it would be kind to do so therefore i invited him and he went to barnard s with us wrapped up to the eyes and we did our best for him and he sat until two o clock in the morning reviewing his success and developing his plans
i forget in detail what they were but i have a general recollection that he was to begin with reviving the drama and to end with crushing it inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft and without a chance or hope
miserably i went to bed after all and miserably thought of estella and miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled and that i had to give my hand in marriage to herbert s clara or play hamlet to miss havisham s ghost before twenty thousand people without knowing twenty words of it
chapter xxxii one day when i was busy with my books and mr pocket i received a note by the post the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter for though i had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed i divined whose hand it was
it had no set beginning as dear mr pip or dear pip or dear sir or dear anything but ran thus i am to come to london the day after to morrow by the midday coach
i believe it was settled you should meet me
at all events miss havisham has that impression and i write in obedience to it
she sends you her regard
yours estella
if there had been time i should probably have ordered several suits of clothes for this occasion but as there was not i was fain to be content with those i had
my appetite vanished instantly and i knew no peace or rest until the day arrived
not that its arrival brought me either for then i was worse than ever and began haunting the coach office in wood street cheapside before the coach had left the blue boar in our town
for all that i knew this perfectly well i still felt as if it were not safe to let the coach office be out of my sight longer than five minutes at a time and in this condition of unreason i had performed the first half hour of a watch of four or five hours when wemmick ran against me
halloa mr pip said he how do you do
i should hardly have thought this was your beat
i explained that i was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by coach and i inquired after the castle and the aged
both flourishing thankye said wemmick and particularly the aged
he s in wonderful feather
he ll be eighty two next birthday
i have a notion of firing eighty two times if the neighborhood shouldn t complain and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure
however this is not london talk
where do you think i am going to
to the office
said i for he was tending in that direction
next thing to it returned wemmick i am going to newgate
we are in a banker s parcel case just at present and i have been down the road taking a squint at the scene of action and thereupon must have a word or two with our client
did your client commit the robbery
i asked
bless your soul and body no answered wemmick very drily
but he is accused of it
so might you or i be
either of us might be accused of it you know
only neither of us is i remarked
yah
said wemmick touching me on the breast with his forefinger you re a deep one mr pip
would you like to have a look at newgate
have you time to spare
i had so much time to spare that the proposal came as a relief notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my eye on the coach office
muttering that i would make the inquiry whether i had time to walk with him i went into the office and ascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his temper the earliest moment at which the coach could be expected which i knew beforehand quite as well as he
i then rejoined mr wemmick and affecting to consult my watch and to be surprised by the information i had received accepted his offer
we were at newgate in a few minutes and we passed through the lodge where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison rules into the interior of the jail
at that time jails were much neglected and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all public wrongdoing and which is always its heaviest and longest punishment was still far off
so felons were not lodged and fed better than soldiers to say nothing of paupers and seldom set fire to their prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup
it was visiting time when wemmick took me in and a potman was going his rounds with beer and the prisoners behind bars in yards were buying beer and talking to friends and a frowzy ugly disorderly depressing scene it was
it struck me that wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener might walk among his plants
this was first put into my head by his seeing a shoot that had come up in the night and saying what captain tom
are you there
ah indeed
and also is that black bill behind the cistern
why i didn t look for you these two months how do you find yourself
equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to anxious whisperers always singly wemmick with his post office in an immovable state looked at them while in conference as if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made since last observed towards coming out in full blow at their trial
he was highly popular and i found that he took the familiar department of mr jaggers s business though something of the state of mr jaggers hung about him too forbidding approach beyond certain limits
his personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both hands and then tightening the post office and putting his hands in his pockets
in one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the raising of fees and then mr wemmick backing as far as possible from the insufficient money produced said it s no use my boy
i m only a subordinate
i can t take it
don t go on in that way with a subordinate
if you are unable to make up your quantum my boy you had better address yourself to a principal there are plenty of principals in the profession you know and what is not worth the while of one may be worth the while of another that s my recommendation to you speaking as a subordinate
don t try on useless measures
why should you
now who s next
thus we walked through wemmick s greenhouse until he turned to me and said notice the man i shall shake hands with
i should have done so without the preparation as he had shaken hands with no one yet
almost as soon as he had spoken a portly upright man whom i can see now as i write in a well worn olive colored frock coat with a peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion and eyes that went wandering about when he tried to fix them came up to a corner of the bars and put his hand to his hat which had a greasy and fatty surface like cold broth with a half serious and half jocose military salute
colonel to you
said wemmick how are you colonel
all right mr
wemmick
everything was done that could be done but the evidence was too strong for us colonel
yes it was too strong sir but i don t care
no no said wemmick coolly you don t care
then turning to me served his majesty this man
was a soldier in the line and bought his discharge
i said indeed
and the man s eyes looked at me and then looked over my head and then looked all round me and then he drew his hand across his lips and laughed
i think i shall be out of this on monday sir he said to wemmick
perhaps returned my friend but there s no knowing
i am glad to have the chance of bidding you good bye mr wemmick said the man stretching out his hand between two bars
thankye said wemmick shaking hands with him
same to you colonel
if what i had upon me when taken had been real mr wemmick said the man unwilling to let his hand go i should have asked the favor of your wearing another ring in acknowledgment of your attentions
i ll accept the will for the deed said wemmick
by the by you were quite a pigeon fancier
the man looked up at the sky
i am told you had a remarkable breed of tumblers
could you commission any friend of yours to bring me a pair if you ve no further use for em
it shall be done sir
all right said wemmick they shall be taken care of
good afternoon colonel
good bye
they shook hands again and as we walked away wemmick said to me a coiner a very good workman
the recorder s report is made to day and he is sure to be executed on monday
still you see as far as it goes a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same
with that he looked back and nodded at this dead plant and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of the yard as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its place
as we came out of the prison through the lodge i found that the great importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys no less than by those whom they held in charge
well mr wemmick said the turnkey who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other what s mr jaggers going to do with that water side murder
is he going to make it manslaughter or what s he going to make of it
why don t you ask him
returned wemmick
o yes i dare say
said the turnkey
now that s the way with them here mr pip remarked wemmick turning to me with his post office elongated
they don t mind what they ask of me the subordinate but you ll never catch em asking any questions of my principal
is this young gentleman one of the prentices or articled ones of your office
asked the turnkey with a grin at mr wemmick s humor
there he goes again you see
cried wemmick i told you so
asks another question of the subordinate before his first is dry
well supposing mr pip is one of them
why then said the turnkey grinning again he knows what mr jaggers is
yah
cried wemmick suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way you re dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my principal you know you are
let us out you old fox or i ll get him to bring an action against you for false imprisonment
the turnkey laughed and gave us good day and stood laughing at us over the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street
mind you mr pip said wemmick gravely in my ear as he took my arm to be more confidential i don t know that mr jaggers does a better thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high
he s always so high
his constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities
that colonel durst no more take leave of him than that turnkey durst ask him his intentions respecting a case
then between his height and them he slips in his subordinate don t you see and so he has em soul and body
i was very much impressed and not for the first time by my guardian s subtlety
to confess the truth i very heartily wished and not for the first time that i had had some other guardian of minor abilities
mr wemmick and i parted at the office in little britain where suppliants for mr jaggers s notice were lingering about as usual and i returned to my watch in the street of the coach office with some three hours on hand
i consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it was that i should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime that in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening i should have first encountered it that it should have reappeared on two occasions starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone that it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement
while my mind was thus engaged i thought of the beautiful young estella proud and refined coming towards me and i thought with absolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her
i wished that wemmick had not met me or that i had not yielded to him and gone with him so that of all days in the year on this day i might not have had newgate in my breath and on my clothes
i beat the prison dust off my feet as i sauntered to and fro and i shook it out of my dress and i exhaled its air from my lungs
so contaminated did i feel remembering who was coming that the coach came quickly after all and i was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of mr wemmick s conservatory when i saw her face at the coach window and her hand waving to me
what was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed
chapter xxxiii in her furred travelling dress estella seemed more delicately beautiful than she had ever seemed yet even in my eyes
her manner was more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before and i thought i saw miss havisham s influence in the change
we stood in the inn yard while she pointed out her luggage to me and when it was all collected i remembered having forgotten everything but herself in the meanwhile that i knew nothing of her destination
i am going to richmond she told me
our lesson is that there are two richmonds one in surrey and one in yorkshire and that mine is the surrey richmond
the distance is ten miles
i am to have a carriage and you are to take me
this is my purse and you are to pay my charges out of it
o you must take the purse
we have no choice you and i but to obey our instructions
we are not free to follow our own devices you and i
as she looked at me in giving me the purse i hoped there was an inner meaning in her words
she said them slightingly but not with displeasure
a carriage will have to be sent for estella
will you rest here a little
yes i am to rest here a little and i am to drink some tea and you are to take care of me the while
she drew her arm through mine as if it must be done and i requested a waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen such a thing in his life to show us a private sitting room
upon that he pulled out a napkin as if it were a magic clew without which he couldn t find the way upstairs and led us to the black hole of the establishment fitted up with a diminishing mirror quite a superfluous article considering the hole s proportions an anchovy sauce cruet and somebody s pattens
on my objecting to this retreat he took us into another room with a dinner table for thirty and in the grate a scorched leaf of a copy book under a bushel of coal dust
having looked at this extinct conflagration and shaken his head he took my order which proving to be merely some tea for the lady sent him out of the room in a very low state of mind
i was and i am sensible that the air of this chamber in its strong combination of stable with soup stock might have led one to infer that the coaching department was not doing well and that the enterprising proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department
yet the room was all in all to me estella being in it
i thought that with her i could have been happy there for life
i was not at all happy there at the time observe and i knew it well
where are you going to at richmond
i asked estella
i am going to live said she at a great expense with a lady there who has the power or says she has of taking me about and introducing me and showing people to me and showing me to people
i suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration
yes i suppose so
she answered so carelessly that i said you speak of yourself as if you were some one else
where did you learn how i speak of others
come come said estella smiling delightfully you must not expect me to go to school to you i must talk in my own way
how do you thrive with mr
pocket
i live quite pleasantly there at least it appeared to me that i was losing a chance
at least
repeated estella
as pleasantly as i could anywhere away from you
you silly boy said estella quite composedly how can you talk such nonsense
your friend mr matthew i believe is superior to the rest of his family
very superior indeed
he is nobody s enemy don t add but his own interposed estella for i hate that class of man
but he really is disinterested and above small jealousy and spite i have heard
i am sure i have every reason to say so
you have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people said estella nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once grave and rallying for they beset miss havisham with reports and insinuations to your disadvantage
they watch you misrepresent you write letters about you anonymous sometimes and you are the torment and the occupation of their lives
you can scarcely realize to yourself the hatred those people feel for you
they do me no harm i hope
instead of answering estella burst out laughing
this was very singular to me and i looked at her in considerable perplexity
when she left off and she had not laughed languidly but with real enjoyment i said in my diffident way with her i hope i may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any harm
no no you may be sure of that said estella
you may be certain that i laugh because they fail
o those people with miss havisham and the tortures they undergo
she laughed again and even now when she had told me why her laughter was very singular to me for i could not doubt its being genuine and yet it seemed too much for the occasion
i thought there must really be something more here than i knew she saw the thought in my mind and answered it
it is not easy for even you
said estella to know what satisfaction it gives me to see those people thwarted or what an enjoyable sense of the ridiculous i have when they are made ridiculous
for you were not brought up in that strange house from a mere baby
i was
you had not your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you suppressed and defenceless under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that is soft and soothing
i had
you did not gradually open your round childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a woman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up in the night
i did
it was no laughing matter with estella now nor was she summoning these remembrances from any shallow place
i would not have been the cause of that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap
two things i can tell you said estella
first notwithstanding the proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone you may set your mind at rest that these people never will never would in hundred years impair your ground with miss havisham in any particular great or small
second i am beholden to you as the cause of their being so busy and so mean in vain and there is my hand upon it
as she gave it to me playfully for her darker mood had been but momentary i held it and put it to my lips
you ridiculous boy said estella will you never take warning
or do you kiss my hand in the same spirit in which i once let you kiss my cheek
what spirit was that
said i
i must think a moment
a spirit of contempt for the fawners and plotters
if i say yes may i kiss the cheek again
you should have asked before you touched the hand
but yes if you like
i leaned down and her calm face was like a statue s
now said estella gliding away the instant i touched her cheek you are to take care that i have some tea and you are to take me to richmond
her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us and we were mere puppets gave me pain but everything in our intercourse did give me pain
whatever her tone with me happened to be i could put no trust in it and build no hope on it and yet i went on against trust and against hope
why repeat it a thousand times
so it always was
i rang for the tea and the waiter reappearing with his magic clew brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment but of tea not a glimpse
a teaboard cups and saucers plates knives and forks including carvers spoons various saltcellars a meek little muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of parsley a pale loaf with a powdered head two proof impressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread and ultimately a fat family urn which the waiter staggered in with expressing in his countenance burden and suffering
after a prolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment he at length came back with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs
these i steeped in hot water and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of i don t know what for estella
the bill paid and the waiter remembered and the ostler not forgotten and the chambermaid taken into consideration in a word the whole house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity and estella s purse much lightened we got into our post coach and drove away
turning into cheapside and rattling up newgate street we were soon under the walls of which i was so ashamed
what place is that
estella asked me
i made a foolish pretence of not at first recognizing it and then told her
as she looked at it and drew in her head again murmuring wretches
i would not have confessed to my visit for any consideration
mr jaggers said i by way of putting it neatly on somebody else has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place than any man in london
he is more in the secrets of every place i think said estella in a low voice
you have been accustomed to see him often i suppose
i have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals ever since i can remember
but i know him no better now than i did before i could speak plainly
what is your own experience of him
do you advance with him
once habituated to his distrustful manner said i i have done very well
are you intimate
i have dined with him at his private house
i fancy said estella shrinking that must be a curious place
it is a curious place
i should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with her but i should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe the dinner in gerrard street if we had not then come into a sudden glare of gas
it seemed while it lasted to be all alight and alive with that inexplicable feeling i had had before and when we were out of it i was as much dazed for a few moments as if i had been in lightning
so we fell into other talk and it was principally about the way by which we were travelling and about what parts of london lay on this side of it and what on that
the great city was almost new to her she told me for she had never left miss havisham s neighborhood until she had gone to france and she had merely passed through london then in going and returning
i asked her if my guardian had any charge of her while she remained here
to that she emphatically said god forbid
and no more
it was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me that she made herself winning and would have won me even if the task had needed pains
yet this made me none the happier for even if she had not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others i should have felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do it and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to crush it and throw it away
when we passed through hammersmith i showed her where mr matthew pocket lived and said it was no great way from richmond and that i hoped i should see her sometimes
o yes you are to see me you are to come when you think proper you are to be mentioned to the family indeed you are already mentioned
i inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of
no there are only two mother and daughter
the mother is a lady of some station though not averse to increasing her income
i wonder miss havisham could part with you again so soon
it is a part of miss havisham s plans for me pip said estella with a sigh as if she were tired i am to write to her constantly and see her regularly and report how i go on i and the jewels for they are nearly all mine now
it was the first time she had ever called me by my name
of course she did so purposely and knew that i should treasure it up
we came to richmond all too soon and our destination there was a house by the green a staid old house where hoops and powder and patches embroidered coats rolled stockings ruffles and swords had had their court days many a time
some ancient trees before the house were still cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and stiff skirts but their own allotted places in the great procession of the dead were not far off and they would soon drop into them and go the silent way of the rest
a bell with an old voice which i dare say in its time had often said to the house here is the green farthingale here is the diamond hilted sword here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire sounded gravely in the moonlight and two cherry colored maids came fluttering out to receive estella
the doorway soon absorbed her boxes and she gave me her hand and a smile and said good night and was absorbed likewise
and still i stood looking at the house thinking how happy i should be if i lived there with her and knowing that i never was happy with her but always miserable
i got into the carriage to be taken back to hammersmith and i got in with a bad heart ache and i got out with a worse heart ache
at our own door i found little jane pocket coming home from a little party escorted by her little lover and i envied her little lover in spite of his being subject to flopson
mr pocket was out lecturing for he was a most delightful lecturer on domestic economy and his treatises on the management of children and servants were considered the very best text books on those themes
but mrs pocket was at home and was in a little difficulty on account of the baby s having been accommodated with a needle case to keep him quiet during the unaccountable absence with a relative in the foot guards of millers
and more needles were missing than it could be regarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply externally or to take as a tonic
mr pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical advice and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a highly judicious mind i had some notion in my heart ache of begging him to accept my confidence
but happening to look up at mrs pocket as she sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing bed as a sovereign remedy for baby i thought well no i wouldn t
chapter xxxiv as i had grown accustomed to my expectations i had insensibly begun to notice their effect upon myself and those around me
their influence on my own character i disguised from my recognition as much as possible but i knew very well that it was not all good
i lived in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to joe
my conscience was not by any means comfortable about biddy
when i woke up in the night like camilla i used to think with a weariness on my spirits that i should have been happier and better if i had never seen miss havisham s face and had risen to manhood content to be partners with joe in the honest old forge
many a time of an evening when i sat alone looking at the fire i thought after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home
yet estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of mind that i really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part in its production
that is to say supposing i had had no expectations and yet had had estella to think of i could not make out to my satisfaction that i should have done much better
now concerning the influence of my position on others i was in no such difficulty and so i perceived though dimly enough perhaps that it was not beneficial to anybody and above all that it was not beneficial to herbert
my lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not afford corrupted the simplicity of his life and disturbed his peace with anxieties and regrets
i was not at all remorseful for having unwittingly set those other branches of the pocket family to the poor arts they practised because such littlenesses were their natural bent and would have been evoked by anybody else if i had left them slumbering
but herbert s was a very different case and it often caused me a twinge to think that i had done him evil service in crowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work and placing the canary breasted avenger at his disposal
so now as an infallible way of making little ease great ease i began to contract a quantity of debt
i could hardly begin but herbert must begin too so he soon followed
at startop s suggestion we put ourselves down for election into a club called the finches of the grove the object of which institution i have never divined if it were not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight to quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner and to cause six waiters to get drunk on the stairs
i know that these gratifying social ends were so invariably accomplished that herbert and i understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the society which ran gentlemen may the present promotion of good feeling ever reign predominant among the finches of the grove
the finches spent their money foolishly the hotel we dined at was in covent garden and the first finch i saw when i had the honor of joining the grove was bentley drummle at that time floundering about town in a cab of his own and doing a great deal of damage to the posts at the street corners
occasionally he shot himself out of his equipage headforemost over the apron and i saw him on one occasion deliver himself at the door of the grove in this unintentional way like coals
but here i anticipate a little for i was not a finch and could not be according to the sacred laws of the society until i came of age
in my confidence in my own resources i would willingly have taken herbert s expenses on myself but herbert was proud and i could make no such proposal to him
so he got into difficulties in every direction and continued to look about him
when we gradually fell into keeping late hours and late company i noticed that he looked about him with a desponding eye at breakfast time that he began to look about him more hopefully about mid day that he drooped when he came into dinner that he seemed to descry capital in the distance rather clearly after dinner that he all but realized capital towards midnight and that at about two o clock in the morning he became so deeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to america with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune
i was usually at hammersmith about half the week and when i was at hammersmith i haunted richmond whereof separately by and by
herbert would often come to hammersmith when i was there and i think at those seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that the opening he was looking for had not appeared yet
but in the general tumbling up of the family his tumbling out in life somewhere was a thing to transact itself somehow
in the meantime mr pocket grew grayer and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the hair
while mrs pocket tripped up the family with her footstool read her book of dignities lost her pocket handkerchief told us about her grandpapa and taught the young idea how to shoot by shooting it into bed whenever it attracted her notice
as i am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing my way before me i can scarcely do so better than by at once completing the description of our usual manners and customs at barnard s inn
we spent as much money as we could and got as little for it as people could make up their minds to give us
we were always more or less miserable and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition
there was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying ourselves and a skeleton truth that we never did
to the best of my belief our case was in the last aspect a rather common one
every morning with an air ever new herbert went into the city to look about him
i often paid him a visit in the dark back room in which he consorted with an ink jar a hat peg a coal box a string box an almanac a desk and stool and a ruler and i do not remember that i ever saw him do anything else but look about him
if we all did what we undertake to do as faithfully as herbert did we might live in a republic of the virtues
he had nothing else to do poor fellow except at a certain hour of every afternoon to go to lloyd s in observance of a ceremony of seeing his principal i think
he never did anything else in connection with lloyd s that i could find out except come back again
when he felt his case unusually serious and that he positively must find an opening he would go on change at a busy time and walk in and out in a kind of gloomy country dance figure among the assembled magnates
for says herbert to me coming home to dinner on one of those special occasions i find the truth to be handel that an opening won t come to one but one must go to it so i have been
if we had been less attached to one another i think we must have hated one another regularly every morning
i detested the chambers beyond expression at that period of repentance and could not endure the sight of the avenger s livery which had a more expensive and a less remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the four and twenty hours
as we got more and more into debt breakfast became a hollower and hollower form and being on one occasion at breakfast time threatened by letter with legal proceedings not unwholly unconnected as my local paper might put it with jewelery i went so far as to seize the avenger by his blue collar and shake him off his feet so that he was actually in the air like a booted cupid for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll
at certain times meaning at uncertain times for they depended on our humor i would say to herbert as if it were a remarkable discovery my dear herbert we are getting on badly
my dear handel herbert would say to me in all sincerity if you will believe me those very words were on my lips by a strange coincidence
then herbert i would respond let us look into our affairs
we always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for this purpose
i always thought this was business this was the way to confront the thing this was the way to take the foe by the throat
and i know herbert thought so too
we ordered something rather special for dinner with a bottle of something similarly out of the common way in order that our minds might be fortified for the occasion and we might come well up to the mark
dinner over we produced a bundle of pens a copious supply of ink and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper
for there was something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery
i would then take a sheet of paper and write across the top of it in a neat hand the heading memorandum of pip s debts with barnard s inn and the date very carefully added
herbert would also take a sheet of paper and write across it with similar formalities memorandum of herbert s debts
each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side which had been thrown into drawers worn into holes in pockets half burnt in lighting candles stuck for weeks into the looking glass and otherwise damaged
the sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly insomuch that i sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money
in point of meritorious character the two things seemed about equal
when we had written a little while i would ask herbert how he got on
herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful manner at the sight of his accumulating figures
they are mounting up handel herbert would say upon my life they are mounting up
be firm herbert i would retort plying my own pen with great assiduity
look the thing in the face
look into your affairs
stare them out of countenance
so i would handel only they are staring me out of countenance
however my determined manner would have its effect and herbert would fall to work again
after a time he would give up once more on the plea that he had not got cobbs s bill or lobbs s or nobbs s as the case might be
then herbert estimate estimate it in round numbers and put it down
what a fellow of resource you are
my friend would reply with admiration
really your business powers are very remarkable
i thought so too
i established with myself on these occasions the reputation of a first rate man of business prompt decisive energetic clear cool headed
when i had got all my responsibilities down upon my list i compared each with the bill and ticked it off
my self approval when i ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation
when i had no more ticks to make i folded all my bills up uniformly docketed each on the back and tied the whole into a symmetrical bundle
then i did the same for herbert who modestly said he had not my administrative genius and felt that i had brought his affairs into a focus for him
my business habits had one other bright feature which i called leaving a margin
for example supposing herbert s debts to be one hundred and sixty four pounds four and twopence i would say leave a margin and put them down at two hundred
or supposing my own to be four times as much i would leave a margin and put them down at seven hundred
i had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same margin but i am bound to acknowledge that on looking back i deem it to have been an expensive device
for we always ran into new debt immediately to the full extent of the margin and sometimes in the sense of freedom and solvency it imparted got pretty far on into another margin
but there was a calm a rest a virtuous hush consequent on these examinations of our affairs that gave me for the time an admirable opinion of myself
soothed by my exertions my method and herbert s compliments i would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the table before me among the stationary and feel like a bank of some sort rather than a private individual
we shut our outer door on these solemn occasions in order that we might not be interrupted
i had fallen into my serene state one evening when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door and fall on the ground
it s for you handel said herbert going out and coming back with it and i hope there is nothing the matter
this was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border
the letter was signed trabb co and its contents were simply that i was an honored sir and that they begged to inform me that mrs j gargery had departed this life on monday last at twenty minutes past six in the evening and that my attendance was requested at the interment on monday next at three o clock in the afternoon
chapter xxxv it was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life and the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful
the figure of my sister in her chair by the kitchen fire haunted me night and day
that the place could possibly be without her was something my mind seemed unable to compass and whereas she had seldom or never been in my thoughts of late i had now the strangest ideas that she was coming towards me in the street or that she would presently knock at the door
in my rooms too with which she had never been at all associated there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure as if she were still alive and had been often there
whatever my fortunes might have been i could scarcely have recalled my sister with much tenderness
but i suppose there is a shock of regret which may exist without much tenderness
under its influence and perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling i was seized with a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had suffered so much and i felt that on sufficient proof i could have revengefully pursued orlick or any one else to the last extremity
having written to joe to offer him consolation and to assure him that i would come to the funeral i passed the intermediate days in the curious state of mind i have glanced at
i went down early in the morning and alighted at the blue boar in good time to walk over to the forge
it was fine summer weather again and as i walked along the times when i was a little helpless creature and my sister did not spare me vividly returned
but they returned with a gentle tone upon them that softened even the edge of tickler
for now the very breath of the beans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be softened as they thought of me
at last i came within sight of the house and saw that trabb and co had put in a funereal execution and taken possession
two dismally absurd persons each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black bandage as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort to anybody were posted at the front door and in one of them i recognized a postboy discharged from the boar for turning a young couple into a sawpit on their bridal morning in consequence of intoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck with both arms
all the children of the village and most of the women were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house and forge and as i came up one of the two warders the postboy knocked at the door implying that i was far too much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself
another sable warder a carpenter who had once eaten two geese for a wager opened the door and showed me into the best parlor
here mr trabb had taken unto himself the best table and had got all the leaves up and was holding a kind of black bazaar with the aid of a quantity of black pins
at the moment of my arrival he had just finished putting somebody s hat into black long clothes like an african baby so he held out his hand for mine
but i misled by the action and confused by the occasion shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection
poor dear joe entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow under his chin was seated apart at the upper end of the room where as chief mourner he had evidently been stationed by trabb
when i bent down and said to him dear joe how are you
he said pip old chap you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a and clasped my hand and said no more
biddy looking very neat and modest in her black dress went quietly here and there and was very helpful
when i had spoken to biddy as i thought it not a time for talking i went and sat down near joe and there began to wonder in what part of the house it she my sister was
the air of the parlor being faint with the smell of sweet cake i looked about for the table of refreshments it was scarcely visible until one had got accustomed to the gloom but there was a cut up plum cake upon it and there were cut up oranges and sandwiches and biscuits and two decanters that i knew very well as ornaments but had never seen used in all my life one full of port and one of sherry
standing at this table i became conscious of the servile pumblechook in a black cloak and several yards of hatband who was alternately stuffing himself and making obsequious movements to catch my attention
the moment he succeeded he came over to me breathing sherry and crumbs and said in a subdued voice may i dear sir
and did
i then descried mr and mrs hubble the last named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner
we were all going to follow and were all in course of being tied up separately by trabb into ridiculous bundles
which i meantersay pip joe whispered me as we were being what mr trabb called formed in the parlor two and two and it was dreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance which i meantersay sir as i would in preference have carried her to the church myself along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts and arms but it were considered wot the neighbors would look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect
pocket handkerchiefs out all
cried mr trabb at this point in a depressed business like voice
pocket handkerchiefs out
we are ready
so we all put our pocket handkerchiefs to our faces as if our noses were bleeding and filed out two and two joe and i biddy and pumblechook mr and mrs hubble
the remains of my poor sister had been brought round by the kitchen door and it being a point of undertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a horrible black velvet housing with a white border the whole looked like a blind monster with twelve human legs shuffling and blundering along under the guidance of two keepers the postboy and his comrade
the neighborhood however highly approved of these arrangements and we were much admired as we went through the village the more youthful and vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage
at such times the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our emergence round some corner of expectancy here they come
here they are
and we were all but cheered
in this progress i was much annoyed by the abject pumblechook who being behind me persisted all the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband and smoothing my cloak
my thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of mr and mrs hubble who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession
and now the range of marshes lay clear before us with the sails of the ships on the river growing out of it and we went into the churchyard close to the graves of my unknown parents philip pirrip late of this parish and also georgiana wife of the above
and there my sister was laid quietly in the earth while the larks sang high above it and the light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees
of the conduct of the worldly minded pumblechook while this was doing i desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me and that even when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought nothing into the world and can take nothing out and how it fleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay i heard him cough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into large property
when we got back he had the hardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known i had done her so much honor and to hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the price of her death
after that he drank all the rest of the sherry and mr hubble drank the port and the two talked which i have since observed to be customary in such cases as if they were of quite another race from the deceased and were notoriously immortal
finally he went away with mr and mrs hubble to make an evening of it i felt sure and to tell the jolly bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest benefactor
when they were all gone and when trabb and his men but not his boy i looked for him had crammed their mummery into bags and were gone too the house felt wholesomer
soon afterwards biddy joe and i had a cold dinner together but we dined in the best parlor not in the old kitchen and joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not that there was great restraint upon us
but after dinner when i made him take his pipe and when i had loitered with him about the forge and when we sat down together on the great block of stone outside it we got on better
i noticed that after the funeral joe changed his clothes so far as to make a compromise between his sunday dress and working dress in which the dear fellow looked natural and like the man he was
he was very much pleased by my asking if i might sleep in my own little room and i was pleased too for i felt that i had done rather a great thing in making the request
when the shadows of evening were closing in i took an opportunity of getting into the garden with biddy for a little talk
biddy said i i think you might have written to me about these sad matters
do you mr
pip
said biddy
i should have written if i had thought that
don t suppose that i mean to be unkind biddy when i say i consider that you ought to have thought that
do you mr
pip
she was so quiet and had such an orderly good and pretty way with her that i did not like the thought of making her cry again
after looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me i gave up that point
i suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now biddy dear
oh
i can t do so mr pip said biddy in a tone of regret but still of quiet conviction
i have been speaking to mrs hubble and i am going to her to morrow
i hope we shall be able to take some care of mr gargery together until he settles down
how are you going to live biddy
if you want any mo how am i going to live
repeated biddy striking in with a momentary flush upon her face
i ll tell you mr pip
i am going to try to get the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here
i can be well recommended by all the neighbors and i hope i can be industrious and patient and teach myself while i teach others
you know mr pip pursued biddy with a smile as she raised her eyes to my face the new schools are not like the old but i learnt a good deal from you after that time and have had time since then to improve
i think you would always improve biddy under any circumstances
ah
except in my bad side of human nature murmured biddy
it was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud
well
i thought i would give up that point too
so i walked a little further with biddy looking silently at her downcast eyes
i have not heard the particulars of my sister s death biddy
they are very slight poor thing
she had been in one of her bad states though they had got better of late rather than worse for four days when she came out of it in the evening just at tea time and said quite plainly joe
as she had never said any word for a long while i ran and fetched in mr gargery from the forge
she made signs to me that she wanted him to sit down close to her and wanted me to put her arms round his neck
so i put them round his neck and she laid her head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied
and so she presently said joe again and once pardon and once pip
and so she never lifted her head up any more and it was just an hour later when we laid it down on her own bed because we found she was gone
biddy cried the darkening garden and the lane and the stars that were coming out were blurred in my own sight
nothing was ever discovered biddy
nothing
do you know what is become of orlick
i should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the quarries
of course you have seen him then why are you looking at that dark tree in the lane
i saw him there on the night she died
that was not the last time either biddy
no i have seen him there since we have been walking here it is of no use said biddy laying her hand upon my arm as i was for running out you know i would not deceive you he was not there a minute and he is gone
it revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by this fellow and i felt inveterate against him
i told her so and told her that i would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of that country
by degrees she led me into more temperate talk and she told me how joe loved me and how joe never complained of anything she didn t say of me she had no need i knew what she meant but ever did his duty in his way of life with a strong hand a quiet tongue and a gentle heart
indeed it would be hard to say too much for him said i and biddy we must often speak of these things for of course i shall be often down here now
i am not going to leave poor joe alone
biddy said never a single word
biddy don t you hear me
yes mr
pip
not to mention your calling me mr pip which appears to me to be in bad taste biddy what do you mean
what do i mean
asked biddy timidly
biddy said i in a virtuously self asserting manner i must request to know what you mean by this
by this
said biddy
now don t echo i retorted
you used not to echo biddy
used not
said biddy
o mr pip
used
well
i rather thought i would give up that point too
after another silent turn in the garden i fell back on the main position
biddy said i i made a remark respecting my coming down here often to see joe which you received with a marked silence
have the goodness biddy to tell me why
are you quite sure then that you will come to see him often
asked biddy stopping in the narrow garden walk and looking at me under the stars with a clear and honest eye
o dear me
said i as if i found myself compelled to give up biddy in despair
this really is a very bad side of human nature
don t say any more if you please biddy
this shocks me very much
for which cogent reason i kept biddy at a distance during supper and when i went up to my own old little room took as stately a leave of her as i could in my murmuring soul deem reconcilable with the churchyard and the event of the day
as often as i was restless in the night and that was every quarter of an hour i reflected what an unkindness what an injury what an injustice biddy had done me
early in the morning i was to go
early in the morning i was out and looking in unseen at one of the wooden windows of the forge
there i stood for minutes looking at joe already at work with a glow of health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright sun of the life in store for him were shining on it
good bye dear joe no don t wipe it off for god s sake give me your blackened hand i shall be down soon and often
never too soon sir said joe and never too often pip
biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door with a mug of new milk and a crust of bread
biddy said i when i gave her my hand at parting i am not angry but i am hurt
no don t be hurt she pleaded quite pathetically let only me be hurt if i have been ungenerous
once more the mists were rising as i walked away
if they disclosed to me as i suspect they did that i should not come back and that biddy was quite right all i can say is they were quite right too
chapter xxxvi herbert and i went on from bad to worse in the way of increasing our debts looking into our affairs leaving margins and the like exemplary transactions and time went on whether or no as he has a way of doing and i came of age in fulfilment of herbert s prediction that i should do so before i knew where i was
herbert himself had come of age eight months before me
as he had nothing else than his majority to come into the event did not make a profound sensation in barnard s inn
but we had looked forward to my one and twentieth birthday with a crowd of speculations and anticipations for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly help saying something definite on that occasion
i had taken care to have it well understood in little britain when my birthday was
on the day before it i received an official note from wemmick informing me that mr jaggers would be glad if i would call upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day
this convinced us that something great was to happen and threw me into an unusual flutter when i repaired to my guardian s office a model of punctuality
in the outer office wemmick offered me his congratulations and incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of tissue paper that i liked the look of
but he said nothing respecting it and motioned me with a nod into my guardian s room
it was november and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against the chimney piece with his hands under his coattails
well pip said he i must call you mr pip to day
congratulations mr
pip
we shook hands he was always a remarkably short shaker and i thanked him
take a chair mr pip said my guardian
as i sat down and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his boots i felt at a disadvantage which reminded me of that old time when i had been put upon a tombstone
the two ghastly casts on the shelf were not far from him and their expression was as if they were making a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation
now my young friend my guardian began as if i were a witness in the box i am going to have a word or two with you
if you please sir
what do you suppose said mr jaggers bending forward to look at the ground and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling what do you suppose you are living at the rate of
at the rate of sir
at repeated mr jaggers still looking at the ceiling the rate of
and then looked all round the room and paused with his pocket handkerchief in his hand half way to his nose
i had looked into my affairs so often that i had thoroughly destroyed any slight notion i might ever have had of their bearings
reluctantly i confessed myself quite unable to answer the question
this reply seemed agreeable to mr jaggers who said i thought so
and blew his nose with an air of satisfaction
now i have asked you a question my friend said mr jaggers
have you anything to ask me
of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several questions sir but i remember your prohibition
ask one said mr jaggers
is my benefactor to be made known to me to day
no
ask another
is that confidence to be imparted to me soon
waive that a moment said mr jaggers and ask another
i looked about me but there appeared to be now no possible escape from the inquiry have i anything to receive sir
on that mr jaggers said triumphantly i thought we should come to it
and called to wemmick to give him that piece of paper
wemmick appeared handed it in and disappeared
now mr pip said mr jaggers attend if you please
you have been drawing pretty freely here your name occurs pretty often in wemmick s cash book but you are in debt of course
i am afraid i must say yes sir
you know you must say yes don t you
said mr jaggers
yes sir
i don t ask you what you owe because you don t know and if you did know you wouldn t tell me you would say less
yes yes my friend cried mr jaggers waving his forefinger to stop me as i made a show of protesting it s likely enough that you think you wouldn t but you would
you ll excuse me but i know better than you
now take this piece of paper in your hand
you have got it
very good
now unfold it and tell me what it is
this is a bank note said i for five hundred pounds
that is a bank note repeated mr jaggers for five hundred pounds
and a very handsome sum of money too i think
you consider it so
how could i do otherwise
ah
but answer the question said mr jaggers
undoubtedly
you consider it undoubtedly a handsome sum of money
now that handsome sum of money pip is your own
it is a present to you on this day in earnest of your expectations
and at the rate of that handsome sum of money per annum and at no higher rate you are to live until the donor of the whole appears
that is to say you will now take your money affairs entirely into your own hands and you will draw from wemmick one hundred and twenty five pounds per quarter until you are in communication with the fountain head and no longer with the mere agent
as i have told you before i am the mere agent
i execute my instructions and i am paid for doing so
i think them injudicious but i am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits
i was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great liberality with which i was treated when mr jaggers stopped me
i am not paid pip said he coolly to carry your words to any one and then gathered up his coat tails as he had gathered up the subject and stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against him
after a pause i hinted there was a question just now mr jaggers which you desired me to waive for a moment
i hope i am doing nothing wrong in asking it again
what is it
said he
i might have known that he would never help me out but it took me aback to have to shape the question afresh as if it were quite new
is it likely i said after hesitating that my patron the fountain head you have spoken of mr jaggers will soon there i delicately stopped
will soon what
asked mr jaggers
that s no question as it stands you know
will soon come to london said i after casting about for a precise form of words or summon me anywhere else
now here replied mr jaggers fixing me for the first time with his dark deep set eyes we must revert to the evening when we first encountered one another in your village
what did i tell you then pip
you told me mr jaggers that it might be years hence when that person appeared
just so said mr jaggers that s my answer
as we looked full at one another i felt my breath come quicker in my strong desire to get something out of him
and as i felt that it came quicker and as i felt that he saw that it came quicker i felt that i had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him
do you suppose it will still be years hence mr
jaggers
mr jaggers shook his head not in negativing the question but in altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer it and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked when my eyes strayed up to them as if they had come to a crisis in their suspended attention and were going to sneeze
come
said mr jaggers warming the backs of his legs with the backs of his warmed hands i ll be plain with you my friend pip
that s a question i must not be asked
you ll understand that better when i tell you it s a question that might compromise me
come
i ll go a little further with you i ll say something more
he bent down so low to frown at his boots that he was able to rub the calves of his legs in the pause he made
when that person discloses said mr jaggers straightening himself you and that person will settle your own affairs
when that person discloses my part in this business will cease and determine
when that person discloses it will not be necessary for me to know anything about it
and that s all i have got to say
we looked at one another until i withdrew my eyes and looked thoughtfully at the floor
from this last speech i derived the notion that miss havisham for some reason or no reason had not taken him into her confidence as to her designing me for estella that he resented this and felt a jealousy about it or that he really did object to that scheme and would have nothing to do with it
when i raised my eyes again i found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all the time and was doing so still
if that is all you have to say sir i remarked there can be nothing left for me to say
he nodded assent and pulled out his thief dreaded watch and asked me where i was going to dine
i replied at my own chambers with herbert
as a necessary sequence i asked him if he would favor us with his company and he promptly accepted the invitation
but he insisted on walking home with me in order that i might make no extra preparation for him and first he had a letter or two to write and of course had his hands to wash
so i said i would go into the outer office and talk to wemmick
the fact was that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket a thought had come into my head which had been often there before and it appeared to me that wemmick was a good person to advise with concerning such thought
he had already locked up his safe and made preparations for going home
he had left his desk brought out his two greasy office candlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door ready to be extinguished he had raked his fire low put his hat and great coat ready and was beating himself all over the chest with his safe key as an athletic exercise after business
mr wemmick said i i want to ask your opinion
i am very desirous to serve a friend
wemmick tightened his post office and shook his head as if his opinion were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort
this friend i pursued is trying to get on in commercial life but has no money and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a beginning
now i want somehow to help him to a beginning
with money down
said wemmick in a tone drier than any sawdust
with some money down i replied for an uneasy remembrance shot across me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home with some money down and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations
mr pip said wemmick i should like just to run over with you on my fingers if you please the names of the various bridges up as high as chelsea reach
let s see there s london one southwark two blackfriars three waterloo four westminster five vauxhall six
he had checked off each bridge in its turn with the handle of his safe key on the palm of his hand
there s as many as six you see to choose from
i don t understand you said i
choose your bridge mr pip returned wemmick and take a walk upon your bridge and pitch your money into the thames over the centre arch of your bridge and you know the end of it
serve a friend with it and you may know the end of it too but it s a less pleasant and profitable end
i could have posted a newspaper in his mouth he made it so wide after saying this
this is very discouraging said i
meant to be so said wemmick
then is it your opinion i inquired with some little indignation that a man should never invest portable property in a friend
said wemmick
certainly he should not
unless he wants to get rid of the friend and then it becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid of him
and that said i is your deliberate opinion mr
wemmick
that he returned is my deliberate opinion in this office
ah
said i pressing him for i thought i saw him near a loophole here but would that be your opinion at walworth
mr pip he replied with gravity walworth is one place and this office is another
much as the aged is one person and mr jaggers is another
they must not be confounded together
my walworth sentiments must be taken at walworth none but my official sentiments can be taken in this office
very well said i much relieved then i shall look you up at walworth you may depend upon it
mr pip he returned you will be welcome there in a private and personal capacity
we had held this conversation in a low voice well knowing my guardian s ears to be the sharpest of the sharp
as he now appeared in his doorway towelling his hands wemmick got on his great coat and stood by to snuff out the candles
we all three went into the street together and from the door step wemmick turned his way and mr jaggers and i turned ours
i could not help wishing more than once that evening that mr jaggers had had an aged in gerrard street or a stinger or a something or a somebody to unbend his brows a little
it was an uncomfortable consideration on a twenty first birthday that coming of age at all seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he made of it
he was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than wemmick and yet i would a thousand times rather have had wemmick to dinner
and mr jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy because after he was gone herbert said of himself with his eyes fixed on the fire that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the details of it he felt so dejected and guilty
chapter xxxvii deeming sunday the best day for taking mr wemmick s walworth sentiments i devoted the next ensuing sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage to the castle
on arriving before the battlements i found the union jack flying and the drawbridge up but undeterred by this show of defiance and resistance i rang at the gate and was admitted in a most pacific manner by the aged
my son sir said the old man after securing the drawbridge rather had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in and he left word that he would soon be home from his afternoon s walk
he is very regular in his walks is my son
very regular in everything is my son
i nodded at the old gentleman as wemmick himself might have nodded and we went in and sat down by the fireside
you made acquaintance with my son sir said the old man in his chirping way while he warmed his hands at the blaze at his office i expect
i nodded
hah
i have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at his business sir
i nodded hard
yes so they tell me
his business is the law
i nodded harder
which makes it more surprising in my son said the old man for he was not brought up to the law but to the wine coopering
curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the reputation of mr jaggers i roared that name at him
he threw me into the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very sprightly manner no to be sure you re right
and to this hour i have not the faintest notion what he meant or what joke he thought i had made
as i could not sit there nodding at him perpetually without making some other attempt to interest him i shouted at inquiry whether his own calling in life had been the wine coopering
by dint of straining that term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the chest to associate it with him i at last succeeded in making my meaning understood
no said the old gentleman the warehousing the warehousing
first over yonder he appeared to mean up the chimney but i believe he intended to refer me to liverpool and then in the city of london here
however having an infirmity for i am hard of hearing sir i expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment
yes hard of hearing having that infirmity coming upon me my son he went into the law and he took charge of me and he by little and little made out this elegant and beautiful property
but returning to what you said you know pursued the old man again laughing heartily what i say is no to be sure you re right
i was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled me to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this imaginary pleasantry when i was startled by a sudden click in the wall on one side of the chimney and the ghostly tumbling open of a little wooden flap with john upon it
the old man following my eyes cried with great triumph my son s come home
and we both went out to the drawbridge
it was worth any money to see wemmick waving a salute to me from the other side of the moat when we might have shaken hands across it with the greatest ease
the aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge that i made no offer to assist him but stood quiet until wemmick had come across and had presented me to miss skiffins a lady by whom he was accompanied
miss skiffins was of a wooden appearance and was like her escort in the post office branch of the service
she might have been some two or three years younger than wemmick and i judged her to stand possessed of portable property
the cut of her dress from the waist upward both before and behind made her figure very like a boy s kite and i might have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange and her gloves a little too intensely green
but she seemed to be a good sort of fellow and showed a high regard for the aged
i was not long in discovering that she was a frequent visitor at the castle for on our going in and my complimenting wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for announcing himself to the aged he begged me to give my attention for a moment to the other side of the chimney and disappeared
presently another click came and another little door tumbled open with miss skiffins on it then miss skiffins shut up and john tumbled open then miss skiffins and john both tumbled open together and finally shut up together
on wemmick s return from working these mechanical appliances i expressed the great admiration with which i regarded them and he said well you know they re both pleasant and useful to the aged
and by george sir it s a thing worth mentioning that of all the people who come to this gate the secret of those pulls is only known to the aged miss skiffins and me
and mr wemmick made them added miss skiffins with his own hands out of his own head
while miss skiffins was taking off her bonnet she retained her green gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was company wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property and see how the island looked in wintertime
thinking that he did this to give me an opportunity of taking his walworth sentiments i seized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the castle
having thought of the matter with care i approached my subject as if i had never hinted at it before
i informed wemmick that i was anxious in behalf of herbert pocket and i told him how we had first met and how we had fought
i glanced at herbert s home and at his character and at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for those uncertain and unpunctual
i alluded to the advantages i had derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society and i confessed that i feared i had but ill repaid them and that he might have done better without me and my expectations
keeping miss havisham in the background at a great distance i still hinted at the possibility of my having competed with him in his prospects and at the certainty of his possessing a generous soul and being far above any mean distrusts retaliations or designs
for all these reasons i told wemmick and because he was my young companion and friend and i had a great affection for him i wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays upon him and therefore i sought advice from wemmick s experience and knowledge of men and affairs how i could best try with my resources to help herbert to some present income say of a hundred a year to keep him in good hope and heart and gradually to buy him on to some small partnership
i begged wemmick in conclusion to understand that my help must always be rendered without herbert s knowledge or suspicion and that there was no one else in the world with whom i could advise
i wound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder and saying i can t help confiding in you though i know it must be troublesome to you but that is your fault in having ever brought me here
wemmick was silent for a little while and then said with a kind of start well you know mr pip i must tell you one thing
this is devilish good of you
say you ll help me to be good then said i
ecod replied wemmick shaking his head that s not my trade
nor is this your trading place said i
you are right he returned
you hit the nail on the head
mr pip i ll put on my considering cap and i think all you want to do may be done by degrees
skiffins that s her brother is an accountant and agent
i ll look him up and go to work for you
i thank you ten thousand times
on the contrary said he i thank you for though we are strictly in our private and personal capacity still it may be mentioned that there are newgate cobwebs about and it brushes them away
after a little further conversation to the same effect we returned into the castle where we found miss skiffins preparing tea
the responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the aged and that excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger of melting his eyes
it was no nominal meal that we were going to make but a vigorous reality
the aged prepared such a hay stack of buttered toast that i could scarcely see him over it as it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top bar while miss skiffins brewed such a jorum of tea that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited and repeatedly expressed his desire to participate in the entertainment
the flag had been struck and the gun had been fired at the right moment of time and i felt as snugly cut off from the rest of walworth as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep
nothing disturbed the tranquillity of the castle but the occasional tumbling open of john and miss skiffins which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until i got used to it
i inferred from the methodical nature of miss skiffins s arrangements that she made tea there every sunday night and i rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore representing the profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon was a piece of portable property that had been given her by wemmick
we ate the whole of the toast and drank tea in proportion and it was delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it
the aged especially might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage tribe just oiled
after a short pause of repose miss skiffins in the absence of the little servant who it seemed retired to the bosom of her family on sunday afternoons washed up the tea things in a trifling lady like amateur manner that compromised none of us
then she put on her gloves again and we drew round the fire and wemmick said now aged parent tip us the paper
wemmick explained to me while the aged got his spectacles out that this was according to custom and that it gave the old gentleman infinite satisfaction to read the news aloud
i won t offer an apology said wemmick for he isn t capable of many pleasures are you aged p
all right john all right returned the old man seeing himself spoken to
only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper said wemmick and he ll be as happy as a king
we are all attention aged one
all right john all right
returned the cheerful old man so busy and so pleased that it really was quite charming
the aged s reading reminded me of the classes at mr wopsle s great aunt s with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come through a keyhole
as he wanted the candles close to him and as he was always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into them he required as much watching as a powder mill
but wemmick was equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance and the aged read on quite unconscious of his many rescues
whenever he looked at us we all expressed the greatest interest and amazement and nodded until he resumed again
as wemmick and miss skiffins sat side by side and as i sat in a shadowy corner i observed a slow and gradual elongation of mr wemmick s mouth powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round miss skiffins s waist
in course of time i saw his hand appear on the other side of miss skiffins but at that moment miss skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove unwound his arm again as if it were an article of dress and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the table before her
miss skiffins s composure while she did this was one of the most remarkable sights i have ever seen and if i could have thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind i should have deemed that miss skiffins performed it mechanically
by and by i noticed wemmick s arm beginning to disappear again and gradually fading out of view
shortly afterwards his mouth began to widen again
after an interval of suspense on my part that was quite enthralling and almost painful i saw his hand appear on the other side of miss skiffins
instantly miss skiffins stopped it with the neatness of a placid boxer took off that girdle or cestus as before and laid it on the table
taking the table to represent the path of virtue i am justified in stating that during the whole time of the aged s reading wemmick s arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to it by miss skiffins
at last the aged read himself into a light slumber
this was the time for wemmick to produce a little kettle a tray of glasses and a black bottle with a porcelain topped cork representing some clerical dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect
with the aid of these appliances we all had something warm to drink including the aged who was soon awake again
miss skiffins mixed and i observed that she and wemmick drank out of one glass
of course i knew better than to offer to see miss skiffins home and under the circumstances i thought i had best go first which i did taking a cordial leave of the aged and having passed a pleasant evening
before a week was out i received a note from wemmick dated walworth stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter appertaining to our private and personal capacities and that he would be glad if i could come and see him again upon it
so i went out to walworth again and yet again and yet again and i saw him by appointment in the city several times but never held any communication with him on the subject in or near little britain
the upshot was that we found a worthy young merchant or shipping broker not long established in business who wanted intelligent help and who wanted capital and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner
between him and me secret articles were signed of which herbert was the subject and i paid him half of my five hundred pounds down and engaged for sundry other payments some to fall due at certain dates out of my income some contingent on my coming into my property
miss skiffins s brother conducted the negotiation
wemmick pervaded it throughout but never appeared in it
the whole business was so cleverly managed that herbert had not the least suspicion of my hand being in it
i never shall forget the radiant face with which he came home one afternoon and told me as a mighty piece of news of his having fallen in with one clarriker the young merchant s name and of clarriker s having shown an extraordinary inclination towards him and of his belief that the opening had come at last
day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter he must have thought me a more and more affectionate friend for i had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when i saw him so happy
at length the thing being done and he having that day entered clarriker s house and he having talked to me for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success i did really cry in good earnest when i went to bed to think that my expectations had done some good to somebody
a great event in my life the turning point of my life now opens on my view
but before i proceed to narrate it and before i pass on to all the changes it involved i must give one chapter to estella
it is not much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart
chapter xxxviii if that staid old house near the green at richmond should ever come to be haunted when i am dead it will be haunted surely by my ghost
o the many many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within me haunted that house when estella lived there
let my body be where it would my spirit was always wandering wandering wandering about that house
the lady with whom estella was placed mrs brandley by name was a widow with one daughter several years older than estella
the mother looked young and the daughter looked old the mother s complexion was pink and the daughter s was yellow the mother set up for frivolity and the daughter for theology
they were in what is called a good position and visited and were visited by numbers of people
little if any community of feeling subsisted between them and estella but the understanding was established that they were necessary to her and that she was necessary to them
mrs brandley had been a friend of miss havisham s before the time of her seclusion
in mrs brandley s house and out of mrs brandley s house i suffered every kind and degree of torture that estella could cause me
the nature of my relations with her which placed me on terms of familiarity without placing me on terms of favor conduced to my distraction
she made use of me to tease other admirers and she turned the very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant slight on my devotion to her
if i had been her secretary steward half brother poor relation if i had been a younger brother of her appointed husband i could not have seemed to myself further from my hopes when i was nearest to her
the privilege of calling her by her name and hearing her call me by mine became under the circumstances an aggravation of my trials and while i think it likely that it almost maddened her other lovers i know too certainly that it almost maddened me
she had admirers without end
no doubt my jealousy made an admirer of every one who went near her but there were more than enough of them without that
i saw her often at richmond i heard of her often in town and i used often to take her and the brandleys on the water there were picnics fête days plays operas concerts parties all sorts of pleasures through which i pursued her and they were all miseries to me
i never had one hour s happiness in her society and yet my mind all round the four and twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with me unto death
throughout this part of our intercourse and it lasted as will presently be seen for what i then thought a long time she habitually reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced upon us
there were other times when she would come to a sudden check in this tone and in all her many tones and would seem to pity me
pip pip she said one evening coming to such a check when we sat apart at a darkening window of the house in richmond will you never take warning
of what
of me
warning not to be attracted by you do you mean estella
do i mean
if you don t know what i mean you are blind
i should have replied that love was commonly reputed blind but for the reason that i always was restrained and this was not the least of my miseries by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her when she knew that she could not choose but obey miss havisham
my dread always was that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy disadvantage with her pride and made me the subject of a rebellious struggle in her bosom
at any rate said i i have no warning given me just now for you wrote to me to come to you this time
that s true said estella with a cold careless smile that always chilled me
after looking at the twilight without for a little while she went on to say the time has come round when miss havisham wishes to have me for a day at satis
you are to take me there and bring me back if you will
she would rather i did not travel alone and objects to receiving my maid for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people
can you take me
can i take you estella
you can then
the day after to morrow if you please
you are to pay all charges out of my purse you hear the condition of your going
and must obey said i
this was all the preparation i received for that visit or for others like it miss havisham never wrote to me nor had i ever so much as seen her handwriting
we went down on the next day but one and we found her in the room where i had first beheld her and it is needless to add that there was no change in satis house
she was even more dreadfully fond of estella than she had been when i last saw them together i repeat the word advisedly for there was something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces
she hung upon estella s beauty hung upon her words hung upon her gestures and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked at her as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had reared
from estella she looked at me with a searching glance that seemed to pry into my heart and probe its wounds
how does she use you pip how does she use you
she asked me again with her witch like eagerness even in estella s hearing
but when we sat by her flickering fire at night she was most weird for then keeping estella s hand drawn through her arm and clutched in her own hand she extorted from her by dint of referring back to what estella had told her in her regular letters the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated and as miss havisham dwelt upon this roll with the intensity of a mind mortally hurt and diseased she sat with her other hand on her crutch stick and her chin on that and her wan bright eyes glaring at me a very spectre
i saw in this wretched though it made me and bitter the sense of dependence and even of degradation that it awakened i saw in this that estella was set to wreak miss havisham s revenge on men and that she was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term
i saw in this a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me
sending her out to attract and torment and do mischief miss havisham sent her with the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose
i saw in this that i too was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity even while the prize was reserved for me
i saw in this the reason for my being staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian s declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme
in a word i saw in this miss havisham as i had her then and there before my eyes and always had had her before my eyes and i saw in this the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden from the sun
the candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on the wall
they were high from the ground and they burnt with the steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed
as i looked round at them and at the pale gloom they made and at the stopped clock and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and the ground and at her own awful figure with its ghostly reflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall i saw in everything the construction that my mind had come to repeated and thrown back to me
my thoughts passed into the great room across the landing where the table was spread and i saw it written as it were in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre piece in the crawlings of the spiders on the cloth in the tracks of the mice as they betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels and in the gropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor
it happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose between estella and miss havisham
it was the first time i had ever seen them opposed
we were seated by the fire as just now described and miss havisham still had estella s arm drawn through her own and still clutched estella s hand in hers when estella gradually began to detach herself
she had shown a proud impatience more than once before and had rather endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it
what
said miss havisham flashing her eyes upon her are you tired of me
only a little tired of myself replied estella disengaging her arm and moving to the great chimney piece where she stood looking down at the fire
speak the truth you ingrate
cried miss havisham passionately striking her stick upon the floor you are tired of me
estella looked at her with perfect composure and again looked down at the fire
her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a self possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other that was almost cruel
you stock and stone
exclaimed miss havisham
you cold cold heart
what
said estella preserving her attitude of indifference as she leaned against the great chimney piece and only moving her eyes do you reproach me for being cold
you
are you not
was the fierce retort
you should know said estella
i am what you have made me
take all the praise take all the blame take all the success take all the failure in short take me
o look at her look at her
cried miss havisham bitterly look at her so hard and thankless on the hearth where she was reared
where i took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its stabs and where i have lavished years of tenderness upon her
at least i was no party to the compact said estella for if i could walk and speak when it was made it was as much as i could do
but what would you have
you have been very good to me and i owe everything to you
what would you have
love replied the other
you have it
i have not said miss havisham
mother by adoption retorted estella never departing from the easy grace of her attitude never raising her voice as the other did never yielding either to anger or tenderness mother by adoption i have said that i owe everything to you
all i possess is freely yours
all that you have given me is at your command to have again
beyond that i have nothing
and if you ask me to give you what you never gave me my gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities
did i never give her love
cried miss havisham turning wildly to me
did i never give her a burning love inseparable from jealousy at all times and from sharp pain while she speaks thus to me
let her call me mad let her call me mad
why should i call you mad returned estella i of all people
does any one live who knows what set purposes you have half as well as i do
does any one live who knows what a steady memory you have half as well as i do
i who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool that is even now beside you there learning your lessons and looking up into your face when your face was strange and frightened me
soon forgotten
moaned miss havisham
times soon forgotten
no not forgotten retorted estella not forgotten but treasured up in my memory
when have you found me false to your teaching
when have you found me unmindful of your lessons
when have you found me giving admission here she touched her bosom with her hand to anything that you excluded
be just to me
so proud so proud
moaned miss havisham pushing away her gray hair with both her hands
who taught me to be proud
returned estella
who praised me when i learnt my lesson
so hard so hard
moaned miss havisham with her former action
who taught me to be hard
returned estella
who praised me when i learnt my lesson
but to be proud and hard to me
miss havisham quite shrieked as she stretched out her arms
estella estella estella to be proud and hard to me
estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder but was not otherwise disturbed when the moment was past she looked down at the fire again
i cannot think said estella raising her eyes after a silence why you should be so unreasonable when i come to see you after a separation
i have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes
i have never been unfaithful to you or your schooling
i have never shown any weakness that i can charge myself with
would it be weakness to return my love
exclaimed miss havisham
but yes yes she would call it so
i begin to think said estella in a musing way after another moment of calm wonder that i almost understand how this comes about
if you had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of these rooms and had never let her know that there was such a thing as the daylight by which she had never once seen your face if you had done that and then for a purpose had wanted her to understand the daylight and know all about it you would have been disappointed and angry
miss havisham with her head in her hands sat making a low moaning and swaying herself on her chair but gave no answer
or said estella which is a nearer case if you had taught her from the dawn of her intelligence with your utmost energy and might that there was such a thing as daylight but that it was made to be her enemy and destroyer and she must always turn against it for it had blighted you and would else blight her if you had done this and then for a purpose had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she could not do it you would have been disappointed and angry
miss havisham sat listening or it seemed so for i could not see her face but still made no answer
so said estella i must be taken as i have been made
the success is not mine the failure is not mine but the two together make me
miss havisham had settled down i hardly knew how upon the floor among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn
i took advantage of the moment i had sought one from the first to leave the room after beseeching estella s attention to her with a movement of my hand
when i left estella was yet standing by the great chimney piece just as she had stood throughout
miss havisham s gray hair was all adrift upon the ground among the other bridal wrecks and was a miserable sight to see
it was with a depressed heart that i walked in the starlight for an hour and more about the courtyard and about the brewery and about the ruined garden
when i at last took courage to return to the room i found estella sitting at miss havisham s knee taking up some stitches in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces and of which i have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old banners that i have seen hanging up in cathedrals
afterwards estella and i played at cards as of yore only we were skilful now and played french games and so the evening wore away and i went to bed
i lay in that separate building across the courtyard
it was the first time i had ever lain down to rest in satis house and sleep refused to come near me
a thousand miss havishams haunted me
she was on this side of my pillow on that at the head of the bed at the foot behind the half opened door of the dressing room in the dressing room in the room overhead in the room beneath everywhere
at last when the night was slow to creep on towards two o clock i felt that i absolutely could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in and that i must get up
i therefore got up and put on my clothes and went out across the yard into the long stone passage designing to gain the outer courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind
but i was no sooner in the passage than i extinguished my candle for i saw miss havisham going along it in a ghostly manner making a low cry
i followed her at a distance and saw her go up the staircase
she carried a bare candle in her hand which she had probably taken from one of the sconces in her own room and was a most unearthly object by its light
standing at the bottom of the staircase i felt the mildewed air of the feast chamber without seeing her open the door and i heard her walking there and so across into her own room and so across again into that never ceasing the low cry
after a time i tried in the dark both to get out and to go back but i could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands
during the whole interval whenever i went to the bottom of the staircase i heard her footstep saw her light pass above and heard her ceaseless low cry
before we left next day there was no revival of the difference between her and estella nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion and there were four similar occasions to the best of my remembrance
nor did miss havisham s manner towards estella in anywise change except that i believed it to have something like fear infused among its former characteristics
it is impossible to turn this leaf of my life without putting bentley drummle s name upon it or i would very gladly
on a certain occasion when the finches were assembled in force and when good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody s agreeing with anybody else the presiding finch called the grove to order forasmuch as mr drummle had not yet toasted a lady which according to the solemn constitution of the society it was the brute s turn to do that day
i thought i saw him leer in an ugly way at me while the decanters were going round but as there was no love lost between us that might easily be
what was my indignant surprise when he called upon the company to pledge him to estella
estella who
said i
never you mind retorted drummle
estella of where
said i
you are bound to say of where
which he was as a finch
of richmond gentlemen said drummle putting me out of the question and a peerless beauty
much he knew about peerless beauties a mean miserable idiot
i whispered herbert
i know that lady said herbert across the table when the toast had been honored
do you
said drummle
and so do i i added with a scarlet face
do you
said drummle
o lord
this was the only retort except glass or crockery that the heavy creature was capable of making but i became as highly incensed by it as if it had been barbed with wit and i immediately rose in my place and said that i could not but regard it as being like the honorable finch s impudence to come down to that grove we always talked about coming down to that grove as a neat parliamentary turn of expression down to that grove proposing a lady of whom he knew nothing
mr drummle upon this starting up demanded what i meant by that
whereupon i made him the extreme reply that i believed he knew where i was to be found
whether it was possible in a christian country to get on without blood after this was a question on which the finches were divided
the debate upon it grew so lively indeed that at least six more honorable members told six more during the discussion that they believed they knew where they were to be found
however it was decided at last the grove being a court of honor that if mr drummle would bring never so slight a certificate from the lady importing that he had the honor of her acquaintance mr pip must express his regret as a gentleman and a finch for having been betrayed into a warmth which
next day was appointed for the production lest our honor should take cold from delay and next day drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in estella s hand that she had had the honor of dancing with him several times
this left me no course but to regret that i had been betrayed into a warmth which and on the whole to repudiate as untenable the idea that i was to be found anywhere
drummle and i then sat snorting at one another for an hour while the grove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing rate
i tell this lightly but it was no light thing to me
for i cannot adequately express what pain it gave me to think that estella should show any favor to a contemptible clumsy sulky booby so very far below the average
to the present moment i believe it to have been referable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for her that i could not endure the thought of her stooping to that hound
no doubt i should have been miserable whomsoever she had favored but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of distress
it was easy for me to find out and i did soon find out that drummle had begun to follow her closely and that she allowed him to do it
a little while and he was always in pursuit of her and he and i crossed one another every day
he held on in a dull persistent way and estella held him on now with encouragement now with discouragement now almost flattering him now openly despising him now knowing him very well now scarcely remembering who he was
the spider as mr jaggers had called him was used to lying in wait however and had the patience of his tribe
added to that he had a blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness which sometimes did him good service almost taking the place of concentration and determined purpose
so the spider doggedly watching estella outwatched many brighter insects and would often uncoil himself and drop at the right nick of time
at a certain assembly ball at richmond there used to be assembly balls at most places then where estella had outshone all other beauties this blundering drummle so hung about her and with so much toleration on her part that i resolved to speak to her concerning him
i took the next opportunity which was when she was waiting for mrs blandley to take her home and was sitting apart among some flowers ready to go
i was with her for i almost always accompanied them to and from such places
are you tired estella
rather pip
you should be
say rather i should not be for i have my letter to satis house to write before i go to sleep
recounting to night s triumph
said i
surely a very poor one estella
what do you mean
i didn t know there had been any
estella said i do look at that fellow in the corner yonder who is looking over here at us
why should i look at him
returned estella with her eyes on me instead
what is there in that fellow in the corner yonder to use your words that i need look at
indeed that is the very question i want to ask you said i
for he has been hovering about you all night
moths and all sorts of ugly creatures replied estella with a glance towards him hover about a lighted candle
can the candle help it
no i returned but cannot the estella help it
well
said she laughing after a moment perhaps
yes
anything you like
but estella do hear me speak
it makes me wretched that you should encourage a man so generally despised as drummle
you know he is despised
well
said she
you know he is as ungainly within as without
a deficient ill tempered lowering stupid fellow
well
said she
you know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous roll of addle headed predecessors now don t you
well
said she again and each time she said it she opened her lovely eyes the wider
to overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable i took it from her and said repeating it with emphasis well
then that is why it makes me wretched
now if i could have believed that she favored drummle with any idea of making me me wretched i should have been in better heart about it but in that habitual way of hers she put me so entirely out of the question that i could believe nothing of the kind
pip said estella casting her glance over the room don t be foolish about its effect on you
it may have its effect on others and may be meant to have
it s not worth discussing
yes it is said i because i cannot bear that people should say she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor the lowest in the crowd
i can bear it said estella
oh
don t be so proud estella and so inflexible
calls me proud and inflexible in this breath
said estella opening her hands
and in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a boor
there is no doubt you do said i something hurriedly for i have seen you give him looks and smiles this very night such as you never give to me
do you want me then said estella turning suddenly with a fixed and serious if not angry look to deceive and entrap you
do you deceive and entrap him estella
yes and many others all of them but you
here is mrs brandley
i ll say no more
and now that i have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my heart and so often made it ache and ache again i pass on unhindered to the event that had impended over me longer yet the event that had begun to be prepared for before i knew that the world held estella and in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving its first distortions from miss havisham s wasting hands
in the eastern story the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry the tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through the leagues of rock the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to the great iron ring
all being made ready with much labor and the hour come the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night and the sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his hand and he struck with it and the rope parted and rushed away and the ceiling fell
so in my case all the work near and afar that tended to the end had been accomplished and in an instant the blow was struck and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me
chapter xxxix i was three and twenty years of age
not another word had i heard to enlighten me on the subject of my expectations and my twenty third birthday was a week gone
we had left barnard s inn more than a year and lived in the temple
our chambers were in garden court down by the river
mr pocket and i had for some time parted company as to our original relations though we continued on the best terms
notwithstanding my inability to settle to anything which i hope arose out of the restless and incomplete tenure on which i held my means i had a taste for reading and read regularly so many hours a day
that matter of herbert s was still progressing and everything with me was as i have brought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter
business had taken herbert on a journey to marseilles
i was alone and had a dull sense of being alone
dispirited and anxious long hoping that to morrow or next week would clear my way and long disappointed i sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend
it was wretched weather stormy and wet stormy and wet and mud mud mud deep in all the streets
day after day a vast heavy veil had been driving over london from the east and it drove still as if in the east there were an eternity of cloud and wind
so furious had been the gusts that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs and in the country trees had been torn up and sails of windmills carried away and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast of shipwreck and death
violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages of wind and the day just closed as i sat down to read had been the worst of all
alterations have been made in that part of the temple since that time and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then nor is it so exposed to the river
we lived at the top of the last house and the wind rushing up the river shook the house that night like discharges of cannon or breakings of a sea
when the rain came with it and dashed against the windows i thought raising my eyes to them as they rocked that i might have fancied myself in a storm beaten lighthouse
occasionally the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could not bear to go out into such a night and when i set the doors open and looked down the staircase the staircase lamps were blown out and when i shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of such wind and rain i saw that the lamps in the court were blown out and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering and that the coal fires in barges on the river were being carried away before the wind like red hot splashes in the rain
i read with my watch upon the table purposing to close my book at eleven o clock
as i shut it saint paul s and all the many church clocks in the city some leading some accompanying some following struck that hour
the sound was curiously flawed by the wind and i was listening and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it when i heard a footstep on the stair
what nervous folly made me start and awfully connect it with the footstep of my dead sister matters not
it was past in a moment and i listened again and heard the footstep stumble in coming on
remembering then that the staircase lights were blown out i took up my reading lamp and went out to the stair head
whoever was below had stopped on seeing my lamp for all was quiet
there is some one down there is there not
i called out looking down
yes said a voice from the darkness beneath
what floor do you want
the top
mr
pip
that is my name there is nothing the matter
nothing the matter returned the voice
and the man came on
i stood with my lamp held out over the stair rail and he came slowly within its light
it was a shaded lamp to shine upon a book and its circle of light was very contracted so that he was in it for a mere instant and then out of it
in the instant i had seen a face that was strange to me looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched and pleased by the sight of me
moving the lamp as the man moved i made out that he was substantially dressed but roughly like a voyager by sea
that he had long iron gray hair
that his age was about sixty
that he was a muscular man strong on his legs and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to weather
as he ascended the last stair or two and the light of my lamp included us both i saw with a stupid kind of amazement that he was holding out both his hands to me
pray what is your business
i asked him
my business
he repeated pausing
ah
yes
i will explain my business by your leave
do you wish to come in
yes he replied i wish to come in master
i had asked him the question inhospitably enough for i resented the sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face
i resented it because it seemed to imply that he expected me to respond to it
but i took him into the room i had just left and having set the lamp on the table asked him as civilly as i could to explain himself
he looked about him with the strangest air an air of wondering pleasure as if he had some part in the things he admired and he pulled off a rough outer coat and his hat
then i saw that his head was furrowed and bald and that the long iron gray hair grew only on its sides
but i saw nothing that in the least explained him
on the contrary i saw him next moment once more holding out both his hands to me
what do you mean
said i half suspecting him to be mad
he stopped in his looking at me and slowly rubbed his right hand over his head
it s disapinting to a man he said in a coarse broken voice arter having looked for ard so distant and come so fur but you re not to blame for that neither on us is to blame for that
i ll speak in half a minute
give me half a minute please
he sat down on a chair that stood before the fire and covered his forehead with his large brown veinous hands
i looked at him attentively then and recoiled a little from him but i did not know him
there s no one nigh said he looking over his shoulder is there
why do you a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night ask that question
said i
you re a game one he returned shaking his head at me with a deliberate affection at once most unintelligible and most exasperating i m glad you ve grow d up a game one
but don t catch hold of me
you d be sorry arterwards to have done it
i relinquished the intention he had detected for i knew him
even yet i could not recall a single feature but i knew him
if the wind and the rain had driven away the intervening years had scattered all the intervening objects had swept us to the churchyard where we first stood face to face on such different levels i could not have known my convict more distinctly than i knew him now as he sat in the chair before the fire
no need to take a file from his pocket and show it to me no need to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round his head no need to hug himself with both his arms and take a shivering turn across the room looking back at me for recognition
i knew him before he gave me one of those aids though a moment before i had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his identity
he came back to where i stood and again held out both his hands
not knowing what to do for in my astonishment i had lost my self possession i reluctantly gave him my hands
he grasped them heartily raised them to his lips kissed them and still held them
you acted noble my boy said he
noble pip
and i have never forgot it
at a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me i laid a hand upon his breast and put him away
stay
said i
keep off
if you are grateful to me for what i did when i was a little child i hope you have shown your gratitude by mending your way of life
if you have come here to thank me it was not necessary
still however you have found me out there must be something good in the feeling that has brought you here and i will not repulse you but surely you must understand that i my attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at me that the words died away on my tongue
you was a saying he observed when we had confronted one another in silence that surely i must understand
what surely must i understand
that i cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long ago under these different circumstances
i am glad to believe you have repented and recovered yourself
i am glad to tell you so
i am glad that thinking i deserve to be thanked you have come to thank me
but our ways are different ways none the less
you are wet and you look weary
will you drink something before you go
he had replaced his neckerchief loosely and had stood keenly observant of me biting a long end of it
i think he answered still with the end at his mouth and still observant of me that i will drink i thank you afore i go
there was a tray ready on a side table
i brought it to the table near the fire and asked him what he would have
he touched one of the bottles without looking at it or speaking and i made him some hot rum and water
i tried to keep my hand steady while i did so but his look at me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his neckerchief between his teeth evidently forgotten made my hand very difficult to master
when at last i put the glass to him i saw with amazement that his eyes were full of tears
up to this time i had remained standing not to disguise that i wished him gone
but i was softened by the softened aspect of the man and felt a touch of reproach
i hope said i hurriedly putting something into a glass for myself and drawing a chair to the table that you will not think i spoke harshly to you just now
i had no intention of doing it and i am sorry for it if i did
i wish you well and happy
as i put my glass to my lips he glanced with surprise at the end of his neckerchief dropping from his mouth when he opened it and stretched out his hand
i gave him mine and then he drank and drew his sleeve across his eyes and forehead
how are you living
i asked him
i ve been a sheep farmer stock breeder other trades besides away in the new world said he many a thousand mile of stormy water off from this
i hope you have done well
i ve done wonderfully well
there s others went out alonger me as has done well too but no man has done nigh as well as me
i m famous for it
i am glad to hear it
i hope to hear you say so my dear boy
without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which they were spoken i turned off to a point that had just come into my mind
have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me i inquired since he undertook that trust
never set eyes upon him
i warn t likely to it
he came faithfully and he brought me the two one pound notes
i was a poor boy then as you know and to a poor boy they were a little fortune
but like you i have done well since and you must let me pay them back
you can put them to some other poor boy s use
i took out my purse
he watched me as i laid my purse upon the table and opened it and he watched me as i separated two one pound notes from its contents
they were clean and new and i spread them out and handed them over to him
still watching me he laid them one upon the other folded them long wise gave them a twist set fire to them at the lamp and dropped the ashes into the tray
may i make so bold he said then with a smile that was like a frown and with a frown that was like a smile as ask you how you have done well since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes
how
ah
he emptied his glass got up and stood at the side of the fire with his heavy brown hand on the mantel shelf
he put a foot up to the bars to dry and warm it and the wet boot began to steam but he neither looked at it nor at the fire but steadily looked at me
it was only now that i began to tremble
when my lips had parted and had shaped some words that were without sound i forced myself to tell him though i could not do it distinctly that i had been chosen to succeed to some property
might a mere warmint ask what property
said he
i faltered i don t know
might a mere warmint ask whose property
said he
i faltered again i don t know
could i make a guess i wonder said the convict at your income since you come of age
as to the first figure now
five
with my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action i rose out of my chair and stood with my hand upon the back of it looking wildly at him
concerning a guardian he went on
there ought to have been some guardian or such like whiles you was a minor
some lawyer maybe
as to the first letter of that lawyer s name now
would it be j
all the truth of my position came flashing on me and its disappointments dangers disgraces consequences of all kinds rushed in in such a multitude that i was borne down by them and had to struggle for every breath i drew
put it he resumed as the employer of that lawyer whose name begun with a j and might be jaggers put it as he had come over sea to portsmouth and had landed there and had wanted to come on to you
however you have found me out you says just now
well
however did i find you out
why i wrote from portsmouth to a person in london for particulars of your address
that person s name
why wemmick
i could not have spoken one word though it had been to save my life
i stood with a hand on the chair back and a hand on my breast where i seemed to be suffocating i stood so looking wildly at him until i grasped at the chair when the room began to surge and turn
he caught me drew me to the sofa put me up against the cushions and bent on one knee before me bringing the face that i now well remembered and that i shuddered at very near to mine
yes pip dear boy i ve made a gentleman on you
it s me wot has done it
i swore that time sure as ever i earned a guinea that guinea should go to you
i swore arterwards sure as ever i spec lated and got rich you should get rich
i lived rough that you should live smooth i worked hard that you should be above work
what odds dear boy
do i tell it fur you to feel a obligation
not a bit
i tell it fur you to know as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in got his head so high that he could make a gentleman and pip you re him
the abhorrence in which i held the man the dread i had of him the repugnance with which i shrank from him could not have been exceeded if he had been some terrible beast
look ee here pip
i m your second father
you re my son more to me nor any son
i ve put away money only for you to spend
when i was a hired out shepherd in a solitary hut not seeing no faces but faces of sheep till i half forgot wot men s and women s faces wos like i see yourn
i drops my knife many a time in that hut when i was a eating my dinner or my supper and i says here s the boy again a looking at me whiles i eats and drinks
i see you there a many times as plain as ever i see you on them misty marshes
lord strike me dead
i says each time and i goes out in the air to say it under the open heavens but wot if i gets liberty and money i ll make that boy a gentleman
and i done it
why look at you dear boy
look at these here lodgings o yourn fit for a lord
a lord
ah
you shall show money with lords for wagers and beat em
in his heat and triumph and in his knowledge that i had been nearly fainting he did not remark on my reception of all this
it was the one grain of relief i had
look ee here
he went on taking my watch out of my pocket and turning towards him a ring on my finger while i recoiled from his touch as if he had been a snake a gold un and a beauty that s a gentleman s i hope
a diamond all set round with rubies that s a gentleman s i hope
look at your linen fine and beautiful
look at your clothes better ain t to be got
and your books too turning his eyes round the room mounting up on their shelves by hundreds
and you read em don t you
i see you d been a reading of em when i come in
ha ha ha
you shall read em to me dear boy
and if they re in foreign languages wot i don t understand i shall be just as proud as if i did
again he took both my hands and put them to his lips while my blood ran cold within me
don t you mind talking pip said he after again drawing his sleeve over his eyes and forehead as the click came in his throat which i well remembered and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so much in earnest you can t do better nor keep quiet dear boy
you ain t looked slowly forward to this as i have you wosn t prepared for this as i wos
but didn t you never think it might be me
o no no no i returned never never
well you see it wos me and single handed
never a soul in it but my own self and mr
jaggers
was there no one else
i asked
no said he with a glance of surprise who else should there be
and dear boy how good looking you have growed
there s bright eyes somewheres eh
isn t there bright eyes somewheres wot you love the thoughts on
o estella estella
they shall be yourn dear boy if money can buy em
not that a gentleman like you so well set up as you can t win em off of his own game but money shall back you
let me finish wot i was a telling you dear boy
from that there hut and that there hiring out i got money left me by my master which died and had been the same as me and got my liberty and went for myself
in every single thing i went for i went for you
lord strike a blight upon it i says wotever it was i went for if it ain t for him
it all prospered wonderful
as i giv you to understand just now i m famous for it
it was the money left me and the gains of the first few year wot i sent home to mr jaggers all for you when he first come arter you agreeable to my letter
o that he had never come
that he had left me at the forge far from contented yet by comparison happy
and then dear boy it was a recompense to me look ee here to know in secret that i was making a gentleman
the blood horses of them colonists might fling up the dust over me as i was walking what do i say
i says to myself i m making a better gentleman nor ever you ll be
when one of em says to another he was a convict a few year ago and is a ignorant common fellow now for all he s lucky what do i say
i says to myself if i ain t a gentleman nor yet ain t got no learning i m the owner of such
all on you owns stock and land which on you owns a brought up london gentleman
this way i kep myself a going
and this way i held steady afore my mind that i would for certain come one day and see my boy and make myself known to him on his own ground
he laid his hand on my shoulder
i shuddered at the thought that for anything i knew his hand might be stained with blood
it warn t easy pip for me to leave them parts nor yet it warn t safe
but i held to it and the harder it was the stronger i held for i was determined and my mind firm made up
at last i done it
dear boy i done it
i tried to collect my thoughts but i was stunned
throughout i had seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him even now i could not separate his voice from those voices though those were loud and his was silent
where will you put me
he asked presently
i must be put somewheres dear boy
to sleep
said i
yes
and to sleep long and sound he answered for i ve been sea tossed and sea washed months and months
my friend and companion said i rising from the sofa is absent you must have his room
he won t come back to morrow will he
no said i answering almost mechanically in spite of my utmost efforts not to morrow
because look ee here dear boy he said dropping his voice and laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner caution is necessary
how do you mean
caution
by g it s death
what s death
i was sent for life
it s death to come back
there s been overmuch coming back of late years and i should of a certainty be hanged if took
nothing was needed but this the wretched man after loading wretched me with his gold and silver chains for years had risked his life to come to me and i held it there in my keeping
if i had loved him instead of abhorring him if i had been attracted to him by the strongest admiration and affection instead of shrinking from him with the strongest repugnance it could have been no worse
on the contrary it would have been better for his preservation would then have naturally and tenderly addressed my heart
my first care was to close the shutters so that no light might be seen from without and then to close and make fast the doors
while i did so he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit and when i saw him thus engaged i saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again
it almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently to file at his leg
when i had gone into herbert s room and had shut off any other communication between it and the staircase than through the room in which our conversation had been held i asked him if he would go to bed
he said yes but asked me for some of my gentleman s linen to put on in the morning
i brought it out and laid it ready for him and my blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me good night
i got away from him without knowing how i did it and mended the fire in the room where we had been together and sat down by it afraid to go to bed
for an hour or more i remained too stunned to think and it was not until i began to think that i began fully to know how wrecked i was and how the ship in which i had sailed was gone to pieces
miss havisham s intentions towards me all a mere dream estella not designed for me i only suffered in satis house as a convenience a sting for the greedy relations a model with a mechanical heart to practise on when no other practice was at hand those were the first smarts i had
but sharpest and deepest pain of all it was for the convict guilty of i knew not what crimes and liable to be taken out of those rooms where i sat thinking and hanged at the old bailey door that i had deserted joe
i would not have gone back to joe now i would not have gone back to biddy now for any consideration simply i suppose because my sense of my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration
no wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that i should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity but i could never never undo what i had done
in every rage of wind and rush of rain i heard pursuers
twice i could have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door
with these fears upon me i began either to imagine or recall that i had had mysterious warnings of this man s approach
that for weeks gone by i had passed faces in the streets which i had thought like his
that these likenesses had grown more numerous as he coming over the sea had drawn nearer
that his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers to mine and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word and with me
crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that i had seen him with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man that i had heard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him that i had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild beast
out of such remembrances i brought into the light of the fire a half formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with him in the dead of the wild solitary night
this dilated until it filled the room and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my dreadful burden
he had rolled a handkerchief round his head and his face was set and lowering in his sleep
but he was asleep and quietly too though he had a pistol lying on the pillow
assured of this i softly removed the key to the outside of his door and turned it on him before i again sat down by the fire
gradually i slipped from the chair and lay on the floor
when i awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of my wretchedness the clocks of the eastward churches were striking five the candles were wasted out the fire was dead and the wind and rain intensified the thick black darkness
this is the end of the second stage of pip s expectations
chapter xl it was fortunate for me that i had to take precautions to ensure so far as i could the safety of my dreaded visitor for this thought pressing on me when i awoke held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a distance
the impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was self evident
it could not be done and the attempt to do it would inevitably engender suspicion
true i had no avenger in my service now but i was looked after by an inflammatory old female assisted by an animated rag bag whom she called her niece and to keep a room secret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration
they both had weak eyes which i had long attributed to their chronically looking in at keyholes and they were always at hand when not wanted indeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny
not to get up a mystery with these people i resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle had unexpectedly come from the country
this course i decided on while i was yet groping about in the darkness for the means of getting a light
not stumbling on the means after all i was fain to go out to the adjacent lodge and get the watchman there to come with his lantern
now in groping my way down the black staircase i fell over something and that something was a man crouching in a corner
as the man made no answer when i asked him what he did there but eluded my touch in silence i ran to the lodge and urged the watchman to come quickly telling him of the incident on the way back
the wind being as fierce as ever we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase but we examined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there
it then occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my rooms so lighting my candle at the watchman s and leaving him standing at the door i examined them carefully including the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep
all was quiet and assuredly no other man was in those chambers
it troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs on that night of all nights in the year and i asked the watchman on the chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as i handed him a dram at the door whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had perceptibly been dining out
yes he said at different times of the night three
one lived in fountain court and the other two lived in the lane and he had seen them all go home
again the only other man who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in the country for some weeks and he certainly had not returned in the night because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came upstairs
the night being so bad sir said the watchman as he gave me back my glass uncommon few have come in at my gate
besides them three gentlemen that i have named i don t call to mind another since about eleven o clock when a stranger asked for you
my uncle i muttered
yes
you saw him sir
yes
oh yes
likewise the person with him
person with him
i repeated
i judged the person to be with him returned the watchman
the person stopped when he stopped to make inquiry of me and the person took this way when he took this way
what sort of person
the watchman had not particularly noticed he should say a working person to the best of his belief he had a dust colored kind of clothes on under a dark coat
the watchman made more light of the matter than i did and naturally not having my reason for attaching weight to it
when i had got rid of him which i thought it well to do without prolonging explanations my mind was much troubled by these two circumstances taken together
whereas they were easy of innocent solution apart as for instance some diner out or diner at home who had not gone near this watchman s gate might have strayed to my staircase and dropped asleep there and my nameless visitor might have brought some one with him to show him the way still joined they had an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a few hours had made me
i lighted my fire which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the morning and fell into a doze before it
i seemed to have been dozing a whole night when the clocks struck six
as there was full an hour and a half between me and daylight i dozed again now waking up uneasily with prolix conversations about nothing in my ears now making thunder of the wind in the chimney at length falling off into a profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start
all this time i had never been able to consider my own situation nor could i do so yet
i had not the power to attend to it
i was greatly dejected and distressed but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way
as to forming any plan for the future i could as soon have formed an elephant
when i opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild morning all of a leaden hue when i walked from room to room when i sat down again shivering before the fire waiting for my laundress to appear i thought how miserable i was but hardly knew why or how long i had been so or on what day of the week i made the reflection or even who i was that made it
at last the old woman and the niece came in the latter with a head not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom and testified surprise at sight of me and the fire
to whom i imparted how my uncle had come in the night and was then asleep and how the breakfast preparations were to be modified accordingly
then i washed and dressed while they knocked the furniture about and made a dust and so in a sort of dream or sleep waking i found myself sitting by the fire again waiting for him to come to breakfast
by and by his door opened and he came out
i could not bring myself to bear the sight of him and i thought he had a worse look by daylight
i do not even know said i speaking low as he took his seat at the table by what name to call you
i have given out that you are my uncle
that s it dear boy
call me uncle
you assumed some name i suppose on board ship
yes dear boy
i took the name of provis
do you mean to keep that name
why yes dear boy it s as good as another unless you d like another
what is your real name
i asked him in a whisper
magwitch he answered in the same tone chrisen d abel
what were you brought up to be
a warmint dear boy
he answered quite seriously and used the word as if it denoted some profession
when you came into the temple last night said i pausing to wonder whether that could really have been last night which seemed so long ago
yes dear boy
when you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here had you any one with you
with me
no dear boy
but there was some one there
i didn t take particular notice he said dubiously not knowing the ways of the place
but i think there was a person too come in alonger me
are you known in london
i hope not
said he giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that made me turn hot and sick
were you known in london once
not over and above dear boy
i was in the provinces mostly
were you tried in london
which time
said he with a sharp look
the last time
he nodded
first knowed mr jaggers that way
jaggers was for me
it was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for but he took up a knife gave it a flourish and with the words and what i done is worked out and paid for
fell to at his breakfast
he ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable and all his actions were uncouth noisy and greedy
some of his teeth had failed him since i saw him eat on the marshes and as he turned his food in his mouth and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to bear upon it he looked terribly like a hungry old dog
if i had begun with any appetite he would have taken it away and i should have sat much as i did repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion and gloomily looking at the cloth
i m a heavy grubber dear boy he said as a polite kind of apology when he made an end of his meal but i always was
if it had been in my constitution to be a lighter grubber i might ha got into lighter trouble
similarly i must have my smoke
when i was first hired out as shepherd t other side the world it s my belief i should ha turned into a molloncolly mad sheep myself if i hadn t a had my smoke
as he said so he got up from table and putting his hand into the breast of the pea coat he wore brought out a short black pipe and a handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called negro head
having filled his pipe he put the surplus tobacco back again as if his pocket were a drawer
then he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs and lighted his pipe at it and then turned round on the hearth rug with his back to the fire and went through his favorite action of holding out both his hands for mine
and this said he dandling my hands up and down in his as he puffed at his pipe and this is the gentleman what i made
the real genuine one
it does me good fur to look at you pip
all i stip late is to stand by and look at you dear boy
i released my hands as soon as i could and found that i was beginning slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition
what i was chained to and how heavily became intelligible to me as i heard his hoarse voice and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron gray hair at the sides
i mustn t see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets there mustn t be no mud on his boots
my gentleman must have horses pip
horses to ride and horses to drive and horses for his servant to ride and drive as well
shall colonists have their horses and blood uns if you please good lord
and not my london gentleman
no no
we ll show em another pair of shoes than that pip won t us
he took out of his pocket a great thick pocket book bursting with papers and tossed it on the table
there s something worth spending in that there book dear boy
it s yourn
all i ve got ain t mine it s yourn
don t you be afeerd on it
there s more where that come from
i ve come to the old country fur to see my gentleman spend his money like a gentleman
that ll be my pleasure
my pleasure ull be fur to see him do it
and blast you all
he wound up looking round the room and snapping his fingers once with a loud snap blast you every one from the judge in his wig to the colonist a stirring up the dust i ll show a better gentleman than the whole kit on you put together
stop
said i almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike i want to speak to you
i want to know what is to be done
i want to know how you are to be kept out of danger how long you are going to stay what projects you have
look ee here pip said he laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly altered and subdued manner first of all look ee here
i forgot myself half a minute ago
what i said was low that s what it was low
look ee here pip
look over it
i ain t a going to be low
first i resumed half groaning what precautions can be taken against your being recognized and seized
no dear boy he said in the same tone as before that don t go first
lowness goes first
i ain t took so many year to make a gentleman not without knowing what s due to him
look ee here pip
i was low that s what i was low
look over it dear boy
some sense of the grimly ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh as i replied i have looked over it
in heaven s name don t harp upon it
yes but look ee here he persisted
dear boy i ain t come so fur not fur to be low
now go on dear boy
you was a saying how are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred
well dear boy the danger ain t so great
without i was informed agen the danger ain t so much to signify
there s jaggers and there s wemmick and there s you
who else is there to inform
is there no chance person who might identify you in the street
said i
well he returned there ain t many
nor yet i don t intend to advertise myself in the newspapers by the name of a m come back from botany bay and years have rolled away and who s to gain by it
still look ee here pip
if the danger had been fifty times as great i should ha come to see you mind you just the same
and how long do you remain
how long
said he taking his black pipe from his mouth and dropping his jaw as he stared at me
i m not a going back
i ve come for good
where are you to live
said i
what is to be done with you
where will you be safe
dear boy he returned there s disguising wigs can be bought for money and there s hair powder and spectacles and black clothes shorts and what not
others has done it safe afore and what others has done afore others can do agen
as to the where and how of living dear boy give me your own opinions on it
you take it smoothly now said i but you were very serious last night when you swore it was death
and so i swear it is death said he putting his pipe back in his mouth and death by the rope in the open street not fur from this and it s serious that you should fully understand it to be so
what then when that s once done
here i am
to go back now ud be as bad as to stand ground worse
besides pip i m here because i ve meant it by you years and years
as to what i dare i m a old bird now as has dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged and i m not afeerd to perch upon a scarecrow
if there s death hid inside of it there is and let him come out and i ll face him and then i ll believe in him and not afore
and now let me have a look at my gentleman agen
once more he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of admiring proprietorship smoking with great complacency all the while
it appeared to me that i could do no better than secure him some quiet lodging hard by of which he might take possession when herbert returned whom i expected in two or three days
that the secret must be confided to herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity even if i could have put the immense relief i should derive from sharing it with him out of the question was plain to me
but it was by no means so plain to mr provis i resolved to call him by that name who reserved his consent to herbert s participation until he should have seen him and formed a favorable judgment of his physiognomy
and even then dear boy said he pulling a greasy little clasped black testament out of his pocket we ll have him on his oath
to state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency would be to state what i never quite established but this i can say that i never knew him put it to any other use
the book itself had the appearance of having been stolen from some court of justice and perhaps his knowledge of its antecedents combined with his own experience in that wise gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm
on this first occasion of his producing it i recalled how he had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago and how he had described himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude
as he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit in which he looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of i next discussed with him what dress he should wear
he cherished an extraordinary belief in the virtues of shorts as a disguise and had in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him something between a dean and a dentist
it was with considerable difficulty that i won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a prosperous farmer s and we arranged that he should cut his hair close and wear a little powder
lastly as he had not yet been seen by the laundress or her niece he was to keep himself out of their view until his change of dress was made
it would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions but in my dazed not to say distracted state it took so long that i did not get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon
he was to remain shut up in the chambers while i was gone and was on no account to open the door
there being to my knowledge a respectable lodging house in essex street the back of which looked into the temple and was almost within hail of my windows i first of all repaired to that house and was so fortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle mr provis
i then went from shop to shop making such purchases as were necessary to the change in his appearance
this business transacted i turned my face on my own account to little britain
mr jaggers was at his desk but seeing me enter got up immediately and stood before his fire
now pip said he be careful
i will sir i returned
for coming along i had thought well of what i was going to say
don t commit yourself said mr jaggers and don t commit any one
you understand any one
don t tell me anything i don t want to know anything i am not curious
of course i saw that he knew the man was come
i merely want mr jaggers said i to assure myself that what i have been told is true
i have no hope of its being untrue but at least i may verify it
mr jaggers nodded
but did you say told or informed
he asked me with his head on one side and not looking at me but looking in a listening way at the floor
told would seem to imply verbal communication
you can t have verbal communication with a man in new south wales you know
i will say informed mr
jaggers
good
i have been informed by a person named abel magwitch that he is the benefactor so long unknown to me
that is the man said mr jaggers in new south wales
and only he
said i
and only he said mr jaggers
i am not so unreasonable sir as to think you at all responsible for my mistakes and wrong conclusions but i always supposed it was miss havisham
as you say pip returned mr jaggers turning his eyes upon me coolly and taking a bite at his forefinger i am not at all responsible for that
and yet it looked so like it sir i pleaded with a downcast heart
not a particle of evidence pip said mr jaggers shaking his head and gathering up his skirts
take nothing on its looks take everything on evidence
there s no better rule
i have no more to say said i with a sigh after standing silent for a little while
i have verified my information and there s an end
and magwitch in new south wales having at last disclosed himself said mr jaggers you will comprehend pip how rigidly throughout my communication with you i have always adhered to the strict line of fact
there has never been the least departure from the strict line of fact
you are quite aware of that
quite sir
i communicated to magwitch in new south wales when he first wrote to me from new south wales the caution that he must not expect me ever to deviate from the strict line of fact
i also communicated to him another caution
he appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in england here
i cautioned him that i must hear no more of that that he was not at all likely to obtain a pardon that he was expatriated for the term of his natural life and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of felony rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law
i gave magwitch that caution said mr jaggers looking hard at me i wrote it to new south wales
he guided himself by it no doubt
no doubt said i
i have been informed by wemmick pursued mr jaggers still looking hard at me that he has received a letter under date portsmouth from a colonist of the name of purvis or or provis i suggested
or provis thank you pip
perhaps it is provis
perhaps you know it s provis
yes said i
you know it s provis
a letter under date portsmouth from a colonist of the name of provis asking for the particulars of your address on behalf of magwitch
wemmick sent him the particulars i understand by return of post
probably it is through provis that you have received the explanation of magwitch in new south wales
it came through provis i replied
good day pip said mr jaggers offering his hand glad to have seen you
in writing by post to magwitch in new south wales or in communicating with him through provis have the goodness to mention that the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you together with the balance for there is still a balance remaining
good day pip
we shook hands and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me
i turned at the door and he was still looking hard at me while the two vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open and to force out of their swollen throats o what a man he is
wemmick was out and though he had been at his desk he could have done nothing for me
i went straight back to the temple where i found the terrible provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro head in safety
next day the clothes i had ordered all came home and he put them on
whatever he put on became him less it dismally seemed to me than what he had worn before
to my thinking there was something in him that made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him
the more i dressed him and the better i dressed him the more he looked like the slouching fugitive on the marshes
this effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable no doubt to his old face and manner growing more familiar to me but i believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there were still a weight of iron on it and that from head to foot there was convict in the very grain of the man
the influences of his solitary hut life were upon him besides and gave him a savage air that no dress could tame added to these were the influences of his subsequent branded life among men and crowning all his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now
in all his ways of sitting and standing and eating and drinking of brooding about in a high shouldered reluctant style of taking out his great horn handled jackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food of lifting light glasses and cups to his lips as if they were clumsy pannikins of chopping a wedge off his bread and soaking up with it the last fragments of gravy round and round his plate as if to make the most of an allowance and then drying his finger ends on it and then swallowing it in these ways and a thousand other small nameless instances arising every minute in the day there was prisoner felon bondsman plain as plain could be
it had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder and i had conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts
but i can compare the effect of it when on to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon the dead so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it was most desirable to repress started through that thin layer of pretence and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head
it was abandoned as soon as tried and he wore his grizzled hair cut short
words cannot tell what a sense i had at the same time of the dreadful mystery that he was to me
when he fell asleep of an evening with his knotted hands clenching the sides of the easy chair and his bald head tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast i would sit and look at him wondering what he had done and loading him with all the crimes in the calendar until the impulse was powerful on me to start up and fly from him
every hour so increased my abhorrence of him that i even think i might have yielded to this impulse in the first agonies of being so haunted notwithstanding all he had done for me and the risk he ran but for the knowledge that herbert must soon come back
once i actually did start out of bed in the night and begin to dress myself in my worst clothes hurriedly intending to leave him there with everything else i possessed and enlist for india as a private soldier
i doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me up in those lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights with the wind and the rain always rushing by
a ghost could not have been taken and hanged on my account and the consideration that he could be and the dread that he would be were no small addition to my horrors
when he was not asleep or playing a complicated kind of patience with a ragged pack of cards of his own a game that i never saw before or since and in which he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the table when he was not engaged in either of these pursuits he would ask me to read to him foreign language dear boy
while i complied he not comprehending a single word would stand before the fire surveying me with the air of an exhibitor and i would see him between the fingers of the hand with which i shaded my face appealing in dumb show to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency
the imaginary student pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made was not more wretched than i pursued by the creature who had made me and recoiling from him with a stronger repulsion the more he admired me and the fonder he was of me
this is written of i am sensible as if it had lasted a year
it lasted about five days
expecting herbert all the time i dared not go out except when i took provis for an airing after dark
at length one evening when dinner was over and i had dropped into a slumber quite worn out for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful dreams i was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase
provis who had been asleep too staggered up at the noise i made and in an instant i saw his jackknife shining in his hand
quiet
it s herbert
i said and herbert came bursting in with the airy freshness of six hundred miles of france upon him
handel my dear fellow how are you and again how are you and again how are you
i seem to have been gone a twelvemonth
why so i must have been for you have grown quite thin and pale
handel my halloa
i beg your pardon
he was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me by seeing provis
provis regarding him with a fixed attention was slowly putting up his jackknife and groping in another pocket for something else
herbert my dear friend said i shutting the double doors while herbert stood staring and wondering something very strange has happened
this is a visitor of mine
it s all right dear boy
said provis coming forward with his little clasped black book and then addressing himself to herbert
take it in your right hand
lord strike you dead on the spot if ever you split in any way sumever
kiss it
do so as he wishes it i said to herbert
so herbert looking at me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement complied and provis immediately shaking hands with him said now you re on your oath you know
and never believe me on mine if pip shan t make a gentleman on you
chapter xli in vain should i attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of herbert when he and i and provis sat down before the fire and i recounted the whole of the secret
enough that i saw my own feelings reflected in herbert s face and not least among them my repugnance towards the man who had done so much for me
what would alone have set a division between that man and us if there had been no other dividing circumstance was his triumph in my story
saving his troublesome sense of having been low on one occasion since his return on which point he began to hold forth to herbert the moment my revelation was finished he had no perception of the possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune
his boast that he had made me a gentleman and that he had come to see me support the character on his ample resources was made for me quite as much as for himself
and that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us and that we must both be very proud of it was a conclusion quite established in his own mind
though look ee here pip s comrade he said to herbert after having discoursed for some time i know very well that once since i come back for half a minute i ve been low
i said to pip i knowed as i had been low
but don t you fret yourself on that score
i ain t made pip a gentleman and pip ain t a going to make you a gentleman not fur me not to know what s due to ye both
dear boy and pip s comrade you two may count upon me always having a gen teel muzzle on
muzzled i have been since that half a minute when i was betrayed into lowness muzzled i am at the present time muzzled i ever will be
herbert said certainly but looked as if there were no specific consolation in this and remained perplexed and dismayed
we were anxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us together but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together and sat late
it was midnight before i took him round to essex street and saw him safely in at his own dark door
when it closed upon him i experienced the first moment of relief i had known since the night of his arrival
never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs i had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark and in bringing him back and i looked about me now
difficult as it is in a large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched when the mind is conscious of danger in that regard i could not persuade myself that any of the people within sight cared about my movements
the few who were passing passed on their several ways and the street was empty when i turned back into the temple
nobody had come out at the gate with us nobody went in at the gate with me
as i crossed by the fountain i saw his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet and when i stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where i lived before going up the stairs garden court was as still and lifeless as the staircase was when i ascended it
herbert received me with open arms and i had never felt before so blessedly what it is to have a friend
when he had spoken some sound words of sympathy and encouragement we sat down to consider the question what was to be done
the chair that provis had occupied still remaining where it had stood for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot in one unsettled manner and going through one round of observances with his pipe and his negro head and his jackknife and his pack of cards and what not as if it were all put down for him on a slate i say his chair remaining where it had stood herbert unconsciously took it but next moment started out of it pushed it away and took another
he had no occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my patron neither had i occasion to confess my own
we interchanged that confidence without shaping a syllable
what said i to herbert when he was safe in another chair what is to be done
my poor dear handel he replied holding his head i am too stunned to think
so was i herbert when the blow first fell
still something must be done
he is intent upon various new expenses horses and carriages and lavish appearances of all kinds
he must be stopped somehow
you mean that you can t accept how can i
i interposed as herbert paused
think of him
look at him
an involuntary shudder passed over both of us
yet i am afraid the dreadful truth is herbert that he is attached to me strongly attached to me
was there ever such a fate
my poor dear handel herbert repeated
then said i after all stopping short here never taking another penny from him think what i owe him already
then again i am heavily in debt very heavily for me who have now no expectations and i have been bred to no calling and i am fit for nothing
well well well
herbert remonstrated
don t say fit for nothing
what am i fit for
i know only one thing that i am fit for and that is to go for a soldier
and i might have gone my dear herbert but for the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection
of course i broke down there and of course herbert beyond seizing a warm grip of my hand pretended not to know it
anyhow my dear handel said he presently soldiering won t do
if you were to renounce this patronage and these favors i suppose you would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have already had
not very strong that hope if you went soldiering
besides it s absurd
you would be infinitely better in clarriker s house small as it is
i am working up towards a partnership you know
poor fellow
he little suspected with whose money
but there is another question said herbert
this is an ignorant determined man who has long had one fixed idea
more than that he seems to me i may misjudge him to be a man of a desperate and fierce character
i know he is i returned
let me tell you what evidence i have seen of it
and i told him what i had not mentioned in my narrative of that encounter with the other convict
see then said herbert think of this
he comes here at the peril of his life for the realization of his fixed idea
in the moment of realization after all his toil and waiting you cut the ground from under his feet destroy his idea and make his gains worthless to him
do you see nothing that he might do under the disappointment
i have seen it herbert and dreamed of it ever since the fatal night of his arrival
nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his putting himself in the way of being taken
then you may rely upon it said herbert that there would be great danger of his doing it
that is his power over you as long as he remains in england and that would be his reckless course if you forsook him
i was so struck by the horror of this idea which had weighed upon me from the first and the working out of which would make me regard myself in some sort as his murderer that i could not rest in my chair but began pacing to and fro
i said to herbert meanwhile that even if provis were recognized and taken in spite of himself i should be wretched as the cause however innocently
yes even though i was so wretched in having him at large and near me and even though i would far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than i would ever have come to this
but there was no staving off the question what was to be done
the first and the main thing to be done said herbert is to get him out of england
you will have to go with him and then he may be induced to go
but get him where i will could i prevent his coming back
my good handel is it not obvious that with newgate in the next street there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him and making him reckless here than elsewhere
if a pretext to get him away could be made out of that other convict or out of anything else in his life now
there again
said i stopping before herbert with my open hands held out as if they contained the desperation of the case
i know nothing of his life
it has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see him before me so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes and yet so unknown to me except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days in my childhood
herbert got up and linked his arm in mine and we slowly walked to and fro together studying the carpet
handel said herbert stopping you feel convinced that you can take no further benefits from him do you
fully
surely you would too if you were in my place
and you feel convinced that you must break with him
herbert can you ask me
and you have and are bound to have that tenderness for the life he has risked on your account that you must save him if possible from throwing it away
then you must get him out of england before you stir a finger to extricate yourself
that done extricate yourself in heaven s name and we ll see it out together dear old boy
it was a comfort to shake hands upon it and walk up and down again with only that done
now herbert said i with reference to gaining some knowledge of his history
there is but one way that i know of
i must ask him point blank
yes
ask him said herbert when we sit at breakfast in the morning
for he had said on taking leave of herbert that he would come to breakfast with us
with this project formed we went to bed
i had the wildest dreams concerning him and woke unrefreshed i woke too to recover the fear which i had lost in the night of his being found out as a returned transport
waking i never lost that fear
he came round at the appointed time took out his jackknife and sat down to his meal
he was full of plans for his gentleman s coming out strong and like a gentleman and urged me to begin speedily upon the pocket book which he had left in my possession
he considered the chambers and his own lodging as temporary residences and advised me to look out at once for a fashionable crib near hyde park in which he could have a shake down
when he had made an end of his breakfast and was wiping his knife on his leg i said to him without a word of preface after you were gone last night i told my friend of the struggle that the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes when we came up
you remember
remember
said he
i think so
we want to know something about that man and about you
it is strange to know no more about either and particularly you than i was able to tell last night
is not this as good a time as another for our knowing more
well
he said after consideration
you re on your oath you know pip s comrade
assuredly replied herbert
as to anything i say you know he insisted
the oath applies to all
i understand it to do so
and look ee here
wotever i done is worked out and paid for he insisted again
so be it
he took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negro head when looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand he seemed to think it might perplex the thread of his narrative
he put it back again stuck his pipe in a button hole of his coat spread a hand on each knee and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments looked round at us and said what follows
chapter xlii dear boy and pip s comrade
i am not a going fur to tell you my life like a song or a story book
but to give it you short and handy i ll put it at once into a mouthful of english
in jail and out of jail in jail and out of jail in jail and out of jail
there you ve got it
that s my life pretty much down to such times as i got shipped off arter pip stood my friend
i ve been done everything to pretty well except hanged
i ve been locked up as much as a silver tea kittle
i ve been carted here and carted there and put out of this town and put out of that town and stuck in the stocks and whipped and worried and drove
i ve no more notion where i was born than you have if so much
i first become aware of myself down in essex a thieving turnips for my living
summun had run away from me a man a tinker and he d took the fire with him and left me wery cold
i know d my name to be magwitch chrisen d abel
how did i know it
much as i know d the birds names in the hedges to be chaffinch sparrer thrush
i might have thought it was all lies together only as the birds names come out true i supposed mine did
so fur as i could find there warn t a soul that see young abel magwitch with us little on him as in him but wot caught fright at him and either drove him off or took him up
i was took up took up took up to that extent that i reg larly grow d up took up
this is the way it was that when i was a ragged little creetur as much to be pitied as ever i see not that i looked in the glass for there warn t many insides of furnished houses known to me i got the name of being hardened
this is a terrible hardened one they says to prison wisitors picking out me
may be said to live in jails this boy
then they looked at me and i looked at them and they measured my head some on em they had better a measured my stomach and others on em giv me tracts what i couldn t read and made me speeches what i couldn t understand
they always went on agen me about the devil
but what the devil was i to do
i must put something into my stomach mustn t i howsomever i m a getting low and i know what s due
dear boy and pip s comrade don t you be afeerd of me being low
tramping begging thieving working sometimes when i could though that warn t as often as you may think till you put the question whether you would ha been over ready to give me work yourselves a bit of a poacher a bit of a laborer a bit of a wagoner a bit of a haymaker a bit of a hawker a bit of most things that don t pay and lead to trouble i got to be a man
a deserting soldier in a traveller s rest what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs learnt me to read and a travelling giant what signed his name at a penny a time learnt me to write
i warn t locked up as often now as formerly but i wore out my good share of key metal still
at epsom races a matter of over twenty years ago i got acquainted wi a man whose skull i d crack wi this poker like the claw of a lobster if i d got it on this hob
his right name was compeyson and that s the man dear boy what you see me a pounding in the ditch according to what you truly told your comrade arter i was gone last night
he set up fur a gentleman this compeyson and he d been to a public boarding school and had learning
he was a smooth one to talk and was a dab at the ways of gentlefolks
he was good looking too
it was the night afore the great race when i found him on the heath in a booth that i know d on
him and some more was a sitting among the tables when i went in and the landlord which had a knowledge of me and was a sporting one called him out and said i think this is a man that might suit you meaning i was
compeyson he looks at me very noticing and i look at him
he has a watch and a chain and a ring and a breast pin and a handsome suit of clothes
to judge from appearances you re out of luck says compeyson to me
yes master and i ve never been in it much
i had come out of kingston jail last on a vagrancy committal
not but what it might have been for something else but it warn t
luck changes says compeyson perhaps yours is going to change
i says i hope it may be so
there s room
what can you do
says compeyson
eat and drink i says if you ll find the materials
compeyson laughed looked at me again very noticing giv me five shillings and appointed me for next night
same place
i went to compeyson next night same place and compeyson took me on to be his man and pardner
and what was compeyson s business in which we was to go pardners
compeyson s business was the swindling handwriting forging stolen bank note passing and such like
all sorts of traps as compeyson could set with his head and keep his own legs out of and get the profits from and let another man in for was compeyson s business
he d no more heart than a iron file he was as cold as death and he had the head of the devil afore mentioned
there was another in with compeyson as was called arthur not as being so chrisen d but as a surname
he was in a decline and was a shadow to look at
him and compeyson had been in a bad thing with a rich lady some years afore and they d made a pot of money by it but compeyson betted and gamed and he d have run through the king s taxes
so arthur was a dying and a dying poor and with the horrors on him and compeyson s wife which compeyson kicked mostly was a having pity on him when she could and compeyson was a having pity on nothing and nobody
i might a took warning by arthur but i didn t and i won t pretend i was partick ler for where ud be the good on it dear boy and comrade
so i begun wi compeyson and a poor tool i was in his hands
arthur lived at the top of compeyson s house over nigh brentford it was and compeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging in case he should ever get better to work it out
but arthur soon settled the account
the second or third time as ever i see him he come a tearing down into compeyson s parlor late at night in only a flannel gown with his hair all in a sweat and he says to compeyson s wife sally she really is upstairs alonger me now and i can t get rid of her
she s all in white he says wi white flowers in her hair and she s awful mad and she s got a shroud hanging over her arm and she says she ll put it on me at five in the morning
says compeyson why you fool don t you know she s got a living body
and how should she be up there without coming through the door or in at the window and up the stairs
i don t know how she s there says arthur shivering dreadful with the horrors but she s standing in the corner at the foot of the bed awful mad
and over where her heart s broke you broke it there s drops of blood
compeyson spoke hardy but he was always a coward
go up alonger this drivelling sick man he says to his wife and magwitch lend her a hand will you
but he never come nigh himself
compeyson s wife and me took him up to bed agen and he raved most dreadful
why look at her
he cries out
she s a shaking the shroud at me
don t you see her
look at her eyes
ain t it awful to see her so mad
next he cries she ll put it on me and then i m done for
take it away from her take it away
and then he catched hold of us and kep on a talking to her and answering of her till i half believed i see her myself
compeyson s wife being used to him giv him some liquor to get the horrors off and by and by he quieted
o she s gone
has her keeper been for her
he says
yes says compeyson s wife
did you tell him to lock her and bar her in
yes
and to take that ugly thing away from her
yes yes all right
you re a good creetur he says don t leave me whatever you do and thank you
he rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five and then he starts up with a scream and screams out here she is
she s got the shroud again
she s unfolding it
she s coming out of the corner
she s coming to the bed
hold me both on you one of each side don t let her touch me with it
hah
she missed me that time
don t let her throw it over my shoulders
don t let her lift me up to get it round me
she s lifting me up
keep me down
then he lifted himself up hard and was dead
compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides
him and me was soon busy and first he swore me being ever artful on my own book this here little black book dear boy what i swore your comrade on
not to go into the things that compeyson planned and i done which ud take a week i ll simply say to you dear boy and pip s comrade that that man got me into such nets as made me his black slave
i was always in debt to him always under his thumb always a working always a getting into danger
he was younger than me but he d got craft and he d got learning and he overmatched me five hundred times told and no mercy
my missis as i had the hard time wi stop though
i ain t brought her in he looked about him in a confused way as if he had lost his place in the book of his remembrance and he turned his face to the fire and spread his hands broader on his knees and lifted them off and put them on again
there ain t no need to go into it he said looking round once more
the time wi compeyson was a most as hard a time as ever i had that said all s said
did i tell you as i was tried alone for misdemeanor while with compeyson
i answered no
well
he said i was and got convicted
as to took up on suspicion that was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted but evidence was wanting
at last me and compeyson was both committed for felony on a charge of putting stolen notes in circulation and there was other charges behind
compeyson says to me separate defences no communication and that was all
and i was so miserable poor that i sold all the clothes i had except what hung on my back afore i could get jaggers
when we was put in the dock i noticed first of all what a gentleman compeyson looked wi his curly hair and his black clothes and his white pocket handkercher and what a common sort of a wretch i looked
when the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short aforehand i noticed how heavy it all bore on me and how light on him
when the evidence was giv in the box i noticed how it was always me that had come for ard and could be swore to how it was always me that the money had been paid to how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing and get the profit
but when the defence come on then i see the plan plainer for says the counsellor for compeyson my lord and gentlemen here you has afore you side by side two persons as your eyes can separate wide one the younger well brought up who will be spoke to as such one the elder ill brought up who will be spoke to as such one the younger seldom if ever seen in these here transactions and only suspected t other the elder always seen in em and always wi his guilt brought home
can you doubt if there is but one in it which is the one and if there is two in it which is much the worst one
and such like
and when it come to character warn t it compeyson as had been to the school and warn t it his schoolfellows as was in this position and in that and warn t it him as had been know d by witnesses in such clubs and societies and nowt to his disadvantage
and warn t it me as had been tried afore and as had been know d up hill and down dale in bridewells and lock ups
and when it come to speech making warn t it compeyson as could speak to em wi his face dropping every now and then into his white pocket handkercher ah
and wi verses in his speech too and warn t it me as could only say gentlemen this man at my side is a most precious rascal
and when the verdict come warn t it compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company and giving up all the information he could agen me and warn t it me as got never a word but guilty
and when i says to compeyson once out of this court i ll smash that face of yourn
ain t it compeyson as prays the judge to be protected and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us
and when we re sentenced ain t it him as gets seven year and me fourteen and ain t it him as the judge is sorry for because he might a done so well and ain t it me as the judge perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion likely to come to worse
he had worked himself into a state of great excitement but he checked it took two or three short breaths swallowed as often and stretching out his hand towards me said in a reassuring manner i ain t a going to be low dear boy
he had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and head and neck and hands before he could go on
i had said to compeyson that i d smash that face of his and i swore lord smash mine
to do it
we was in the same prison ship but i couldn t get at him for long though i tried
at last i come behind him and hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at him when i was seen and seized
the black hole of that ship warn t a strong one to a judge of black holes that could swim and dive
i escaped to the shore and i was a hiding among the graves there envying them as was in em and all over when i first see my boy
he regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent to me again though i had felt great pity for him
by my boy i was giv to understand as compeyson was out on them marshes too
upon my soul i half believe he escaped in his terror to get quit of me not knowing it was me as had got ashore
i hunted him down
i smashed his face
and now says i as the worst thing i can do caring nothing for myself i ll drag you back
and i d have swum off towing him by the hair if it had come to that and i d a got him aboard without the soldiers
of course he d much the best of it to the last his character was so good
he had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous intentions and his punishment was light
i was put in irons brought to trial again and sent for life
i didn t stop for life dear boy and pip s comrade being here
he wiped himself again as he had done before and then slowly took his tangle of tobacco from his pocket and plucked his pipe from his button hole and slowly filled it and began to smoke
is he dead
i asked after a silence
is who dead dear boy
compeyson
he hopes i am if he s alive you may be sure with a fierce look
i never heerd no more of him
herbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book
he softly pushed the book over to me as provis stood smoking with his eyes on the fire and i read in it young havisham s name was arthur
compeyson is the man who professed to be miss havisham s lover
i shut the book and nodded slightly to herbert and put the book by but we neither of us said anything and both looked at provis as he stood smoking by the fire
chapter xliii why should i pause to ask how much of my shrinking from provis might be traced to estella
why should i loiter on my road to compare the state of mind in which i had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison before meeting her at the coach office with the state of mind in which i now reflected on the abyss between estella in her pride and beauty and the returned transport whom i harbored
the road would be none the smoother for it the end would be none the better for it he would not be helped nor i extenuated
a new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative or rather his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already there
if compeyson were alive and should discover his return i could hardly doubt the consequence
that compeyson stood in mortal fear of him neither of the two could know much better than i and that any such man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release himself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an informer was scarcely to be imagined
never had i breathed and never would i breathe or so i resolved a word of estella to provis
but i said to herbert that before i could go abroad i must see both estella and miss havisham
this was when we were left alone on the night of the day when provis told us his story
i resolved to go out to richmond next day and i went
on my presenting myself at mrs brandley s estella s maid was called to tell that estella had gone into the country
where
to satis house as usual
not as usual i said for she had never yet gone there without me when was she coming back
there was an air of reservation in the answer which increased my perplexity and the answer was that her maid believed she was only coming back at all for a little while
i could make nothing of this except that it was meant that i should make nothing of it and i went home again in complete discomfiture
another night consultation with herbert after provis was gone home i always took him home and always looked well about me led us to the conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until i came back from miss havisham s
in the mean time herbert and i were to consider separately what it would be best to say whether we should devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious observation or whether i who had never yet been abroad should propose an expedition
we both knew that i had but to propose anything and he would consent
we agreed that his remaining many days in his present hazard was not to be thought of
next day i had the meanness to feign that i was under a binding promise to go down to joe but i was capable of almost any meanness towards joe or his name
provis was to be strictly careful while i was gone and herbert was to take the charge of him that i had taken
i was to be absent only one night and on my return the gratification of his impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be begun
it occurred to me then and as i afterwards found to herbert also that he might be best got away across the water on that pretence as to make purchases or the like
having thus cleared the way for my expedition to miss havisham s i set off by the early morning coach before it was yet light and was out on the open country road when the day came creeping on halting and whimpering and shivering and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of mist like a beggar
when we drove up to the blue boar after a drizzly ride whom should i see come out under the gateway toothpick in hand to look at the coach but bentley drummle
as he pretended not to see me i pretended not to see him
it was a very lame pretence on both sides the lamer because we both went into the coffee room where he had just finished his breakfast and where i ordered mine
it was poisonous to me to see him in the town for i very well knew why he had come there
pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date which had nothing half so legible in its local news as the foreign matter of coffee pickles fish sauces gravy melted butter and wine with which it was sprinkled all over as if it had taken the measles in a highly irregular form i sat at my table while he stood before the fire
by degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the fire
and i got up determined to have my share of it
i had to put my hand behind his legs for the poker when i went up to the fireplace to stir the fire but still pretended not to know him
is this a cut
said mr drummle
oh
said i poker in hand it s you is it
how do you do
i was wondering who it was who kept the fire off
with that i poked tremendously and having done so planted myself side by side with mr drummle my shoulders squared and my back to the fire
you have just come down
said mr drummle edging me a little away with his shoulder
yes said i edging him a little away with my shoulder
beastly place said drummle
your part of the country i think
yes i assented
i am told it s very like your shropshire
not in the least like it said drummle
here mr drummle looked at his boots and i looked at mine and then mr drummle looked at my boots and i looked at his
have you been here long
i asked determined not to yield an inch of the fire
long enough to be tired of it returned drummle pretending to yawn but equally determined
do you stay here long
can t say answered mr drummle
do you
can t say said i i felt here through a tingling in my blood that if mr drummle s shoulder had claimed another hair s breadth of room i should have jerked him into the window equally that if my own shoulder had urged a similar claim mr drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box
he whistled a little
so did i
large tract of marshes about here i believe
said drummle
yes
what of that
said i mr drummle looked at me and then at my boots and then said oh
and laughed
are you amused mr
drummle
no said he not particularly
i am going out for a ride in the saddle
i mean to explore those marshes for amusement
out of the way villages there they tell me
curious little public houses and smithies and that
waiter
yes sir
is that horse of mine ready
brought round to the door sir
i say
look here you sir
the lady won t ride to day the weather won t do
very good sir
and i don t dine because i m going to dine at the lady s
very good sir
then drummle glanced at me with an insolent triumph on his great jowled face that cut me to the heart dull as he was and so exasperated me that i felt inclined to take him in my arms as the robber in the story book is said to have taken the old lady and seat him on the fire
one thing was manifest to both of us and that was that until relief came neither of us could relinquish the fire
there we stood well squared up before it shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot with our hands behind us not budging an inch
the horse was visible outside in the drizzle at the door my breakfast was put on the table drummle s was cleared away the waiter invited me to begin i nodded we both stood our ground
have you been to the grove since
said drummle
no said i i had quite enough of the finches the last time i was there
was that when we had a difference of opinion
yes i replied very shortly
come come
they let you off easily enough sneered drummle
you shouldn t have lost your temper
mr drummle said i you are not competent to give advice on that subject
when i lose my temper not that i admit having done so on that occasion i don t throw glasses
i do said drummle
after glancing at him once or twice in an increased state of smouldering ferocity i said mr drummle i did not seek this conversation and i don t think it an agreeable one
i am sure it s not said he superciliously over his shoulder i don t think anything about it
and therefore i went on with your leave i will suggest that we hold no kind of communication in future
quite my opinion said drummle and what i should have suggested myself or done more likely without suggesting
but don t lose your temper
haven t you lost enough without that
what do you mean sir
waiter
said drummle by way of answering me
the waiter reappeared
look here you sir
you quite understand that the young lady don t ride to day and that i dine at the young lady s
quite so sir
when the waiter had felt my fast cooling teapot with the palm of his hand and had looked imploringly at me and had gone out drummle careful not to move the shoulder next me took a cigar from his pocket and bit the end off but showed no sign of stirring
choking and boiling as i was i felt that we could not go a word further without introducing estella s name which i could not endure to hear him utter and therefore i looked stonily at the opposite wall as if there were no one present and forced myself to silence
how long we might have remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say but for the incursion of three thriving farmers laid on by the waiter i think who came into the coffee room unbuttoning their great coats and rubbing their hands and before whom as they charged at the fire we were obliged to give way
i saw him through the window seizing his horse s mane and mounting in his blundering brutal manner and sidling and backing away
i thought he was gone when he came back calling for a light for the cigar in his mouth which he had forgotten
a man in a dust colored dress appeared with what was wanted i could not have said from where whether from the inn yard or the street or where not and as drummle leaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed with a jerk of his head towards the coffee room windows the slouching shoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards me reminded me of orlick
too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or no or after all to touch the breakfast i washed the weather and the journey from my face and hands and went out to the memorable old house that it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered never to have seen
chapter xliv in the room where the dressing table stood and where the wax candles burnt on the wall i found miss havisham and estella miss havisham seated on a settee near the fire and estella on a cushion at her feet
estella was knitting and miss havisham was looking on
they both raised their eyes as i went in and both saw an alteration in me
i derived that from the look they interchanged
and what wind said miss havisham blows you here pip
though she looked steadily at me i saw that she was rather confused
estella pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me and then going on i fancied that i read in the action of her fingers as plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet that she perceived i had discovered my real benefactor
miss havisham said i i went to richmond yesterday to speak to estella and finding that some wind had blown her here i followed
miss havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down i took the chair by the dressing table which i had often seen her occupy
with all that ruin at my feet and about me it seemed a natural place for me that day
what i had to say to estella miss havisham i will say before you presently in a few moments
it will not surprise you it will not displease you
i am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be
miss havisham continued to look steadily at me
i could see in the action of estella s fingers as they worked that she attended to what i said but she did not look up
i have found out who my patron is
it is not a fortunate discovery and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation station fortune anything
there are reasons why i must say no more of that
it is not my secret but another s
as i was silent for a while looking at estella and considering how to go on miss havisham repeated it is not your secret but another s
well
when you first caused me to be brought here miss havisham when i belonged to the village over yonder that i wish i had never left i suppose i did really come here as any other chance boy might have come as a kind of servant to gratify a want or a whim and to be paid for it
ay pip replied miss havisham steadily nodding her head you did
and that mr jaggers mr jaggers said miss havisham taking me up in a firm tone had nothing to do with it and knew nothing of it
his being my lawyer and his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence
he holds the same relation towards numbers of people and it might easily arise
be that as it may it did arise and was not brought about by any one
any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no suppression or evasion so far
but when i fell into the mistake i have so long remained in at least you led me on
said i
yes she returned again nodding steadily i let you go on
was that kind
who am i cried miss havisham striking her stick upon the floor and flashing into wrath so suddenly that estella glanced up at her in surprise who am i for god s sake that i should be kind
it was a weak complaint to have made and i had not meant to make it
i told her so as she sat brooding after this outburst
well well well
she said
what else
i was liberally paid for my old attendance here i said to soothe her in being apprenticed and i have asked these questions only for my own information
what follows has another and i hope more disinterested purpose
in humoring my mistake miss havisham you punished practised on perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses your intention without offence your self seeking relations
i did
why they would have it so
so would you
what has been my history that i should be at the pains of entreating either them or you not to have it so
you made your own snares
i never made them
waiting until she was quiet again for this too flashed out of her in a wild and sudden way i went on
i have been thrown among one family of your relations miss havisham and have been constantly among them since i went to london
i know them to have been as honestly under my delusion as i myself
and i should be false and base if i did not tell you whether it is acceptable to you or no and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no that you deeply wrong both mr matthew pocket and his son herbert if you suppose them to be otherwise than generous upright open and incapable of anything designing or mean
they are your friends said miss havisham
they made themselves my friends said i when they supposed me to have superseded them and when sarah pocket miss georgiana and mistress camilla were not my friends i think
this contrasting of them with the rest seemed i was glad to see to do them good with her
she looked at me keenly for a little while and then said quietly what do you want for them
only said i that you would not confound them with the others
they may be of the same blood but believe me they are not of the same nature
still looking at me keenly miss havisham repeated what do you want for them
i am not so cunning you see i said in answer conscious that i reddened a little as that i could hide from you even if i desired that i do want something
miss havisham if you would spare the money to do my friend herbert a lasting service in life but which from the nature of the case must be done without his knowledge i could show you how
why must it be done without his knowledge
she asked settling her hands upon her stick that she might regard me the more attentively
because said i i began the service myself more than two years ago without his knowledge and i don t want to be betrayed
why i fail in my ability to finish it i cannot explain
it is a part of the secret which is another person s and not mine
she gradually withdrew her eyes from me and turned them on the fire
after watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time she was roused by the collapse of some of the red coals and looked towards me again at first vacantly then with a gradually concentrating attention
all this time estella knitted on
when miss havisham had fixed her attention on me she said speaking as if there had been no lapse in our dialogue what else
estella said i turning to her now and trying to command my trembling voice you know i love you
you know that i have loved you long and dearly
she raised her eyes to my face on being thus addressed and her fingers plied their work and she looked at me with an unmoved countenance
i saw that miss havisham glanced from me to her and from her to me
i should have said this sooner but for my long mistake
it induced me to hope that miss havisham meant us for one another
while i thought you could not help yourself as it were i refrained from saying it
but i must say it now
preserving her unmoved countenance and with her fingers still going estella shook her head
i know said i in answer to that action i know
i have no hope that i shall ever call you mine estella
i am ignorant what may become of me very soon how poor i may be or where i may go
still i love you
i have loved you ever since i first saw you in this house
looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy she shook her head again
it would have been cruel in miss havisham horribly cruel to practise on the susceptibility of a poor boy and to torture me through all these years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit if she had reflected on the gravity of what she did
but i think she did not
i think that in the endurance of her own trial she forgot mine estella
i saw miss havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there as she sat looking by turns at estella and at me
it seems said estella very calmly that there are sentiments fancies i don t know how to call them which i am not able to comprehend
when you say you love me i know what you mean as a form of words but nothing more
you address nothing in my breast you touch nothing there
i don t care for what you say at all
i have tried to warn you of this now have i not
i said in a miserable manner yes
yes
but you would not be warned for you thought i did not mean it
now did you not think so
i thought and hoped you could not mean it
you so young untried and beautiful estella
surely it is not in nature
it is in my nature she returned
and then she added with a stress upon the words it is in the nature formed within me
i make a great difference between you and all other people when i say so much
i can do no more
is it not true said i that bentley drummle is in town here and pursuing you
it is quite true she replied referring to him with the indifference of utter contempt
that you encourage him and ride out with him and that he dines with you this very day
she seemed a little surprised that i should know it but again replied quite true
you cannot love him estella
her fingers stopped for the first time as she retorted rather angrily what have i told you
do you still think in spite of it that i do not mean what i say
you would never marry him estella
she looked towards miss havisham and considered for a moment with her work in her hands
then she said why not tell you the truth
i am going to be married to him
i dropped my face into my hands but was able to control myself better than i could have expected considering what agony it gave me to hear her say those words
when i raised my face again there was such a ghastly look upon miss havisham s that it impressed me even in my passionate hurry and grief
estella dearest estella do not let miss havisham lead you into this fatal step
put me aside for ever you have done so i well know but bestow yourself on some worthier person than drummle
miss havisham gives you to him as the greatest slight and injury that could be done to the many far better men who admire you and to the few who truly love you
among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly though he has not loved you as long as i
take him and i can bear it better for your sake
my earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have been touched with compassion if she could have rendered me at all intelligible to her own mind
i am going she said again in a gentler voice to be married to him
the preparations for my marriage are making and i shall be married soon
why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by adoption
it is my own act
your own act estella to fling yourself away upon a brute
on whom should i fling myself away
she retorted with a smile
should i fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel if people do feel such things that i took nothing to him
there
it is done
i shall do well enough and so will my husband
as to leading me into what you call this fatal step miss havisham would have had me wait and not marry yet but i am tired of the life i have led which has very few charms for me and i am willing enough to change it
say no more
we shall never understand each other
such a mean brute such a stupid brute
i urged in despair
don t be afraid of my being a blessing to him said estella i shall not be that
come
here is my hand
do we part on this you visionary boy or man
o estella
i answered as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand do what i would to restrain them even if i remained in england and could hold my head up with the rest how could i see you drummle s wife
nonsense she returned nonsense
this will pass in no time
never estella
you will get me out of your thoughts in a week
out of my thoughts
you are part of my existence part of myself
you have been in every line i have ever read since i first came here the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then
you have been in every prospect i have ever seen since on the river on the sails of the ships on the marshes in the clouds in the light in the darkness in the wind in the woods in the sea in the streets
you have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become acquainted with
the stones of which the strongest london buildings are made are not more real or more impossible to be displaced by your hands than your presence and influence have been to me there and everywhere and will be
estella to the last hour of my life you cannot choose but remain part of my character part of the little good in me part of the evil
but in this separation i associate you only with the good and i will faithfully hold you to that always for you must have done me far more good than harm let me feel now what sharp distress i may
o god bless you god forgive you
in what ecstasy of unhappiness i got these broken words out of myself i don t know
the rhapsody welled up within me like blood from an inward wound and gushed out
i held her hand to my lips some lingering moments and so i left her
but ever afterwards i remembered and soon afterwards with stronger reason that while estella looked at me merely with incredulous wonder the spectral figure of miss havisham her hand still covering her heart seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of pity and remorse
all done all gone
so much was done and gone that when i went out at the gate the light of the day seemed of a darker color than when i went in
for a while i hid myself among some lanes and by paths and then struck off to walk all the way to london
for i had by that time come to myself so far as to consider that i could not go back to the inn and see drummle there that i could not bear to sit upon the coach and be spoken to that i could do nothing half so good for myself as tire myself out
it was past midnight when i crossed london bridge
pursuing the narrow intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the middlesex shore of the river my readiest access to the temple was close by the river side through whitefriars
i was not expected till to morrow but i had my keys and if herbert were gone to bed could get to bed myself without disturbing him
as it seldom happened that i came in at that whitefriars gate after the temple was closed and as i was very muddy and weary i did not take it ill that the night porter examined me with much attention as he held the gate a little way open for me to pass in
to help his memory i mentioned my name
i was not quite sure sir but i thought so
here s a note sir
the messenger that brought it said would you be so good as read it by my lantern
much surprised by the request i took the note
it was directed to philip pip esquire and on the top of the superscription were the words please read this here
i opened it the watchman holding up his light and read inside in wemmick s writing don t go home
chapter xlv turning from the temple gate as soon as i had read the warning i made the best of my way to fleet street and there got a late hackney chariot and drove to the hummums in covent garden
in those times a bed was always to be got there at any hour of the night and the chamberlain letting me in at his ready wicket lighted the candle next in order on his shelf and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his list
it was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back with a despotic monster of a four post bedstead in it straddling over the whole place putting one of his arbitrary legs into the fireplace and another into the doorway and squeezing the wretched little washing stand in quite a divinely righteous manner
as i had asked for a night light the chamberlain had brought me in before he left me the good old constitutional rushlight of those virtuous days an object like the ghost of a walking cane which instantly broke its back if it were touched which nothing could ever be lighted at and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom of a high tin tower perforated with round holes that made a staringly wide awake pattern on the walls
when i had got into bed and lay there footsore weary and wretched i found that i could no more close my own eyes than i could close the eyes of this foolish argus
and thus in the gloom and death of the night we stared at one another
what a doleful night
how anxious how dismal how long
there was an inhospitable smell in the room of cold soot and hot dust and as i looked up into the corners of the tester over my head i thought what a number of blue bottle flies from the butchers and earwigs from the market and grubs from the country must be holding on up there lying by for next summer
this led me to speculate whether any of them ever tumbled down and then i fancied that i felt light falls on my face a disagreeable turn of thought suggesting other and more objectionable approaches up my back
when i had lain awake a little while those extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves audible
the closet whispered the fireplace sighed the little washing stand ticked and one guitar string played occasionally in the chest of drawers
at about the same time the eyes on the wall acquired a new expression and in every one of those staring rounds i saw written don t go home
whatever night fancies and night noises crowded on me they never warded off this don t go home
it plaited itself into whatever i thought of as a bodily pain would have done
not long before i had read in the newspapers how a gentleman unknown had come to the hummums in the night and had gone to bed and had destroyed himself and had been found in the morning weltering in blood
it came into my head that he must have occupied this very vault of mine and i got out of bed to assure myself that there were no red marks about then opened the door to look out into the passages and cheer myself with the companionship of a distant light near which i knew the chamberlain to be dozing
but all this time why i was not to go home and what had happened at home and when i should go home and whether provis was safe at home were questions occupying my mind so busily that one might have supposed there could be no more room in it for any other theme
even when i thought of estella and how we had parted that day forever and when i recalled all the circumstances of our parting and all her looks and tones and the action of her fingers while she knitted even then i was pursuing here and there and everywhere the caution don t go home
when at last i dozed in sheer exhaustion of mind and body it became a vast shadowy verb which i had to conjugate
imperative mood present tense do not thou go home let him not go home let us not go home do not ye or you go home let not them go home
then potentially i may not and i cannot go home and i might not could not would not and should not go home until i felt that i was going distracted and rolled over on the pillow and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again
i had left directions that i was to be called at seven for it was plain that i must see wemmick before seeing any one else and equally plain that this was a case in which his walworth sentiments only could be taken
it was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been so miserable and i needed no second knocking at the door to startle me from my uneasy bed
the castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o clock
the little servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls i passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company and so came without announcement into the presence of wemmick as he was making tea for himself and the aged
an open door afforded a perspective view of the aged in bed
halloa mr
pip
said wemmick
you did come home then
yes i returned but i didn t go home
that s all right said he rubbing his hands
i left a note for you at each of the temple gates on the chance
which gate did you come to
i told him
i ll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the notes said wemmick it s a good rule never to leave documentary evidence if you can help it because you don t know when it may be put in
i m going to take a liberty with you
would you mind toasting this sausage for the aged p
i said i should be delighted to do it
then you can go about your work mary anne said wemmick to the little servant which leaves us to ourselves don t you see mr
pip
he added winking as she disappeared
i thanked him for his friendship and caution and our discourse proceeded in a low tone while i toasted the aged s sausage and he buttered the crumb of the aged s roll
now mr pip you know said wemmick you and i understand one another
we are in our private and personal capacities and we have been engaged in a confidential transaction before to day
official sentiments are one thing
we are extra official
i cordially assented
i was so very nervous that i had already lighted the aged s sausage like a torch and been obliged to blow it out
i accidentally heard yesterday morning said wemmick being in a certain place where i once took you even between you and me it s as well not to mention names when avoidable much better not said i
i understand you
i heard there by chance yesterday morning said wemmick that a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits and not unpossessed of portable property i don t know who it may really be we won t name this person not necessary said i
had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good many people go not always in gratification of their own inclinations and not quite irrespective of the government expense in watching his face i made quite a firework of the aged s sausage and greatly discomposed both my own attention and wemmick s for which i apologized
by disappearing from such place and being no more heard of thereabouts
from which said wemmick conjectures had been raised and theories formed
i also heard that you at your chambers in garden court temple had been watched and might be watched again
by whom
said i
i wouldn t go into that said wemmick evasively it might clash with official responsibilities
i heard it as i have in my time heard other curious things in the same place
i don t tell it you on information received
i heard it
he took the toasting fork and sausage from me as he spoke and set forth the aged s breakfast neatly on a little tray
previous to placing it before him he went into the aged s room with a clean white cloth and tied the same under the old gentleman s chin and propped him up and put his nightcap on one side and gave him quite a rakish air
then he placed his breakfast before him with great care and said all right ain t you aged p
to which the cheerful aged replied all right john my boy all right
as there seemed to be a tacit understanding that the aged was not in a presentable state and was therefore to be considered invisible i made a pretence of being in complete ignorance of these proceedings
this watching of me at my chambers which i have once had reason to suspect i said to wemmick when he came back is inseparable from the person to whom you have adverted is it
wemmick looked very serious
i couldn t undertake to say that of my own knowledge
i mean i couldn t undertake to say it was at first
but it either is or it will be or it s in great danger of being
as i saw that he was restrained by fealty to little britain from saying as much as he could and as i knew with thankfulness to him how far out of his way he went to say what he did i could not press him
but i told him after a little meditation over the fire that i would like to ask him a question subject to his answering or not answering as he deemed right and sure that his course would be right
he paused in his breakfast and crossing his arms and pinching his shirt sleeves his notion of in door comfort was to sit without any coat he nodded to me once to put my question
you have heard of a man of bad character whose true name is compeyson
he answered with one other nod
is he living
one other nod
is he in london
he gave me one other nod compressed the post office exceedingly gave me one last nod and went on with his breakfast
now said wemmick questioning being over which he emphasized and repeated for my guidance i come to what i did after hearing what i heard
i went to garden court to find you not finding you i went to clarriker s to find mr
herbert
and him you found
said i with great anxiety
and him i found
without mentioning any names or going into any details i gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody tom jack or richard being about the chambers or about the immediate neighborhood he had better get tom jack or richard out of the way while you were out of the way
he would be greatly puzzled what to do
he was puzzled what to do not the less because i gave him my opinion that it was not safe to try to get tom jack or richard too far out of the way at present
mr pip i ll tell you something
under existing circumstances there is no place like a great city when you are once in it
don t break cover too soon
lie close
wait till things slacken before you try the open even for foreign air
i thanked him for his valuable advice and asked him what herbert had done
mr herbert said wemmick after being all of a heap for half an hour struck out a plan
he mentioned to me as a secret that he is courting a young lady who has as no doubt you are aware a bedridden pa
which pa having been in the purser line of life lies a bed in a bow window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river
you are acquainted with the young lady most probably
not personally said i
the truth was that she had objected to me as an expensive companion who did herbert no good and that when herbert had first proposed to present me to her she had received the proposal with such very moderate warmth that herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of the case to me with a view to the lapse of a little time before i made her acquaintance
when i had begun to advance herbert s prospects by stealth i had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy he and his affianced for their part had naturally not been very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews and thus although i was assured that i had risen in clara s esteem and although the young lady and i had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by herbert i had never seen her
however i did not trouble wemmick with these particulars
the house with the bow window said wemmick being by the river side down the pool there between limehouse and greenwich and being kept it seems by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to let mr herbert put it to me what did i think of that as a temporary tenement for tom jack or richard
now i thought very well of it for three reasons i ll give you
that is to say firstly
it s altogether out of all your beats and is well away from the usual heap of streets great and small
secondly
without going near it yourself you could always hear of the safety of tom jack or richard through mr herbert
thirdly
after a while and when it might be prudent if you should want to slip tom jack or richard on board a foreign packet boat there he is ready
much comforted by these considerations i thanked wemmick again and again and begged him to proceed
well sir
mr herbert threw himself into the business with a will and by nine o clock last night he housed tom jack or richard whichever it may be you and i don t want to know quite successfully
at the old lodgings it was understood that he was summoned to dover and in fact he was taken down the dover road and cornered out of it
now another great advantage of all this is that it was done without you and when if any one was concerning himself about your movements you must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged
this diverts suspicion and confuses it and for the same reason i recommended that even if you came back last night you should not go home
it brings in more confusion and you want confusion
wemmick having finished his breakfast here looked at his watch and began to get his coat on
and now mr pip said he with his hands still in the sleeves i have probably done the most i can do but if i can ever do more from a walworth point of view and in a strictly private and personal capacity i shall be glad to do it
here s the address
there can be no harm in your going here to night and seeing for yourself that all is well with tom jack or richard before you go home which is another reason for your not going home last night
but after you have gone home don t go back here
you are very welcome i am sure mr pip his hands were now out of his sleeves and i was shaking them and let me finally impress one important point upon you
he laid his hands upon my shoulders and added in a solemn whisper avail yourself of this evening to lay hold of his portable property
you don t know what may happen to him
don t let anything happen to the portable property
quite despairing of making my mind clear to wemmick on this point i forbore to try
time s up said wemmick and i must be off
if you had nothing more pressing to do than to keep here till dark that s what i should advise
you look very much worried and it would do you good to have a perfectly quiet day with the aged he ll be up presently and a little bit of you remember the pig
of course said i
well and a little bit of him
that sausage you toasted was his and he was in all respects a first rater
do try him if it is only for old acquaintance sake
good bye aged parent
in a cheery shout
all right john all right my boy
piped the old man from within
i soon fell asleep before wemmick s fire and the aged and i enjoyed one another s society by falling asleep before it more or less all day
we had loin of pork for dinner and greens grown on the estate and i nodded at the aged with a good intention whenever i failed to do it drowsily
when it was quite dark i left the aged preparing the fire for toast and i inferred from the number of teacups as well as from his glances at the two little doors in the wall that miss skiffins was expected
chapter xlvi eight o clock had struck before i got into the air that was scented not disagreeably by the chips and shavings of the long shore boat builders and mast oar and block makers
all that water side region of the upper and lower pool below bridge was unknown ground to me and when i struck down by the river i found that the spot i wanted was not where i had supposed it to be and was anything but easy to find
it was called mill pond bank chinks s basin and i had no other guide to chinks s basin than the old green copper rope walk
it matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks i lost myself among what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide what yards of ship builders and ship breakers what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground though for years off duty what mountainous country of accumulated casks and timber how many rope walks that were not the old green copper
after several times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting it i came unexpectedly round a corner upon mill pond bank
it was a fresh kind of place all circumstances considered where the wind from the river had room to turn itself round and there were two or three trees in it and there was the stump of a ruined windmill and there was the old green copper rope walk whose long and narrow vista i could trace in the moonlight along a series of wooden frames set in the ground that looked like superannuated haymaking rakes which had grown old and lost most of their teeth
selecting from the few queer houses upon mill pond bank a house with a wooden front and three stories of bow window not bay window which is another thing i looked at the plate upon the door and read there mrs whimple
that being the name i wanted i knocked and an elderly woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded
she was immediately deposed however by herbert who silently led me into the parlor and shut the door
it was an odd sensation to see his very familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room and region and i found myself looking at him much as i looked at the corner cupboard with the glass and china the shells upon the chimney piece and the colored engravings on the wall representing the death of captain cook a ship launch and his majesty king george the third in a state coachman s wig leather breeches and top boots on the terrace at windsor
all is well handel said herbert and he is quite satisfied though eager to see you
my dear girl is with her father and if you ll wait till she comes down i ll make you known to her and then we ll go upstairs
that s her father
i had become aware of an alarming growling overhead and had probably expressed the fact in my countenance
i am afraid he is a sad old rascal said herbert smiling but i have never seen him
don t you smell rum
he is always at it
at rum
said i
yes returned herbert and you may suppose how mild it makes his gout
he persists too in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his room and serving them out
he keeps them on shelves over his head and will weigh them all
his room must be like a chandler s shop
while he thus spoke the growling noise became a prolonged roar and then died away
what else can be the consequence said herbert in explanation if he will cut the cheese
a man with the gout in his right hand and everywhere else can t expect to get through a double gloucester without hurting himself
he seemed to have hurt himself very much for he gave another furious roar
to have provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to mrs whimple said herbert for of course people in general won t stand that noise
a curious place handel isn t it
it was a curious place indeed but remarkably well kept and clean
mrs whimple said herbert when i told him so is the best of housewives and i really do not know what my clara would do without her motherly help
for clara has no mother of her own handel and no relation in the world but old gruffandgrim
surely that s not his name herbert
no no said herbert that s my name for him
his name is mr
barley
but what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a girl who has no relations and who can never bother herself or anybody else about her family
herbert had told me on former occasions and now reminded me that he first knew miss clara barley when she was completing her education at an establishment at hammersmith and that on her being recalled home to nurse her father he and she had confided their affection to the motherly mrs whimple by whom it had been fostered and regulated with equal kindness and discretion ever since
it was understood that nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old barley by reason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject more psychological than gout rum and purser s stores
as we were thus conversing in a low tone while old barley s sustained growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling the room door opened and a very pretty slight dark eyed girl of twenty or so came in with a basket in her hand whom herbert tenderly relieved of the basket and presented blushing as clara
she really was a most charming girl and might have passed for a captive fairy whom that truculent ogre old barley had pressed into his service
look here said herbert showing me the basket with a compassionate and tender smile after we had talked a little here s poor clara s supper served out every night
here s her allowance of bread and here s her slice of cheese and here s her rum which i drink
this is mr
barley s breakfast for to morrow served out to be cooked
two mutton chops three potatoes some split peas a little flour two ounces of butter a pinch of salt and all this black pepper
it s stewed up together and taken hot and it s a nice thing for the gout i should think
there was something so natural and winning in clara s resigned way of looking at these stores in detail as herbert pointed them out and something so confiding loving and innocent in her modest manner of yielding herself to herbert s embracing arm and something so gentle in her so much needing protection on mill pond bank by chinks s basin and the old green copper rope walk with old barley growling in the beam that i would not have undone the engagement between her and herbert for all the money in the pocket book i had never opened
i was looking at her with pleasure and admiration when suddenly the growl swelled into a roar again and a frightful bumping noise was heard above as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through the ceiling to come at us
upon this clara said to herbert papa wants me darling
and ran away
there is an unconscionable old shark for you
said herbert
what do you suppose he wants now handel
i don t know said i
something to drink
that s it
cried herbert as if i had made a guess of extraordinary merit
he keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table
wait a moment and you ll hear clara lift him up to take some
there he goes
another roar with a prolonged shake at the end
now said herbert as it was succeeded by silence he s drinking
now said herbert as the growl resounded in the beam once more he s down again on his back
clara returned soon afterwards and herbert accompanied me upstairs to see our charge
as we passed mr
barley s door he was heard hoarsely muttering within in a strain that rose and fell like wind the following refrain in which i substitute good wishes for something quite the reverse ahoy
bless your eyes here s old bill barley
here s old bill barley bless your eyes
here s old bill barley on the flat of his back by the lord
lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder here s your old bill barley bless your eyes
ahoy
bless you
in this strain of consolation herbert informed me the invisible barley would commune with himself by the day and night together often while it was light having at the same time one eye at a telescope which was fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river
in his two cabin rooms at the top of the house which were fresh and airy and in which mr
barley was less audible than below i found provis comfortably settled
he expressed no alarm and seemed to feel none that was worth mentioning but it struck me that he was softened indefinably for i could not have said how and could never afterwards recall how when i tried but certainly
the opportunity that the day s rest had given me for reflection had resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting compeyson
for anything i knew his animosity towards the man might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own destruction
therefore when herbert and i sat down with him by his fire i asked him first of all whether he relied on wemmick s judgment and sources of information
ay ay dear boy
he answered with a grave nod jaggers knows
then i have talked with wemmick said i and have come to tell you what caution he gave me and what advice
this i did accurately with the reservation just mentioned and i told him how wemmick had heard in newgate prison whether from officers or prisoners i could not say that he was under some suspicion and that my chambers had been watched how wemmick had recommended his keeping close for a time and my keeping away from him and what wemmick had said about getting him abroad
i added that of course when the time came i should go with him or should follow close upon him as might be safest in wemmick s judgment
what was to follow that i did not touch upon neither indeed was i at all clear or comfortable about it in my own mind now that i saw him in that softer condition and in declared peril for my sake
as to altering my way of living by enlarging my expenses i put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult circumstances it would not be simply ridiculous if it were no worse
he could not deny this and indeed was very reasonable throughout
his coming back was a venture he said and he had always known it to be a venture
he would do nothing to make it a desperate venture and he had very little fear of his safety with such good help
herbert who had been looking at the fire and pondering here said that something had come into his thoughts arising out of wemmick s suggestion which it might be worth while to pursue
we are both good watermen handel and could take him down the river ourselves when the right time comes
no boat would then be hired for the purpose and no boatmen that would save at least a chance of suspicion and any chance is worth saving
never mind the season don t you think it might be a good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the temple stairs and were in the habit of rowing up and down the river
you fall into that habit and then who notices or minds
do it twenty or fifty times and there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty first or fifty first
i liked this scheme and provis was quite elated by it
we agreed that it should be carried into execution and that provis should never recognize us if we came below bridge and rowed past mill pond bank
but we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his window which gave upon the east whenever he saw us and all was right
our conference being now ended and everything arranged i rose to go remarking to herbert that he and i had better not go home together and that i would take half an hour s start of him
i don t like to leave you here i said to provis though i cannot doubt your being safer here than near me
good bye
dear boy he answered clasping my hands i don t know when we may meet again and i don t like good bye
say good night
good night
herbert will go regularly between us and when the time comes you may be certain i shall be ready
good night good night
we thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms and we left him on the landing outside his door holding a light over the stair rail to light us downstairs
looking back at him i thought of the first night of his return when our positions were reversed and when i little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him as it was now
old barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door with no appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease
when we got to the foot of the stairs i asked herbert whether he had preserved the name of provis
he replied certainly not and that the lodger was mr campbell
he also explained that the utmost known of mr campbell there was that he herbert had mr campbell consigned to him and felt a strong personal interest in his being well cared for and living a secluded life
so when we went into the parlor where mrs whimple and clara were seated at work i said nothing of my own interest in mr campbell but kept it to myself
when i had taken leave of the pretty gentle dark eyed girl and of the motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little affair of true love i felt as if the old green copper rope walk had grown quite a different place
old barley might be as old as the hills and might swear like a whole field of troopers but there were redeeming youth and trust and hope enough in chinks s basin to fill it to overflowing
and then i thought of estella and of our parting and went home very sadly
all things were as quiet in the temple as ever i had seen them
the windows of the rooms on that side lately occupied by provis were dark and still and there was no lounger in garden court
i walked past the fountain twice or thrice before i descended the steps that were between me and my rooms but i was quite alone
herbert coming to my bedside when he came in for i went straight to bed dispirited and fatigued made the same report
opening one of the windows after that he looked out into the moonlight and told me that the pavement was as solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour
next day i set myself to get the boat
it was soon done and the boat was brought round to the temple stairs and lay where i could reach her within a minute or two
then i began to go out as for training and practice sometimes alone sometimes with herbert
i was often out in cold rain and sleet but nobody took much note of me after i had been out a few times
at first i kept above blackfriars bridge but as the hours of the tide changed i took towards london bridge
it was old london bridge in those days and at certain states of the tide there was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation
but i knew well enough how to shoot the bridge after seeing it done and so began to row about among the shipping in the pool and down to erith
the first time i passed mill pond bank herbert and i were pulling a pair of oars and both in going and returning we saw the blind towards the east come down
herbert was rarely there less frequently than three times in a week and he never brought me a single word of intelligence that was at all alarming
still i knew that there was cause for alarm and i could not get rid of the notion of being watched
once received it is a haunting idea how many undesigning persons i suspected of watching me it would be hard to calculate
in short i was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding
herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at one of our windows after dark when the tide was running down and to think that it was flowing with everything it bore towards clara
but i thought with dread that it was flowing towards magwitch and that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers going swiftly silently and surely to take him
chapter xlvii some weeks passed without bringing any change
we waited for wemmick and he made no sign
if i had never known him out of little britain and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the castle i might have doubted him not so for a moment knowing him as i did
my worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance and i was pressed for money by more than one creditor
even i myself began to know the want of money i mean of ready money in my own pocket and to relieve it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash
but i had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and plans
therefore i had sent him the unopened pocket book by herbert to hold in his own keeping and i felt a kind of satisfaction whether it was a false kind or a true i hardly know in not having profited by his generosity since his revelation of himself
as the time wore on an impression settled heavily upon me that estella was married
fearful of having it confirmed though it was all but a conviction i avoided the newspapers and begged herbert to whom i had confided the circumstances of our last interview never to speak of her to me
why i hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of hope that was rent and given to the winds how do i know
why did you who read this commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last year last month last week
it was an unhappy life that i lived and its one dominant anxiety towering over all its other anxieties like a high mountain above a range of mountains never disappeared from my view
still no new cause for fear arose
let me start from my bed as i would with the terror fresh upon me that he was discovered let me sit listening as i would with dread for herbert s returning step at night lest it should be fleeter than ordinary and winged with evil news for all that and much more to like purpose the round of things went on
condemned to inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense i rowed about in my boat and waited waited waited as i best could
there were states of the tide when having been down the river i could not get back through the eddy chafed arches and starlings of old london bridge then i left my boat at a wharf near the custom house to be brought up afterwards to the temple stairs
i was not averse to doing this as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the water side people there
from this slight occasion sprang two meetings that i have now to tell of
one afternoon late in the month of february i came ashore at the wharf at dusk
i had pulled down as far as greenwich with the ebb tide and had turned with the tide
it had been a fine bright day but had become foggy as the sun dropped and i had had to feel my way back among the shipping pretty carefully
both in going and returning i had seen the signal in his window all well
as it was a raw evening and i was cold i thought i would comfort myself with dinner at once and as i had hours of dejection and solitude before me if i went home to the temple i thought i would afterwards go to the play
the theatre where mr wopsle had achieved his questionable triumph was in that water side neighborhood it is nowhere now and to that theatre i resolved to go
i was aware that mr wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the drama but on the contrary had rather partaken of its decline
he had been ominously heard of through the play bills as a faithful black in connection with a little girl of noble birth and a monkey
and herbert had seen him as a predatory tartar of comic propensities with a face like a red brick and an outrageous hat all over bells
i dined at what herbert and i used to call a geographical chop house where there were maps of the world in porter pot rims on every half yard of the tablecloths and charts of gravy on every one of the knives to this day there is scarcely a single chop house within the lord mayor s dominions which is not geographical and wore out the time in dozing over crumbs staring at gas and baking in a hot blast of dinners
by and by i roused myself and went to the play
there i found a virtuous boatswain in his majesty s service a most excellent man though i could have wished his trousers not quite so tight in some places and not quite so loose in others who knocked all the little men s hats over their eyes though he was very generous and brave and who wouldn t hear of anybody s paying taxes though he was very patriotic
he had a bag of money in his pocket like a pudding in the cloth and on that property married a young person in bed furniture with great rejoicings the whole population of portsmouth nine in number at the last census turning out on the beach to rub their own hands and shake everybody else s and sing fill fill
a certain dark complexioned swab however who wouldn t fill or do anything else that was proposed to him and whose heart was openly stated by the boatswain to be as black as his figure head proposed to two other swabs to get all mankind into difficulties which was so effectually done the swab family having considerable political influence that it took half the evening to set things right and then it was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white hat black gaiters and red nose getting into a clock with a gridiron and listening and coming out and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron whom he couldn t confute with what he had overheard
this led to mr wopsle s who had never been heard of before coming in with a star and garter on as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the admiralty to say that the swabs were all to go to prison on the spot and that he had brought the boatswain down the union jack as a slight acknowledgment of his public services
the boatswain unmanned for the first time respectfully dried his eyes on the jack and then cheering up and addressing mr wopsle as your honor solicited permission to take him by the fin
mr wopsle conceding his fin with a gracious dignity was immediately shoved into a dusty corner while everybody danced a hornpipe and from that corner surveying the public with a discontented eye became aware of me
the second piece was the last new grand comic christmas pantomime in the first scene of which it pained me to suspect that i detected mr wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric countenance and a shock of red curtain fringe for his hair engaged in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine and displaying great cowardice when his gigantic master came home very hoarse to dinner
but he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances for the genius of youthful love being in want of assistance on account of the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of his daughter s heart by purposely falling upon the object in a flour sack out of the first floor window summoned a sententious enchanter and he coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily after an apparently violent journey proved to be mr wopsle in a high crowned hat with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm
the business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked at sung at butted at danced at and flashed at with fires of various colors he had a good deal of time on his hands
and i observed with great surprise that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were lost in amazement
there was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of mr wopsle s eye and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his mind and to grow so confused that i could not make it out
i sat thinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large watch case and still i could not make it out
i was still thinking of it when i came out of the theatre an hour afterwards and found him waiting for me near the door
how do you do
said i shaking hands with him as we turned down the street together
i saw that you saw me
saw you mr
pip
he returned
yes of course i saw you
but who else was there
who else
it is the strangest thing said mr wopsle drifting into his lost look again and yet i could swear to him
becoming alarmed i entreated mr wopsle to explain his meaning
whether i should have noticed him at first but for your being there said mr wopsle going on in the same lost way i can t be positive yet i think i should
involuntarily i looked round me as i was accustomed to look round me when i went home for these mysterious words gave me a chill
oh
he can t be in sight said mr wopsle
he went out before i went off
i saw him go
having the reason that i had for being suspicious i even suspected this poor actor
i mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission
therefore i glanced at him as we walked on together but said nothing
i had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you mr pip till i saw that you were quite unconscious of him sitting behind you there like a ghost
my former chill crept over me again but i was resolved not to speak yet for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on to induce me to connect these references with provis
of course i was perfectly sure and safe that provis had not been there
i dare say you wonder at me mr pip indeed i see you do
but it is so very strange
you ll hardly believe what i am going to tell you
i could hardly believe it myself if you told me
indeed
said i
no indeed
mr pip you remember in old times a certain christmas day when you were quite a child and i dined at gargery s and some soldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended
i remember it very well
and you remember that there was a chase after two convicts and that we joined in it and that gargery took you on his back and that i took the lead and you kept up with me as well as you could
i remember it all very well
better than he thought except the last clause
and you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch and that there was a scuffle between them and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other
i see it all before me
and that the soldiers lighted torches and put the two in the centre and that we went on to see the last of them over the black marshes with the torchlight shining on their faces i am particular about that with the torchlight shining on their faces when there was an outer ring of dark night all about us
yes said i
i remember all that
then mr pip one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight
i saw him over your shoulder
steady
i thought
i asked him then which of the two do you suppose you saw
the one who had been mauled he answered readily and i ll swear i saw him
the more i think of him the more certain i am of him
this is very curious
said i with the best assumption i could put on of its being nothing more to me
very curious indeed
i cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation threw me or the special and peculiar terror i felt at compeyson s having been behind me like a ghost
for if he had ever been out of my thoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun it was in those very moments when he was closest to me and to think that i should be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if i had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out and then had found him at my elbow
i could not doubt either that he was there because i was there and that however slight an appearance of danger there might be about us danger was always near and active
i put such questions to mr wopsle as when did the man come in
he could not tell me that he saw me and over my shoulder he saw the man
it was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identify him but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me and known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time
how was he dressed
prosperously but not noticeably otherwise he thought in black
was his face at all disfigured
no he believed not
i believed not too for although in my brooding state i had taken no especial notice of the people behind me i thought it likely that a face at all disfigured would have attracted my attention
when mr wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or i extract and when i had treated him to a little appropriate refreshment after the fatigues of the evening we parted
it was between twelve and one o clock when i reached the temple and the gates were shut
no one was near me when i went in and went home
herbert had come in and we held a very serious council by the fire
but there was nothing to be done saving to communicate to wemmick what i had that night found out and to remind him that we waited for his hint
as i thought that i might compromise him if i went too often to the castle i made this communication by letter
i wrote it before i went to bed and went out and posted it and again no one was near me
herbert and i agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious
and we were very cautious indeed more cautious than before if that were possible and i for my part never went near chinks s basin except when i rowed by and then i only looked at mill pond bank as i looked at anything else
chapter xlviii the second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred about a week after the first
i had again left my boat at the wharf below bridge the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon and undecided where to dine i had strolled up into cheapside and was strolling along it surely the most unsettled person in all the busy concourse when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one overtaking me
it was mr jaggers s hand and he passed it through my arm
as we are going in the same direction pip we may walk together
where are you bound for
for the temple i think said i
don t you know
said mr jaggers
well i returned glad for once to get the better of him in cross examination i do not know for i have not made up my mind
you are going to dine
said mr jaggers
you don t mind admitting that i suppose
no i returned i don t mind admitting that
and are not engaged
i don t mind admitting also that i am not engaged
then said mr jaggers come and dine with me
i was going to excuse myself when he added wemmick s coming
so i changed my excuse into an acceptance the few words i had uttered serving for the beginning of either and we went along cheapside and slanted off to little britain while the lights were springing up brilliantly in the shop windows and the street lamp lighters scarcely finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the afternoon s bustle were skipping up and down and running in and out opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at the hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall
at the office in little britain there was the usual letter writing hand washing candle snuffing and safe locking that closed the business of the day
as i stood idle by mr jaggers s fire its rising and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were playing a diabolical game at bo peep with me while the pair of coarse fat office candles that dimly lighted mr jaggers as he wrote in a corner were decorated with dirty winding sheets as if in remembrance of a host of hanged clients
we went to gerrard street all three together in a hackney coach and as soon as we got there dinner was served
although i should not have thought of making in that place the most distant reference by so much as a look to wemmick s walworth sentiments yet i should have had no objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way
but it was not to be done
he turned his eyes on mr jaggers whenever he raised them from the table and was as dry and distant to me as if there were twin wemmicks and this was the wrong one
did you send that note of miss havisham s to mr pip wemmick
mr jaggers asked soon after we began dinner
no sir returned wemmick it was going by post when you brought mr pip into the office
here it is
he handed it to his principal instead of to me
it s a note of two lines pip said mr jaggers handing it on sent up to me by miss havisham on account of her not being sure of your address
she tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of business you mentioned to her
you ll go down
yes said i casting my eyes over the note which was exactly in those terms
when do you think of going down
i have an impending engagement said i glancing at wemmick who was putting fish into the post office that renders me rather uncertain of my time
at once i think
if mr pip has the intention of going at once said wemmick to mr jaggers he needn t write an answer you know
receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay i settled that i would go to morrow and said so
wemmick drank a glass of wine and looked with a grimly satisfied air at mr jaggers but not at me
so pip
our friend the spider said mr jaggers has played his cards
he has won the pool
it was as much as i could do to assent
hah
he is a promising fellow in his way but he may not have it all his own way
the stronger will win in the end but the stronger has to be found out first
if he should turn to and beat her surely i interrupted with a burning face and heart you do not seriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that mr
jaggers
i didn t say so pip
i am putting a case
if he should turn to and beat her he may possibly get the strength on his side if it should be a question of intellect he certainly will not
it would be chance work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such circumstances because it s a toss up between two results
may i ask what they are
a fellow like our friend the spider answered mr jaggers either beats or cringes
he may cringe and growl or cringe and not growl but he either beats or cringes
ask wemmick his opinion
either beats or cringes said wemmick not at all addressing himself to me
so here s to mrs bentley drummle said mr jaggers taking a decanter of choicer wine from his dumb waiter and filling for each of us and for himself and may the question of supremacy be settled to the lady s satisfaction
to the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman it never will be
now molly molly molly molly how slow you are to day
she was at his elbow when he addressed her putting a dish upon the table
as she withdrew her hands from it she fell back a step or two nervously muttering some excuse
and a certain action of her fingers as she spoke arrested my attention
what s the matter
said mr jaggers
nothing
only the subject we were speaking of said i was rather painful to me
the action of her fingers was like the action of knitting
she stood looking at her master not understanding whether she was free to go or whether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did go
her look was very intent
surely i had seen exactly such eyes and such hands on a memorable occasion very lately
he dismissed her and she glided out of the room
but she remained before me as plainly as if she were still there
i looked at those hands i looked at those eyes i looked at that flowing hair and i compared them with other hands other eyes other hair that i knew of and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and a stormy life
i looked again at those hands and eyes of the housekeeper and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over me when i last walked not alone in the ruined garden and through the deserted brewery
i thought how the same feeling had come back when i saw a face looking at me and a hand waving to me from a stage coach window and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like lightning when i had passed in a carriage not alone through a sudden glare of light in a dark street
i thought how one link of association had helped that identification in the theatre and how such a link wanting before had been riveted for me now when i had passed by a chance swift from estella s name to the fingers with their knitting action and the attentive eyes
and i felt absolutely certain that this woman was estella s mother
mr jaggers had seen me with estella and was not likely to have missed the sentiments i had been at no pains to conceal
he nodded when i said the subject was painful to me clapped me on the back put round the wine again and went on with his dinner
only twice more did the housekeeper reappear and then her stay in the room was very short and mr jaggers was sharp with her
but her hands were estella s hands and her eyes were estella s eyes and if she had reappeared a hundred times i could have been neither more sure nor less sure that my conviction was the truth
it was a dull evening for wemmick drew his wine when it came round quite as a matter of business just as he might have drawn his salary when that came round and with his eyes on his chief sat in a state of perpetual readiness for cross examination
as to the quantity of wine his post office was as indifferent and ready as any other post office for its quantity of letters
from my point of view he was the wrong twin all the time and only externally like the wemmick of walworth
we took our leave early and left together
even when we were groping among mr jaggers s stock of boots for our hats i felt that the right twin was on his way back and we had not gone half a dozen yards down gerrard street in the walworth direction before i found that i was walking arm in arm with the right twin and that the wrong twin had evaporated into the evening air
well
said wemmick that s over
he s a wonderful man without his living likeness but i feel that i have to screw myself up when i dine with him and i dine more comfortably unscrewed
i felt that this was a good statement of the case and told him so
wouldn t say it to anybody but yourself he answered
i know that what is said between you and me goes no further
i asked him if he had ever seen miss havisham s adopted daughter mrs bentley drummle
he said no
to avoid being too abrupt i then spoke of the aged and of miss skiffins
he looked rather sly when i mentioned miss skiffins and stopped in the street to blow his nose with a roll of the head and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness
wemmick said i do you remember telling me before i first went to mr jaggers s private house to notice that housekeeper
did i
he replied
ah i dare say i did
deuce take me he added suddenly i know i did
i find i am not quite unscrewed yet
a wild beast tamed you called her
and what do you call her
the same
how did mr jaggers tame her wemmick
that s his secret
she has been with him many a long year
i wish you would tell me her story
i feel a particular interest in being acquainted with it
you know that what is said between you and me goes no further
well
wemmick replied i don t know her story that is i don t know all of it
but what i do know i ll tell you
we are in our private and personal capacities of course
of course
a score or so of years ago that woman was tried at the old bailey for murder and was acquitted
she was a very handsome young woman and i believe had some gypsy blood in her
anyhow it was hot enough when it was up as you may suppose
but she was acquitted
mr jaggers was for her pursued wemmick with a look full of meaning and worked the case in a way quite astonishing
it was a desperate case and it was comparatively early days with him then and he worked it to general admiration in fact it may almost be said to have made him
he worked it himself at the police office day after day for many days contending against even a committal and at the trial where he couldn t work it himself sat under counsel and every one knew put in all the salt and pepper
the murdered person was a woman a woman a good ten years older very much larger and very much stronger
it was a case of jealousy
they both led tramping lives and this woman in gerrard street here had been married very young over the broomstick as we say to a tramping man and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy
the murdered woman more a match for the man certainly in point of years was found dead in a barn near hounslow heath
there had been a violent struggle perhaps a fight
she was bruised and scratched and torn and had been held by the throat at last and choked
now there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it mr jaggers principally rested his case
you may be sure said wemmick touching me on the sleeve that he never dwelt upon the strength of her hands then though he sometimes does now
i had told wemmick of his showing us her wrists that day of the dinner party
well sir
wemmick went on it happened happened don t you see that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her apprehension that she looked much slighter than she really was in particular her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look
she had only a bruise or two about her nothing for a tramp but the backs of her hands were lacerated and the question was was it with finger nails
now mr jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles which were not as high as her face but which she could not have got through and kept her hands out of and bits of those brambles were actually found in her skin and put in evidence as well as the fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken through and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of blood upon them here and there
but the boldest point he made was this it was attempted to be set up in proof of her jealousy that she was under strong suspicion of having at about the time of the murder frantically destroyed her child by this man some three years old to revenge herself upon him
mr jaggers worked that in this way we say these are not marks of finger nails but marks of brambles and we show you the brambles
you say they are marks of finger nails and you set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child
you must accept all consequences of that hypothesis
for anything we know she may have destroyed her child and the child in clinging to her may have scratched her hands
what then
you are not trying her for the murder of her child why don t you
as to this case if you will have scratches we say that for anything we know you may have accounted for them assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them
to sum up sir said wemmick mr jaggers was altogether too many for the jury and they gave in
has she been in his service ever since
yes but not only that said wemmick she went into his service immediately after her acquittal tamed as she is now
she has since been taught one thing and another in the way of her duties but she was tamed from the beginning
do you remember the sex of the child
said to have been a girl
you have nothing more to say to me to night
nothing
i got your letter and destroyed it
nothing
we exchanged a cordial good night and i went home with new matter for my thoughts though with no relief from the old
chapter xlix putting miss havisham s note in my pocket that it might serve as my credentials for so soon reappearing at satis house in case her waywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me i went down again by the coach next day
but i alighted at the halfway house and breakfasted there and walked the rest of the distance for i sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways and to leave it in the same manner
the best light of the day was gone when i passed along the quiet echoing courts behind the high street
the nooks of ruin where the old monks had once had their refectories and gardens and where the strong walls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables were almost as silent as the old monks in their graves
the cathedral chimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me as i hurried on avoiding observation than they had ever had before so the swell of the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music and the rooks as they hovered about the gray tower and swung in the bare high trees of the priory garden seemed to call to me that the place was changed and that estella was gone out of it for ever
an elderly woman whom i had seen before as one of the servants who lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard opened the gate
the lighted candle stood in the dark passage within as of old and i took it up and ascended the staircase alone
miss havisham was not in her own room but was in the larger room across the landing
looking in at the door after knocking in vain i saw her sitting on the hearth in a ragged chair close before and lost in the contemplation of the ashy fire
doing as i had often done i went in and stood touching the old chimney piece where she could see me when she raised her eyes
there was an air of utter loneliness upon her that would have moved me to pity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than i could charge her with
as i stood compassionating her and thinking how in the progress of time i too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of that house her eyes rested on me
she stared and said in a low voice is it real
it is i pip
mr jaggers gave me your note yesterday and i have lost no time
thank you
thank you
as i brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down i remarked a new expression on her face as if she were afraid of me
i want she said to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you were last here and to show you that i am not all stone
but perhaps you can never believe now that there is anything human in my heart
when i said some reassuring words she stretched out her tremulous right hand as though she was going to touch me but she recalled it again before i understood the action or knew how to receive it
you said speaking for your friend that you could tell me how to do something useful and good
something that you would like done is it not
something that i would like done very much
what is it
i began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership
i had not got far into it when i judged from her looks that she was thinking in a discursive way of me rather than of what i said
it seemed to be so for when i stopped speaking many moments passed before she showed that she was conscious of the fact
do you break off she asked then with her former air of being afraid of me because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me
no no i answered how can you think so miss havisham
i stopped because i thought you were not following what i said
perhaps i was not she answered putting a hand to her head
begin again and let me look at something else
stay
now tell me
she set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was habitual to her and looked at the fire with a strong expression of forcing herself to attend
i went on with my explanation and told her how i had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means but how in this i was disappointed
that part of the subject i reminded her involved matters which could form no part of my explanation for they were the weighty secrets of another
so
said she assenting with her head but not looking at me
and how much money is wanting to complete the purchase
i was rather afraid of stating it for it sounded a large sum
nine hundred pounds
if i give you the money for this purpose will you keep my secret as you have kept your own
quite as faithfully
and your mind will be more at rest
much more at rest
are you very unhappy now
she asked this question still without looking at me but in an unwonted tone of sympathy
i could not reply at the moment for my voice failed me
she put her left arm across the head of her stick and softly laid her forehead on it
i am far from happy miss havisham but i have other causes of disquiet than any you know of
they are the secrets i have mentioned
after a little while she raised her head and looked at the fire again
it is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of unhappiness
is it true
too true
can i only serve you pip by serving your friend
regarding that as done is there nothing i can do for you yourself
nothing
i thank you for the question
i thank you even more for the tone of the question
but there is nothing
she presently rose from her seat and looked about the blighted room for the means of writing
there were none there and she took from her pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets mounted in tarnished gold and wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from her neck
you are still on friendly terms with mr
jaggers
quite
i dined with him yesterday
this is an authority to him to pay you that money to lay out at your irresponsible discretion for your friend
i keep no money here but if you would rather mr jaggers knew nothing of the matter i will send it to you
thank you miss havisham i have not the least objection to receiving it from him
she read me what she had written and it was direct and clear and evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the receipt of the money
i took the tablets from her hand and it trembled again and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the pencil was attached and put it in mine
all this she did without looking at me
my name is on the first leaf
if you can ever write under my name i forgive her though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do it
o miss havisham said i i can do it now
there have been sore mistakes and my life has been a blind and thankless one and i want forgiveness and direction far too much to be bitter with you
she turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it and to my amazement i may even add to my terror dropped on her knees at my feet with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which when her poor heart was young and fresh and whole they must often have been raised to heaven from her mother s side
to see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet gave me a shock through all my frame
i entreated her to rise and got my arms about her to help her up but she only pressed that hand of mine which was nearest to her grasp and hung her head over it and wept
i had never seen her shed a tear before and in the hope that the relief might do her good i bent over her without speaking
she was not kneeling now but was down upon the ground
o
she cried despairingly
what have i done
what have i done
if you mean miss havisham what have you done to injure me let me answer
very little
i should have loved her under any circumstances
is she married
yes
it was a needless question for a new desolation in the desolate house had told me so
what have i done
what have i done
she wrung her hands and crushed her white hair and returned to this cry over and over again
what have i done
i knew not how to answer or how to comfort her
that she had done a grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form that her wild resentment spurned affection and wounded pride found vengeance in i knew full well
but that in shutting out the light of day she had shut out infinitely more that in seclusion she had secluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences that her mind brooding solitary had grown diseased as all minds do and must and will that reverse the appointed order of their maker i knew equally well
and could i look upon her without compassion seeing her punishment in the ruin she was in her profound unfitness for this earth on which she was placed in the vanity of sorrow which had become a master mania like the vanity of penitence the vanity of remorse the vanity of unworthiness and other monstrous vanities that have been curses in this world
until you spoke to her the other day and until i saw in you a looking glass that showed me what i once felt myself i did not know what i had done
what have i done
what have i done
and so again twenty fifty times over what had she done
miss havisham i said when her cry had died away you may dismiss me from your mind and conscience
but estella is a different case and if you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a part of her right nature away from her it will be better to do that than to bemoan the past through a hundred years
yes yes i know it
but pip my dear
there was an earnest womanly compassion for me in her new affection
my dear
believe this when she first came to me i meant to save her from misery like my own
at first i meant no more
well well
said i
i hope so
but as she grew and promised to be very beautiful i gradually did worse and with my praises and with my jewels and with my teachings and with this figure of myself always before her a warning to back and point my lessons i stole her heart away and put ice in its place
better i could not help saying to have left her a natural heart even to be bruised or broken
with that miss havisham looked distractedly at me for a while and then burst out again what had she done
if you knew all my story she pleaded you would have some compassion for me and a better understanding of me
miss havisham i answered as delicately as i could i believe i may say that i do know your story and have known it ever since i first left this neighborhood
it has inspired me with great commiseration and i hope i understand it and its influences
does what has passed between us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to estella
not as she is but as she was when she first came here
she was seated on the ground with her arms on the ragged chair and her head leaning on them
she looked full at me when i said this and replied go on
whose child was estella
she shook her head
you don t know
she shook her head again
but mr jaggers brought her here or sent her here
brought her here
will you tell me how that came about
she answered in a low whisper and with caution i had been shut up in these rooms a long time i don t know how long you know what time the clocks keep here when i told him that i wanted a little girl to rear and love and save from my fate
i had first seen him when i sent for him to lay this place waste for me having read of him in the newspapers before i and the world parted
he told me that he would look about him for such an orphan child
one night he brought her here asleep and i called her estella
might i ask her age then
two or three
she herself knows nothing but that she was left an orphan and i adopted her
so convinced i was of that woman s being her mother that i wanted no evidence to establish the fact in my own mind
but to any mind i thought the connection here was clear and straight
what more could i hope to do by prolonging the interview
i had succeeded on behalf of herbert miss havisham had told me all she knew of estella i had said and done what i could to ease her mind
no matter with what other words we parted we parted
twilight was closing in when i went downstairs into the natural air
i called to the woman who had opened the gate when i entered that i would not trouble her just yet but would walk round the place before leaving
for i had a presentiment that i should never be there again and i felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it
by the wilderness of casks that i had walked on long ago and on which the rain of years had fallen since rotting them in many places and leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on end i made my way to the ruined garden
i went all round it round by the corner where herbert and i had fought our battle round by the paths where estella and i had walked
so cold so lonely so dreary all
taking the brewery on my way back i raised the rusty latch of a little door at the garden end of it and walked through
i was going out at the opposite door not easy to open now for the damp wood had started and swelled and the hinges were yielding and the threshold was encumbered with a growth of fungus when i turned my head to look back
a childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight action and i fancied that i saw miss havisham hanging to the beam
so strong was the impression that i stood under the beam shuddering from head to foot before i knew it was a fancy though to be sure i was there in an instant
the mournfulness of the place and time and the great terror of this illusion though it was but momentary caused me to feel an indescribable awe as i came out between the open wooden gates where i had once wrung my hair after estella had wrung my heart
passing on into the front courtyard i hesitated whether to call the woman to let me out at the locked gate of which she had the key or first to go upstairs and assure myself that miss havisham was as safe and well as i had left her
i took the latter course and went up
i looked into the room where i had left her and i saw her seated in the ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire with her back towards me
in the moment when i was withdrawing my head to go quietly away i saw a great flaming light spring up
in the same moment i saw her running at me shrieking with a whirl of fire blazing all about her and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high
i had a double caped great coat on and over my arm another thick coat
that i got them off closed with her threw her down and got them over her that i dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst and all the ugly things that sheltered there that we were on the ground struggling like desperate enemies and that the closer i covered her the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself that this occurred i knew through the result but not through anything i felt or thought or knew i did
i knew nothing until i knew that we were on the floor by the great table and that patches of tinder yet alight were floating in the smoky air which a moment ago had been her faded bridal dress
then i looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running away over the floor and the servants coming in with breathless cries at the door
i still held her forcibly down with all my strength like a prisoner who might escape and i doubt if i even knew who she was or why we had struggled or that she had been in flames or that the flames were out until i saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us
she was insensible and i was afraid to have her moved or even touched
assistance was sent for and i held her until it came as if i unreasonably fancied i think i did that if i let her go the fire would break out again and consume her
when i got up on the surgeon s coming to her with other aid i was astonished to see that both my hands were burnt for i had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling
on examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts but that they of themselves were far from hopeless the danger lay mainly in the nervous shock
by the surgeon s directions her bed was carried into that room and laid upon the great table which happened to be well suited to the dressing of her injuries
when i saw her again an hour afterwards she lay indeed where i had seen her strike her stick and had heard her say that she would lie one day
though every vestige of her dress was burnt as they told me she still had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance for they had covered her to the throat with white cotton wool and as she lay with a white sheet loosely overlying that the phantom air of something that had been and was changed was still upon her
i found on questioning the servants that estella was in paris and i got a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the next post
miss havisham s family i took upon myself intending to communicate with mr matthew pocket only and leave him to do as he liked about informing the rest
this i did next day through herbert as soon as i returned to town
there was a stage that evening when she spoke collectedly of what had happened though with a certain terrible vivacity
towards midnight she began to wander in her speech and after that it gradually set in that she said innumerable times in a low solemn voice what have i done
and then when she first came i meant to save her from misery like mine
and then take the pencil and write under my name i forgive her
she never changed the order of these three sentences but she sometimes left out a word in one or other of them never putting in another word but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word
as i could do no service there and as i had nearer home that pressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could not drive out of my mind i decided in the course of the night that i would return by the early morning coach walking on a mile or so and being taken up clear of the town
at about six o clock of the morning therefore i leaned over her and touched her lips with mine just as they said not stopping for being touched take the pencil and write under my name i forgive her
chapter l my hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night and again in the morning
my left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow and less severely as high as the shoulder it was very painful but the flames had set in that direction and i felt thankful it was no worse
my right hand was not so badly burnt but that i could move the fingers
it was bandaged of course but much less inconveniently than my left hand and arm those i carried in a sling and i could only wear my coat like a cloak loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck
my hair had been caught by the fire but not my head or face
when herbert had been down to hammersmith and seen his father he came back to me at our chambers and devoted the day to attending on me
he was the kindest of nurses and at stated times took off the bandages and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready and put them on again with a patient tenderness that i was deeply grateful for
at first as i lay quiet on the sofa i found it painfully difficult i might say impossible to get rid of the impression of the glare of the flames their hurry and noise and the fierce burning smell
if i dozed for a minute i was awakened by miss havisham s cries and by her running at me with all that height of fire above her head
this pain of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain i suffered and herbert seeing that did his utmost to hold my attention engaged
neither of us spoke of the boat but we both thought of it
that was made apparent by our avoidance of the subject and by our agreeing without agreement to make my recovery of the use of my hands a question of so many hours not of so many weeks
my first question when i saw herbert had been of course whether all was well down the river
as he replied in the affirmative with perfect confidence and cheerfulness we did not resume the subject until the day was wearing away
but then as herbert changed the bandages more by the light of the fire than by the outer light he went back to it spontaneously
i sat with provis last night handel two good hours
where was clara
dear little thing
said herbert
she was up and down with gruffandgrim all the evening
he was perpetually pegging at the floor the moment she left his sight
i doubt if he can hold out long though
what with rum and pepper and pepper and rum i should think his pegging must be nearly over
and then you will be married herbert
how can i take care of the dear child otherwise lay your arm out upon the back of the sofa my dear boy and i ll sit down here and get the bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes
i was speaking of provis
do you know handel he improves
i said to you i thought he was softened when i last saw him
so you did
and so he is
he was very communicative last night and told me more of his life
you remember his breaking off here about some woman that he had had great trouble with did i hurt you
i had started but not under his touch
his words had given me a start
i had forgotten that herbert but i remember it now you speak of it
well
he went into that part of his life and a dark wild part it is
shall i tell you
or would it worry you just now
tell me by all means
every word
herbert bent forward to look at me more nearly as if my reply had been rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for
your head is cool
he said touching it
quite said i
tell me what provis said my dear herbert
it seems said herbert there s a bandage off most charmingly and now comes the cool one makes you shrink at first my poor dear fellow don t it
but it will be comfortable presently it seems that the woman was a young woman and a jealous woman and a revengeful woman revengeful handel to the last degree
to what last degree
murder does it strike too cold on that sensitive place
i don t feel it
how did she murder
whom did she murder
why the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name said herbert but she was tried for it and mr jaggers defended her and the reputation of that defence first made his name known to provis
it was another and a stronger woman who was the victim and there had been a struggle in a barn
who began it or how fair it was or how unfair may be doubtful but how it ended is certainly not doubtful for the victim was found throttled
was the woman brought in guilty
no she was acquitted my poor handel i hurt you
it is impossible to be gentler herbert
yes
what else
this acquitted young woman and provis had a little child a little child of whom provis was exceedingly fond
on the evening of the very night when the object of her jealousy was strangled as i tell you the young woman presented herself before provis for one moment and swore that she would destroy the child which was in her possession and he should never see it again then she vanished there s the worst arm comfortably in the sling once more and now there remains but the right hand which is a far easier job
i can do it better by this light than by a stronger for my hand is steadiest when i don t see the poor blistered patches too distinctly you don t think your breathing is affected my dear boy
you seem to breathe quickly
perhaps i do herbert
did the woman keep her oath
there comes the darkest part of provis s life
she did
that is he says she did
why of course my dear boy returned herbert in a tone of surprise and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me
he says it all
i have no other information
no to be sure
now whether pursued herbert he had used the child s mother ill or whether he had used the child s mother well provis doesn t say but she had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described to us at this fireside and he seems to have felt pity for her and forbearance towards her
therefore fearing he should be called upon to depose about this destroyed child and so be the cause of her death he hid himself much as he grieved for the child kept himself dark as he says out of the way and out of the trial and was only vaguely talked of as a certain man called abel out of whom the jealousy arose
after the acquittal she disappeared and thus he lost the child and the child s mother
i want to ask a moment my dear boy and i have done
that evil genius compeyson the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels knowing of his keeping out of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so of course afterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him poorer and working him harder
it was clear last night that this barbed the point of provis s animosity
i want to know said i and particularly herbert whether he told you when this happened
particularly
let me remember then what he said as to that
his expression was a round score o year ago and a most directly after i took up wi compeyson
how old were you when you came upon him in the little churchyard
i think in my seventh year
ay
it had happened some three or four years then he said and you brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost who would have been about your age
herbert said i after a short silence in a hurried way can you see me best by the light of the window or the light of the fire
by the firelight answered herbert coming close again
look at me
i do look at you my dear boy
touch me
i do touch you my dear boy
you are not afraid that i am in any fever or that my head is much disordered by the accident of last night
n no my dear boy said herbert after taking time to examine me
you are rather excited but you are quite yourself
i know i am quite myself
and the man we have in hiding down the river is estella s father
chapter li what purpose i had in view when i was hot on tracing out and proving estella s parentage i cannot say
it will presently be seen that the question was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before me by a wiser head than my own
but when herbert and i had held our momentous conversation i was seized with a feverish conviction that i ought to hunt the matter down that i ought not to let it rest but that i ought to see mr jaggers and come at the bare truth
i really do not know whether i felt that i did this for estella s sake or whether i was glad to transfer to the man in whose preservation i was so much concerned some rays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me
perhaps the latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth
any way i could scarcely be withheld from going out to gerrard street that night
herbert s representations that if i did i should probably be laid up and stricken useless when our fugitive s safety would depend upon me alone restrained my impatience
on the understanding again and again reiterated that come what would i was to go to mr jaggers to morrow i at length submitted to keep quiet and to have my hurts looked after and to stay at home
early next morning we went out together and at the corner of giltspur street by smithfield i left herbert to go his way into the city and took my way to little britain
there were periodical occasions when mr jaggers and wemmick went over the office accounts and checked off the vouchers and put all things straight
on these occasions wemmick took his books and papers into mr jaggers s room and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the outer office
finding such clerk on wemmick s post that morning i knew what was going on but i was not sorry to have mr jaggers and wemmick together as wemmick would then hear for himself that i said nothing to compromise him
my appearance with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders favored my object
although i had sent mr jaggers a brief account of the accident as soon as i had arrived in town yet i had to give him all the details now and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk to be less dry and hard and less strictly regulated by the rules of evidence than it had been before
while i described the disaster mr jaggers stood according to his wont before the fire
wemmick leaned back in his chair staring at me with his hands in the pockets of his trousers and his pen put horizontally into the post
the two brutal casts always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn t smell fire at the present moment
my narrative finished and their questions exhausted i then produced miss havisham s authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for herbert
mr jaggers s eyes retired a little deeper into his head when i handed him the tablets but he presently handed them over to wemmick with instructions to draw the check for his signature
while that was in course of being done i looked on at wemmick as he wrote and mr jaggers poising and swaying himself on his well polished boots looked on at me
i am sorry pip said he as i put the check in my pocket when he had signed it that we do nothing for you
miss havisham was good enough to ask me i returned whether she could do nothing for me and i told her no
everybody should know his own business said mr jaggers
and i saw wemmick s lips form the words portable property
i should not have told her no if i had been you said mr jaggers but every man ought to know his own business best
every man s business said wemmick rather reproachfully towards me is portable property
as i thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme i had at heart i said turning on mr jaggers i did ask something of miss havisham however sir
i asked her to give me some information relative to her adopted daughter and she gave me all she possessed
did she
said mr jaggers bending forward to look at his boots and then straightening himself
hah
i don t think i should have done so if i had been miss havisham
but she ought to know her own business best
i know more of the history of miss havisham s adopted child than miss havisham herself does sir
i know her mother
mr jaggers looked at me inquiringly and repeated mother
i have seen her mother within these three days
yes
said mr jaggers
and so have you sir
and you have seen her still more recently
yes
said mr jaggers
perhaps i know more of estella s history than even you do said i
i know her father too
a certain stop that mr jaggers came to in his manner he was too self possessed to change his manner but he could not help its being brought to an indefinably attentive stop assured me that he did not know who her father was
this i had strongly suspected from provis s account as herbert had repeated it of his having kept himself dark which i pieced on to the fact that he himself was not mr jaggers s client until some four years later and when he could have no reason for claiming his identity
but i could not be sure of this unconsciousness on mr jaggers s part before though i was quite sure of it now
so
you know the young lady s father pip
said mr jaggers
yes i replied and his name is provis from new south wales
even mr jaggers started when i said those words
it was the slightest start that could escape a man the most carefully repressed and the sooner checked but he did start though he made it a part of the action of taking out his pocket handkerchief
how wemmick received the announcement i am unable to say for i was afraid to look at him just then lest mr jaggers s sharpness should detect that there had been some communication unknown to him between us
and on what evidence pip asked mr jaggers very coolly as he paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose does provis make this claim
he does not make it said i and has never made it and has no knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence
for once the powerful pocket handkerchief failed
my reply was so unexpected that mr jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket without completing the usual performance folded his arms and looked with stern attention at me though with an immovable face
then i told him all i knew and how i knew it with the one reservation that i left him to infer that i knew from miss havisham what i in fact knew from wemmick
i was very careful indeed as to that
nor did i look towards wemmick until i had finished all i had to tell and had been for some time silently meeting mr jaggers s look
when i did at last turn my eyes in wemmick s direction i found that he had unposted his pen and was intent upon the table before him
hah
said mr jaggers at last as he moved towards the papers on the table
what item was it you were at wemmick when mr pip came in
but i could not submit to be thrown off in that way and i made a passionate almost an indignant appeal to him to be more frank and manly with me
i reminded him of the false hopes into which i had lapsed the length of time they had lasted and the discovery i had made and i hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits
i represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from him in return for the confidence i had just now imparted
i said that i did not blame him or suspect him or mistrust him but i wanted assurance of the truth from him
and if he asked me why i wanted it and why i thought i had any right to it i would tell him little as he cared for such poor dreams that i had loved estella dearly and long and that although i had lost her and must live a bereaved life whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything else in the world
and seeing that mr jaggers stood quite still and silent and apparently quite obdurate under this appeal i turned to wemmick and said wemmick i know you to be a man with a gentle heart
i have seen your pleasant home and your old father and all the innocent cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business life
and i entreat you to say a word for me to mr jaggers and to represent to him that all circumstances considered he ought to be more open with me
i have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than mr jaggers and wemmick did after this apostrophe
at first a misgiving crossed me that wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his employment but it melted as i saw mr jaggers relax into something like a smile and wemmick become bolder
what s all this
said mr jaggers
you with an old father and you with pleasant and playful ways
well
returned wemmick
if i don t bring em here what does it matter
pip said mr jaggers laying his hand upon my arm and smiling openly this man must be the most cunning impostor in all london
not a bit of it returned wemmick growing bolder and bolder
i think you re another
again they exchanged their former odd looks each apparently still distrustful that the other was taking him in
you with a pleasant home
said mr jaggers
since it don t interfere with business returned wemmick let it be so
now i look at you sir i shouldn t wonder if you might be planning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days when you re tired of all this work
mr jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times and actually drew a sigh
pip said he we won t talk about poor dreams you know more about such things than i having much fresher experience of that kind
but now about this other matter
i ll put a case to you
mind
i admit nothing
he waited for me to declare that i quite understood that he expressly said that he admitted nothing
now pip said mr jaggers put this case
put the case that a woman under such circumstances as you have mentioned held her child concealed and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser on his representing to her that he must know with an eye to the latitude of his defence how the fact stood about that child
put the case that at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up
i follow you sir
put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil and that all he saw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain destruction
put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at a criminal bar where they were held up to be seen put the case that he habitually knew of their being imprisoned whipped transported neglected cast out qualified in all ways for the hangman and growing up to be hanged
put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn to develop into the fish that were to come to his net to be prosecuted defended forsworn made orphans bedevilled somehow
i follow you sir
put the case pip that here was one pretty little child out of the heap who could be saved whom the father believed dead and dared make no stir about as to whom over the mother the legal adviser had this power i know what you did and how you did it
you came so and so you did such and such things to divert suspicion
i have tracked you through it all and i tell it you all
part with the child unless it should be necessary to produce it to clear you and then it shall be produced
give the child into my hands and i will do my best to bring you off
if you are saved your child is saved too if you are lost your child is still saved
put the case that this was done and that the woman was cleared
i understand you perfectly
but that i make no admissions
that you make no admissions
and wemmick repeated no admissions
put the case pip that passion and the terror of death had a little shaken the woman s intellects and that when she was set at liberty she was scared out of the ways of the world and went to him to be sheltered
put the case that he took her in and that he kept down the old wild violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking out by asserting his power over her in the old way
do you comprehend the imaginary case
quite
put the case that the child grew up and was married for money
that the mother was still living
that the father was still living
that the mother and father unknown to one another were dwelling within so many miles furlongs yards if you like of one another
that the secret was still a secret except that you had got wind of it
put that last case to yourself very carefully
i do
i ask wemmick to put it to himself very carefully
and wemmick said i do
for whose sake would you reveal the secret
for the father s
i think he would not be much the better for the mother
for the mother s
i think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was
for the daughter s
i think it would hardly serve her to establish her parentage for the information of her husband and to drag her back to disgrace after an escape of twenty years pretty secure to last for life
but add the case that you had loved her pip and had made her the subject of those poor dreams which have at one time or another been in the heads of more men than you think likely then i tell you that you had better and would much sooner when you had thought well of it chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand and then pass the chopper on to wemmick there to cut that off too
i looked at wemmick whose face was very grave
he gravely touched his lips with his forefinger
i did the same
mr jaggers did the same
now wemmick said the latter then resuming his usual manner what item was it you were at when mr pip came in
standing by for a little while they were at work i observed that the odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times with this difference now that each of them seemed suspicious not to say conscious of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to the other
for this reason i suppose they were now inflexible with one another mr jaggers being highly dictatorial and wemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for a moment
i had never seen them on such ill terms for generally they got on very well indeed together
but they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of mike the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his sleeve whom i had seen on the very first day of my appearance within those walls
this individual who either in his own person or in that of some member of his family seemed to be always in trouble which in that place meant newgate called to announce that his eldest daughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting
as he imparted this melancholy circumstance to wemmick mr jaggers standing magisterially before the fire and taking no share in the proceedings mike s eye happened to twinkle with a tear
what are you about
demanded wemmick with the utmost indignation
what do you come snivelling here for
i didn t go to do it mr
wemmick
you did said wemmick
how dare you
you re not in a fit state to come here if you can t come here without spluttering like a bad pen
what do you mean by it
a man can t help his feelings mr wemmick pleaded mike
his what
demanded wemmick quite savagely
say that again
now look here my man said mr jaggers advancing a step and pointing to the door
get out of this office
i ll have no feelings here
get out
it serves you right said wemmick get out
so the unfortunate mike very humbly withdrew and mr jaggers and wemmick appeared to have re established their good understanding and went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had just had lunch
chapter lii from little britain i went with my check in my pocket to miss skiffins s brother the accountant and miss skiffins s brother the accountant going straight to clarriker s and bringing clarriker to me i had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement
it was the only good thing i had done and the only completed thing i had done since i was first apprised of my great expectations
clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the house were steadily progressing that he would now be able to establish a small branch house in the east which was much wanted for the extension of the business and that herbert in his new partnership capacity would go out and take charge of it i found that i must have prepared for a separation from my friend even though my own affairs had been more settled
and now indeed i felt as if my last anchor were loosening its hold and i should soon be driving with the winds and waves
but there was recompense in the joy with which herbert would come home of a night and tell me of these changes little imagining that he told me no news and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting clara barley to the land of the arabian nights and of me going out to join them with a caravan of camels i believe and of our all going up the nile and seeing wonders
without being sanguine as to my own part in those bright plans i felt that herbert s way was clearing fast and that old bill barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum and his daughter would soon be happily provided for
we had now got into the month of march
my left arm though it presented no bad symptoms took in the natural course so long to heal that i was still unable to get a coat on
my right arm was tolerably restored disfigured but fairly serviceable
on a monday morning when herbert and i were at breakfast i received the following letter from wemmick by the post
walworth
burn this as soon as read
early in the week or say wednesday you might do what you know of if you felt disposed to try it
now burn
when i had shown this to herbert and had put it in the fire but not before we had both got it by heart we considered what to do
for of course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view
i have thought it over again and again said herbert and i think i know a better course than taking a thames waterman
take startop
a good fellow a skilled hand fond of us and enthusiastic and honorable
i had thought of him more than once
but how much would you tell him herbert
it is necessary to tell him very little
let him suppose it a mere freak but a secret one until the morning comes then let him know that there is urgent reason for your getting provis aboard and away
you go with him
no doubt
where
it had seemed to me in the many anxious considerations i had given the point almost indifferent what port we made for hamburg rotterdam antwerp the place signified little so that he was out of england
any foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do
i had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the boat certainly well beyond gravesend which was a critical place for search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot
as foreign steamers would leave london at about the time of high water our plan would be to get down the river by a previous ebb tide and lie by in some quiet spot until we could pull off to one
the time when one would be due where we lay wherever that might be could be calculated pretty nearly if we made inquiries beforehand
herbert assented to all this and we went out immediately after breakfast to pursue our investigations
we found that a steamer for hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best and we directed our thoughts chiefly to that vessel
but we noted down what other foreign steamers would leave london with the same tide and we satisfied ourselves that we knew the build and color of each
we then separated for a few hours i to get at once such passports as were necessary herbert to see startop at his lodgings
we both did what we had to do without any hindrance and when we met again at one o clock reported it done
i for my part was prepared with passports herbert had seen startop and he was more than ready to join
those two should pull a pair of oars we settled and i would steer our charge would be sitter and keep quiet as speed was not our object we should make way enough
we arranged that herbert should not come home to dinner before going to mill pond bank that evening that he should not go there at all to morrow evening tuesday that he should prepare provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house on wednesday when he saw us approach and not sooner that all the arrangements with him should be concluded that monday night and that he should be communicated with no more in any way until we took him on board
these precautions well understood by both of us i went home
on opening the outer door of our chambers with my key i found a letter in the box directed to me a very dirty letter though not ill written
it had been delivered by hand of course since i left home and its contents were these if you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to night or to morrow night at nine and to come to the little sluice house by the limekiln you had better come
if you want information regarding your uncle provis you had much better come and tell no one and lose no time
you must come alone
bring this with you
i had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange letter
what to do now i could not tell
and the worst was that i must decide quickly or i should miss the afternoon coach which would take me down in time for to night
to morrow night i could not think of going for it would be too close upon the time of the flight
and again for anything i knew the proffered information might have some important bearing on the flight itself
if i had had ample time for consideration i believe i should still have gone
having hardly any time for consideration my watch showing me that the coach started within half an hour i resolved to go
i should certainly not have gone but for the reference to my uncle provis
that coming on wemmick s letter and the morning s busy preparation turned the scale
it is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost any letter in a violent hurry that i had to read this mysterious epistle again twice before its injunction to me to be secret got mechanically into my mind
yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of way i left a note in pencil for herbert telling him that as i should be so soon going away i knew not for how long i had decided to hurry down and back to ascertain for myself how miss havisham was faring
i had then barely time to get my great coat lock up the chambers and make for the coach office by the short by ways
if i had taken a hackney chariot and gone by the streets i should have missed my aim going as i did i caught the coach just as it came out of the yard
i was the only inside passenger jolting away knee deep in straw when i came to myself
for i really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter it had so bewildered me ensuing on the hurry of the morning
the morning hurry and flutter had been great for long and anxiously as i had waited for wemmick his hint had come like a surprise at last
and now i began to wonder at myself for being in the coach and to doubt whether i had sufficient reason for being there and to consider whether i should get out presently and go back and to argue against ever heeding an anonymous communication and in short to pass through all those phases of contradiction and indecision to which i suppose very few hurried people are strangers
still the reference to provis by name mastered everything
i reasoned as i had reasoned already without knowing it if that be reasoning in case any harm should befall him through my not going how could i ever forgive myself
it was dark before we got down and the journey seemed long and dreary to me who could see little of it inside and who could not go outside in my disabled state
avoiding the blue boar i put up at an inn of minor reputation down the town and ordered some dinner
while it was preparing i went to satis house and inquired for miss havisham she was still very ill though considered something better
my inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house and i dined in a little octagonal common room like a font
as i was not able to cut my dinner the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for me
this bringing us into conversation he was so good as to entertain me with my own story of course with the popular feature that pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes
do you know the young man
said i
know him
repeated the landlord
ever since he was no height at all
does he ever come back to this neighborhood
ay he comes back said the landlord to his great friends now and again and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him
what man is that
him that i speak of said the landlord
mr
pumblechook
is he ungrateful to no one else
no doubt he would be if he could returned the landlord but he can t
and why
because pumblechook done everything for him
does pumblechook say so
say so
replied the landlord
he han t no call to say so
but does he say so
it would turn a man s blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of it sir said the landlord
i thought yet joe dear joe you never tell of it
long suffering and loving joe you never complain
nor you sweet tempered biddy
your appetite s been touched like by your accident said the landlord glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat
try a tenderer bit
no thank you i replied turning from the table to brood over the fire
i can eat no more
please take it away
i had never been struck at so keenly for my thanklessness to joe as through the brazen impostor pumblechook
the falser he the truer joe the meaner he the nobler joe
my heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as i mused over the fire for an hour or more
the striking of the clock aroused me but not from my dejection or remorse and i got up and had my coat fastened round my neck and went out
i had previously sought in my pockets for the letter that i might refer to it again but i could not find it and was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of the coach
i knew very well however that the appointed place was the little sluice house by the limekiln on the marshes and the hour nine
towards the marshes i now went straight having no time to spare
chapter liii it was a dark night though the full moon rose as i left the enclosed lands and passed out upon the marshes
beyond their dark line there was a ribbon of clear sky hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon
in a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field in among the piled mountains of cloud
there was a melancholy wind and the marshes were very dismal
a stranger would have found them insupportable and even to me they were so oppressive that i hesitated half inclined to go back
but i knew them well and could have found my way on a far darker night and had no excuse for returning being there
so having come there against my inclination i went on against it
the direction that i took was not that in which my old home lay nor that in which we had pursued the convicts
my back was turned towards the distant hulks as i walked on and though i could see the old lights away on the spits of sand i saw them over my shoulder
i knew the limekiln as well as i knew the old battery but they were miles apart so that if a light had been burning at each point that night there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright specks
at first i had to shut some gates after me and now and then to stand still while the cattle that were lying in the banked up pathway arose and blundered down among the grass and reeds
but after a little while i seemed to have the whole flats to myself
it was another half hour before i drew near to the kiln
the lime was burning with a sluggish stifling smell but the fires were made up and left and no workmen were visible
hard by was a small stone quarry
it lay directly in my way and had been worked that day as i saw by the tools and barrows that were lying about
coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation for the rude path lay through it i saw a light in the old sluice house
i quickened my pace and knocked at the door with my hand
waiting for some reply i looked about me noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken and how the house of wood with a tiled roof would not be proof against the weather much longer if it were so even now and how the mud and ooze were coated with lime and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a ghostly way towards me
still there was no answer and i knocked again
no answer still and i tried the latch
it rose under my hand and the door yielded
looking in i saw a lighted candle on a table a bench and a mattress on a truckle bedstead
as there was a loft above i called is there any one here
but no voice answered
then i looked at my watch and finding that it was past nine called again is there any one here
there being still no answer i went out at the door irresolute what to do
it was beginning to rain fast
seeing nothing save what i had seen already i turned back into the house and stood just within the shelter of the doorway looking out into the night
while i was considering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back or the candle would not be burning it came into my head to look if the wick were long
i turned round to do so and had taken up the candle in my hand when it was extinguished by some violent shock and the next thing i comprehended was that i had been caught in a strong running noose thrown over my head from behind
now said a suppressed voice with an oath i ve got you
what is this
i cried struggling
who is it
help help help
not only were my arms pulled close to my sides but the pressure on my bad arm caused me exquisite pain
sometimes a strong man s hand sometimes a strong man s breast was set against my mouth to deaden my cries and with a hot breath always close to me i struggled ineffectually in the dark while i was fastened tight to the wall
and now said the suppressed voice with another oath call out again and i ll make short work of you
faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm bewildered by the surprise and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in execution i desisted and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little
but it was bound too tight for that
i felt as if having been burnt before it were now being boiled
the sudden exclusion of the night and the substitution of black darkness in its place warned me that the man had closed a shutter
after groping about for a little he found the flint and steel he wanted and began to strike a light
i strained my sight upon the sparks that fell among the tinder and upon which he breathed and breathed match in hand but i could only see his lips and the blue point of the match even those but fitfully
the tinder was damp no wonder there and one after another the sparks died out
the man was in no hurry and struck again with the flint and steel
as the sparks fell thick and bright about him i could see his hands and touches of his face and could make out that he was seated and bending over the table but nothing more
presently i saw his blue lips again breathing on the tinder and then a flare of light flashed up and showed me orlick
whom i had looked for i don t know
i had not looked for him
seeing him i felt that i was in a dangerous strait indeed and i kept my eyes upon him
he lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation and dropped the match and trod it out
then he put the candle away from him on the table so that he could see me and sat with his arms folded on the table and looked at me
i made out that i was fastened to a stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall a fixture there the means of ascent to the loft above
now said he when we had surveyed one another for some time i ve got you
unbind me
let me go
ah
he returned i ll let you go
i ll let you go to the moon i ll let you go to the stars
all in good time
why have you lured me here
don t you know
said he with a deadly look
why have you set upon me in the dark
because i mean to do it all myself
one keeps a secret better than two
o you enemy you enemy
his enjoyment of the spectacle i furnished as he sat with his arms folded on the table shaking his head at me and hugging himself had a malignity in it that made me tremble
as i watched him in silence he put his hand into the corner at his side and took up a gun with a brass bound stock
do you know this
said he making as if he would take aim at me
do you know where you saw it afore
speak wolf
yes i answered
you cost me that place
you did
speak
what else could i do
you did that and that would be enough without more
how dared you to come betwixt me and a young woman i liked
when did i
when didn t you
it was you as always give old orlick a bad name to her
you gave it to yourself you gained it for yourself
i could have done you no harm if you had done yourself none
you re a liar
and you ll take any pains and spend any money to drive me out of this country will you
said he repeating my words to biddy in the last interview i had with her
now i ll tell you a piece of information
it was never so well worth your while to get me out of this country as it is to night
ah
if it was all your money twenty times told to the last brass farden
as he shook his heavy hand at me with his mouth snarling like a tiger s i felt that it was true
what are you going to do to me
i m a going said he bringing his fist down upon the table with a heavy blow and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force i m a going to have your life
he leaned forward staring at me slowly unclenched his hand and drew it across his mouth as if his mouth watered for me and sat down again
you was always in old orlick s way since ever you was a child
you goes out of his way this present night
he ll have no more on you
you re dead
i felt that i had come to the brink of my grave
for a moment i looked wildly round my trap for any chance of escape but there was none
more than that said he folding his arms on the table again i won t have a rag of you i won t have a bone of you left on earth
i ll put your body in the kiln i d carry two such to it on my shoulders and let people suppose what they may of you they shall never know nothing
my mind with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences of such a death
estella s father would believe i had deserted him would be taken would die accusing me even herbert would doubt me when he compared the letter i had left for him with the fact that i had called at miss havisham s gate for only a moment joe and biddy would never know how sorry i had been that night none would ever know what i had suffered how true i had meant to be what an agony i had passed through
the death close before me was terrible but far more terrible than death was the dread of being misremembered after death
and so quick were my thoughts that i saw myself despised by unborn generations estella s children and their children while the wretch s words were yet on his lips
now wolf said he afore i kill you like any other beast which is wot i mean to do and wot i have tied you up for i ll have a good look at you and a good goad at you
o you enemy
it had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again though few could know better than i the solitary nature of the spot and the hopelessness of aid
but as he sat gloating over me i was supported by a scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips
above all things i resolved that i would not entreat him and that i would die making some last poor resistance to him
softened as my thoughts of all the rest of men were in that dire extremity humbly beseeching pardon as i did of heaven melted at heart as i was by the thought that i had taken no farewell and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to me or could explain myself to them or ask for their compassion on my miserable errors still if i could have killed him even in dying i would have done it
he had been drinking and his eyes were red and bloodshot
around his neck was slung a tin bottle as i had often seen his meat and drink slung about him in other days
he brought the bottle to his lips and took a fiery drink from it and i smelt the strong spirits that i saw flash into his face
wolf
said he folding his arms again old orlick s a going to tell you somethink
it was you as did for your shrew sister
again my mind with its former inconceivable rapidity had exhausted the whole subject of the attack upon my sister her illness and her death before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words
it was you villain said i
i tell you it was your doing i tell you it was done through you he retorted catching up the gun and making a blow with the stock at the vacant air between us
i come upon her from behind as i come upon you to night
i giv it her
i left her for dead and if there had been a limekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you she shouldn t have come to life again
but it warn t old orlick as did it it was you
you was favored and he was bullied and beat
old orlick bullied and beat eh
now you pays for it
you done it now you pays for it
he drank again and became more ferocious
i saw by his tilting of the bottle that there was no great quantity left in it
i distinctly understood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an end of me
i knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life
i knew that when i was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards me but a little while before like my own warning ghost he would do as he had done in my sister s case make all haste to the town and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses
my rapid mind pursued him to the town made a picture of the street with him in it and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white vapor creeping over it into which i should have dissolved
it was not only that i could have summed up years and years and years while he said a dozen words but that what he did say presented pictures to me and not mere words
in the excited and exalted state of my brain i could not think of a place without seeing it or of persons without seeing them
it is impossible to overstate the vividness of these images and yet i was so intent all the time upon him himself who would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring that i knew of the slightest action of his fingers
when he had drunk this second time he rose from the bench on which he sat and pushed the table aside
then he took up the candle and shading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me stood before me looking at me and enjoying the sight
wolf i ll tell you something more
it was old orlick as you tumbled over on your stairs that night
i saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps
i saw the shadows of the heavy stair rails thrown by the watchman s lantern on the wall
i saw the rooms that i was never to see again here a door half open there a door closed all the articles of furniture around
and why was old orlick there
i ll tell you something more wolf
you and her have pretty well hunted me out of this country so far as getting a easy living in it goes and i ve took up with new companions and new masters
some of em writes my letters when i wants em wrote do you mind writes my letters wolf
they writes fifty hands they re not like sneaking you as writes but one
i ve had a firm mind and a firm will to have your life since you was down here at your sister s burying
i han t seen a way to get you safe and i ve looked arter you to know your ins and outs
for says old orlick to himself somehow or another i ll have him
what
when i looks for you i finds your uncle provis eh
mill pond bank and chinks s basin and the old green copper rope walk all so clear and plain
provis in his rooms the signal whose use was over pretty clara the good motherly woman old bill barley on his back all drifting by as on the swift stream of my life fast running out to sea
you with a uncle too
why i know d you at gargery s when you was so small a wolf that i could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and thumb and chucked you away dead as i d thoughts o doing odd times when i see you loitering amongst the pollards on a sunday and you hadn t found no uncles then
no not you
but when old orlick come for to hear that your uncle provis had most like wore the leg iron wot old orlick had picked up filed asunder on these meshes ever so many year ago and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it like a bullock as he means to drop you hey when he come for to hear that hey
in his savage taunting he flared the candle so close at me that i turned my face aside to save it from the flame
ah
he cried laughing after doing it again the burnt child dreads the fire
old orlick knowed you was burnt old orlick knowed you was smuggling your uncle provis away old orlick s a match for you and know d you d come to night
now i ll tell you something more wolf and this ends it
there s them that s as good a match for your uncle provis as old orlick has been for you
let him ware them when he s lost his nevvy
let him ware them when no man can t find a rag of his dear relation s clothes nor yet a bone of his body
there s them that can t and that won t have magwitch yes i know the name alive in the same land with them and that s had such sure information of him when he was alive in another land as that he couldn t and shouldn t leave it unbeknown and put them in danger
p raps it s them that writes fifty hands and that s not like sneaking you as writes but one
ware compeyson magwitch and the gallows
he flared the candle at me again smoking my face and hair and for an instant blinding me and turned his powerful back as he replaced the light on the table
i had thought a prayer and had been with joe and biddy and herbert before he turned towards me again
there was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite wall
within this space he now slouched backwards and forwards
his great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever before as he did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his sides and with his eyes scowling at me
i had no grain of hope left
wild as my inward hurry was and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me instead of thoughts i could yet clearly understand that unless he had resolved that i was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all human knowledge he would never have told me what he had told
of a sudden he stopped took the cork out of his bottle and tossed it away
light as it was i heard it fall like a plummet
he swallowed slowly tilting up the bottle by little and little and now he looked at me no more
the last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of his hand and licked up
then with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing horribly he threw the bottle from him and stooped and i saw in his hand a stone hammer with a long heavy handle
the resolution i had made did not desert me for without uttering one vain word of appeal to him i shouted out with all my might and struggled with all my might
it was only my head and my legs that i could move but to that extent i struggled with all the force until then unknown that was within me
in the same instant i heard responsive shouts saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door heard voices and tumult and saw orlick emerge from a struggle of men as if it were tumbling water clear the table at a leap and fly out into the night
after a blank i found that i was lying unbound on the floor in the same place with my head on some one s knee
my eyes were fixed on the ladder against the wall when i came to myself had opened on it before my mind saw it and thus as i recovered consciousness i knew that i was in the place where i had lost it
too indifferent at first even to look round and ascertain who supported me i was lying looking at the ladder when there came between me and it a face
the face of trabb s boy
i think he s all right
said trabb s boy in a sober voice but ain t he just pale though
at these words the face of him who supported me looked over into mine and i saw my supporter to be herbert
great heaven
softly said herbert
gently handel
don t be too eager
and our old comrade startop
i cried as he too bent over me
remember what he is going to assist us in said herbert and be calm
the allusion made me spring up though i dropped again from the pain in my arm
the time has not gone by herbert has it
what night is to night
how long have i been here
for i had a strange and strong misgiving that i had been lying there a long time a day and a night two days and nights more
the time has not gone by
it is still monday night
thank god
and you have all to morrow tuesday to rest in said herbert
but you can t help groaning my dear handel
what hurt have you got
can you stand
yes yes said i i can walk
i have no hurt but in this throbbing arm
they laid it bare and did what they could
it was violently swollen and inflamed and i could scarcely endure to have it touched
but they tore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages and carefully replaced it in the sling until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling lotion to put upon it
in a little while we had shut the door of the dark and empty sluice house and were passing through the quarry on our way back
trabb s boy trabb s overgrown young man now went before us with a lantern which was the light i had seen come in at the door
but the moon was a good two hours higher than when i had last seen the sky and the night though rainy was much lighter
the white vapor of the kiln was passing from us as we went by and as i had thought a prayer before i thought a thanksgiving now
entreating herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue which at first he had flatly refused to do but had insisted on my remaining quiet i learnt that i had in my hurry dropped the letter open in our chambers where he coming home to bring with him startop whom he had met in the street on his way to me found it very soon after i was gone
its tone made him uneasy and the more so because of the inconsistency between it and the hasty letter i had left for him
his uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding after a quarter of an hour s consideration he set off for the coach office with startop who volunteered his company to make inquiry when the next coach went down
finding that the afternoon coach was gone and finding that his uneasiness grew into positive alarm as obstacles came in his way he resolved to follow in a post chaise
so he and startop arrived at the blue boar fully expecting there to find me or tidings of me but finding neither went on to miss havisham s where they lost me
hereupon they went back to the hotel doubtless at about the time when i was hearing the popular local version of my own story to refresh themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes
among the loungers under the boar s archway happened to be trabb s boy true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no business and trabb s boy had seen me passing from miss havisham s in the direction of my dining place
thus trabb s boy became their guide and with him they went out to the sluice house though by the town way to the marshes which i had avoided
now as they went along herbert reflected that i might after all have been brought there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to provis s safety and bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous left his guide and startop on the edge of the quarry and went on by himself and stole round the house two or three times endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within
as he could hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice this was while my mind was so busy he even at last began to doubt whether i was there when suddenly i cried out loudly and he answered the cries and rushed in closely followed by the other two
when i told herbert what had passed within the house he was for our immediately going before a magistrate in the town late at night as it was and getting out a warrant
but i had already considered that such a course by detaining us there or binding us to come back might be fatal to provis
there was no gainsaying this difficulty and we relinquished all thoughts of pursuing orlick at that time
for the present under the circumstances we deemed it prudent to make rather light of the matter to trabb s boy who i am convinced would have been much affected by disappointment if he had known that his intervention saved me from the limekiln
not that trabb s boy was of a malignant nature but that he had too much spare vivacity and that it was in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody s expense
when we parted i presented him with two guineas which seemed to meet his views and told him that i was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of him which made no impression on him at all
wednesday being so close upon us we determined to go back to london that night three in the post chaise the rather as we should then be clear away before the night s adventure began to be talked of
herbert got a large bottle of stuff for my arm and by dint of having this stuff dropped over it all the night through i was just able to bear its pain on the journey
it was daylight when we reached the temple and i went at once to bed and lay in bed all day
my terror as i lay there of falling ill and being unfitted for to morrow was so besetting that i wonder it did not disable me of itself
it would have done so pretty surely in conjunction with the mental wear and tear i had suffered but for the unnatural strain upon me that to morrow was
so anxiously looked forward to charged with such consequences its results so impenetrably hidden though so near
no precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from communication with him that day yet this again increased my restlessness
i started at every footstep and every sound believing that he was discovered and taken and this was the messenger to tell me so
i persuaded myself that i knew he was taken that there was something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment that the fact had occurred and i had a mysterious knowledge of it
as the days wore on and no ill news came as the day closed in and darkness fell my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to morrow morning altogether mastered me
my burning arm throbbed and my burning head throbbed and i fancied i was beginning to wander
i counted up to high numbers to make sure of myself and repeated passages that i knew in prose and verse
it happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a fatigued mind i dozed for some moments or forgot then i would say to myself with a start now it has come and i am turning delirious
they kept me very quiet all day and kept my arm constantly dressed and gave me cooling drinks
whenever i fell asleep i awoke with the notion i had had in the sluice house that a long time had elapsed and the opportunity to save him was gone
about midnight i got out of bed and went to herbert with the conviction that i had been asleep for four and twenty hours and that wednesday was past
it was the last self exhausting effort of my fretfulness for after that i slept soundly
wednesday morning was dawning when i looked out of window
the winking lights upon the bridges were already pale the coming sun was like a marsh of fire on the horizon
the river still dark and mysterious was spanned by bridges that were turning coldly gray with here and there at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky
as i looked along the clustered roofs with church towers and spires shooting into the unusually clear air the sun rose up and a veil seemed to be drawn from the river and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters
from me too a veil seemed to be drawn and i felt strong and well
herbert lay asleep in his bed and our old fellow student lay asleep on the sofa
i could not dress myself without help but i made up the fire which was still burning and got some coffee ready for them
in good time they too started up strong and well and we admitted the sharp morning air at the windows and looked at the tide that was still flowing towards us
when it turns at nine o clock said herbert cheerfully look out for us and stand ready you over there at mill pond bank
chapter liv it was one of those march days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold when it is summer in the light and winter in the shade
we had our pea coats with us and i took a bag
of all my worldly possessions i took no more than the few necessaries that filled the bag
where i might go what i might do or when i might return were questions utterly unknown to me nor did i vex my mind with them for it was wholly set on provis s safety
i only wondered for the passing moment as i stopped at the door and looked back under what altered circumstances i should next see those rooms if ever
we loitered down to the temple stairs and stood loitering there as if we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all
of course i had taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order
after a little show of indecision which there were none to see but the two or three amphibious creatures belonging to our temple stairs we went on board and cast off herbert in the bow i steering
it was then about high water half past eight
our plan was this
the tide beginning to run down at nine and being with us until three we intended still to creep on after it had turned and row against it until dark
we should then be well in those long reaches below gravesend between kent and essex where the river is broad and solitary where the water side inhabitants are very few and where lone public houses are scattered here and there of which we could choose one for a resting place
there we meant to lie by all night
the steamer for hamburg and the steamer for rotterdam would start from london at about nine on thursday morning
we should know at what time to expect them according to where we were and would hail the first so that if by any accident we were not taken abroad we should have another chance
we knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel
the relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was so great to me that i felt it difficult to realize the condition in which i had been a few hours before
the crisp air the sunlight the movement on the river and the moving river itself the road that ran with us seeming to sympathize with us animate us and encourage us on freshened me with new hope
i felt mortified to be of so little use in the boat but there were few better oarsmen than my two friends and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day
at that time the steam traffic on the thames was far below its present extent and watermen s boats were far more numerous
of barges sailing colliers and coasting traders there were perhaps as many as now but of steam ships great and small not a tithe or a twentieth part so many
early as it was there were plenty of scullers going here and there that morning and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide the navigation of the river between bridges in an open boat was a much easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these and we went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly
old london bridge was soon passed and old billingsgate market with its oyster boats and dutchmen and the white tower and traitor s gate and we were in among the tiers of shipping
here were the leith aberdeen and glasgow steamers loading and unloading goods and looking immensely high out of the water as we passed alongside here were colliers by the score and score with the coal whippers plunging off stages on deck as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up which were then rattled over the side into barges here at her moorings was to morrow s steamer for rotterdam of which we took good notice and here to morrow s for hamburg under whose bowsprit we crossed
and now i sitting in the stern could see with a faster beating heart mill pond bank and mill pond stairs
is he there
said herbert
not yet
right
he was not to come down till he saw us
can you see his signal
not well from here but i think i see it now i see him
pull both
easy herbert
oars
we touched the stairs lightly for a single moment and he was on board and we were off again
he had a boat cloak with him and a black canvas bag and he looked as like a river pilot as my heart could have wished
dear boy
he said putting his arm on my shoulder as he took his seat
faithful dear boy well done
thankye thankye
again among the tiers of shipping in and out avoiding rusty chain cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys sinking for the moment floating broken baskets scattering floating chips of wood and shaving cleaving floating scum of coal in and out under the figure head of the john of sunderland making a speech to the winds as is done by many johns and the betsy of yarmouth with a firm formality of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her head in and out hammers going in ship builders yards saws going at timber clashing engines going at things unknown pumps going in leaky ships capstans going ships going out to sea and unintelligible sea creatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lightermen in and out out at last upon the clearer river where the ships boys might take their fenders in no longer fishing in troubled waters with them over the side and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind
at the stairs where we had taken him abroad and ever since i had looked warily for any token of our being suspected
i had seen none
we certainly had not been and at that time as certainly we were not either attended or followed by any boat
if we had been waited on by any boat i should have run in to shore and have obliged her to go on or to make her purpose evident
but we held our own without any appearance of molestation
he had his boat cloak on him and looked as i have said a natural part of the scene
it was remarkable but perhaps the wretched life he had led accounted for it that he was the least anxious of any of us
he was not indifferent for he told me that he hoped to live to see his gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country he was not disposed to be passive or resigned as i understood it but he had no notion of meeting danger half way
when it came upon him he confronted it but it must come before he troubled himself
if you knowed dear boy he said to me what it is to sit here alonger my dear boy and have my smoke arter having been day by day betwixt four walls you d envy me
but you don t know what it is
i think i know the delights of freedom i answered
ah said he shaking his head gravely
but you don t know it equal to me
you must have been under lock and key dear boy to know it equal to me but i ain t a going to be low
it occurred to me as inconsistent that for any mastering idea he should have endangered his freedom and even his life
but i reflected that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man
i was not far out since he said after smoking a little you see dear boy when i was over yonder t other side the world i was always a looking to this side and it come flat to be there for all i was a growing rich
everybody knowed magwitch and magwitch could come and magwitch could go and nobody s head would be troubled about him
they ain t so easy concerning me here dear boy wouldn t be leastwise if they knowed where i was
if all goes well said i you will be perfectly free and safe again within a few hours
well he returned drawing a long breath i hope so
and think so
he dipped his hand in the water over the boat s gunwale and said smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me ay i s pose i think so dear boy
we d be puzzled to be more quiet and easy going than we are at present
but it s a flowing so soft and pleasant through the water p raps as makes me think it i was a thinking through my smoke just then that we can no more see to the bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river what i catches hold of
nor yet we can t no more hold their tide than i can hold this
and it s run through my fingers and gone you see
holding up his dripping hand
but for your face i should think you were a little despondent said i
not a bit on it dear boy
it comes of flowing on so quiet and of that there rippling at the boat s head making a sort of a sunday tune
maybe i m a growing a trifle old besides
he put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of face and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of england
yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been in constant terror for when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer into the boat and he was stepping out i hinted that i thought he would be safest where he was and he said
do you dear boy
and quietly sat down again
the air felt cold upon the river but it was a bright day and the sunshine was very cheering
the tide ran strong i took care to lose none of it and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well
by imperceptible degrees as the tide ran out we lost more and more of the nearer woods and hills and dropped lower and lower between the muddy banks but the tide was yet with us when we were off gravesend
as our charge was wrapped in his cloak i purposely passed within a boat or two s length of the floating custom house and so out to catch the stream alongside of two emigrant ships and under the bows of a large transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us
and soon the tide began to slacken and the craft lying at anchor to swing and presently they had all swung round and the ships that were taking advantage of the new tide to get up to the pool began to crowd upon us in a fleet and we kept under the shore as much out of the strength of the tide now as we could standing carefully off from low shallows and mudbanks
our oarsmen were so fresh by dint of having occasionally let her drive with the tide for a minute or two that a quarter of an hour s rest proved full as much as they wanted
we got ashore among some slippery stones while we ate and drank what we had with us and looked about
it was like my own marsh country flat and monotonous and with a dim horizon while the winding river turned and turned and the great floating buoys upon it turned and turned and everything else seemed stranded and still
for now the last of the fleet of ships was round the last low point we had headed and the last green barge straw laden with a brown sail had followed and some ballast lighters shaped like a child s first rude imitation of a boat lay low in the mud and a little squat shoal lighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud and slimy stones stuck out of the mud and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud and an old landing stage and an old roofless building slipped into the mud and all about us was stagnation and mud
we pushed off again and made what way we could
it was much harder work now but herbert and startop persevered and rowed and rowed and rowed until the sun went down
by that time the river had lifted us a little so that we could see above the bank
there was the red sun on the low level of the shore in a purple haze fast deepening into black and there was the solitary flat marsh and far away there were the rising grounds between which and us there seemed to be no life save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull
as the night was fast falling and as the moon being past the full would not rise early we held a little council a short one for clearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find
so they plied their oars once more and i looked out for anything like a house
thus we held on speaking little for four or five dull miles
it was very cold and a collier coming by us with her galley fire smoking and flaring looked like a comfortable home
the night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning and what light we had seemed to come more from the river than the sky as the oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars
at this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we were followed
as the tide made it flapped heavily at irregular intervals against the shore and whenever such a sound came one or other of us was sure to start and look in that direction
here and there the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little creek and we were all suspicious of such places and eyed them nervously
sometimes what was that ripple
one of us would say in a low voice
or another is that a boat yonder
and afterwards we would fall into a dead silence and i would sit impatiently thinking with what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels
at length we descried a light and a roof and presently afterwards ran alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard by
leaving the rest in the boat i stepped ashore and found the light to be in a window of a public house
it was a dirty place enough and i dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers but there was a good fire in the kitchen and there were eggs and bacon to eat and various liquors to drink
also there were two double bedded rooms such as they were the landlord said
no other company was in the house than the landlord his wife and a grizzled male creature the jack of the little causeway who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been low water mark too
with this assistant i went down to the boat again and we all came ashore and brought out the oars and rudder and boat hook and all else and hauled her up for the night
we made a very good meal by the kitchen fire and then apportioned the bedrooms herbert and startop were to occupy one i and our charge the other
we found the air as carefully excluded from both as if air were fatal to life and there were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than i should have thought the family possessed
but we considered ourselves well off notwithstanding for a more solitary place we could not have found
while we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal the jack who was sitting in a corner and who had a bloated pair of shoes on which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon as interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of a drowned seaman washed ashore asked me if we had seen a four oared galley going up with the tide
when i told him no he said she must have gone down then and yet she took up too when she left there
they must ha thought better on t for some reason or another said the jack and gone down
a four oared galley did you say
said i
a four said the jack and two sitters
did they come ashore here
they put in with a stone two gallon jar for some beer
i d ha been glad to pison the beer myself said the jack or put some rattling physic in it
why
i know why said the jack
he spoke in a slushy voice as if much mud had washed into his throat
he thinks said the landlord a weakly meditative man with a pale eye who seemed to rely greatly on his jack he thinks they was what they wasn t
i knows what i thinks observed the jack
you thinks custum us jack
said the landlord
i do said the jack
then you re wrong jack
am i
in the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in his views the jack took one of his bloated shoes off looked into it knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor and put it on again
he did this with the air of a jack who was so right that he could afford to do anything
why what do you make out that they done with their buttons then jack
asked the landlord vacillating weakly
done with their buttons
returned the jack
chucked em overboard
swallered em
sowed em to come up small salad
done with their buttons
don t be cheeky jack remonstrated the landlord in a melancholy and pathetic way
a custum us officer knows what to do with his buttons said the jack repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt when they comes betwixt him and his own light
a four and two sitters don t go hanging and hovering up with one tide and down with another and both with and against another without there being custum us at the bottom of it
saying which he went out in disdain and the landlord having no one to reply upon found it impracticable to pursue the subject
this dialogue made us all uneasy and me very uneasy
the dismal wind was muttering round the house the tide was flapping at the shore and i had a feeling that we were caged and threatened
a four oared galley hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly circumstance that i could not get rid of
when i had induced provis to go up to bed i went outside with my two companions startop by this time knew the state of the case and held another council
whether we should remain at the house until near the steamer s time which would be about one in the afternoon or whether we should put off early in the morning was the question we discussed
on the whole we deemed it the better course to lie where we were until within an hour or so of the steamer s time and then to get out in her track and drift easily with the tide
having settled to do this we returned into the house and went to bed
i lay down with the greater part of my clothes on and slept well for a few hours
when i awoke the wind had risen and the sign of the house the ship was creaking and banging about with noises that startled me
rising softly for my charge lay fast asleep i looked out of the window
it commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat and as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon i saw two men looking into her
they passed by under the window looking at nothing else and they did not go down to the landing place which i could discern to be empty but struck across the marsh in the direction of the nore
my first impulse was to call up herbert and show him the two men going away
but reflecting before i got into his room which was at the back of the house and adjoined mine that he and startop had had a harder day than i and were fatigued i forbore
going back to my window i could see the two men moving over the marsh
in that light however i soon lost them and feeling very cold lay down to think of the matter and fell asleep again
we were up early
as we walked to and fro all four together before breakfast i deemed it right to recount what i had seen
again our charge was the least anxious of the party
it was very likely that the men belonged to the custom house he said quietly and that they had no thought of us
i tried to persuade myself that it was so as indeed it might easily be
however i proposed that he and i should walk away together to a distant point we could see and that the boat should take us aboard there or as near there as might prove feasible at about noon
this being considered a good precaution soon after breakfast he and i set forth without saying anything at the tavern
he smoked his pipe as we went along and sometimes stopped to clap me on the shoulder
one would have supposed that it was i who was in danger not he and that he was reassuring me
we spoke very little
as we approached the point i begged him to remain in a sheltered place while i went on to reconnoitre for it was towards it that the men had passed in the night
he complied and i went on alone
there was no boat off the point nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it nor were there any signs of the men having embarked there
but to be sure the tide was high and there might have been some footpints under water
when he looked out from his shelter in the distance and saw that i waved my hat to him to come up he rejoined me and there we waited sometimes lying on the bank wrapped in our coats and sometimes moving about to warm ourselves until we saw our boat coming round
we got aboard easily and rowed out into the track of the steamer
by that time it wanted but ten minutes of one o clock and we began to look out for her smoke
but it was half past one before we saw her smoke and soon afterwards we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer
as they were coming on at full speed we got the two bags ready and took that opportunity of saying good bye to herbert and startop
we had all shaken hands cordially and neither herbert s eyes nor mine were quite dry when i saw a four oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way ahead of us and row out into the same track
a stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer s smoke by reason of the bend and wind of the river but now she was visible coming head on
i called to herbert and startop to keep before the tide that she might see us lying by for her and i adjured provis to sit quite still wrapped in his cloak
he answered cheerily trust to me dear boy and sat like a statue
meantime the galley which was very skilfully handled had crossed us let us come up with her and fallen alongside
leaving just room enough for the play of the oars she kept alongside drifting when we drifted and pulling a stroke or two when we pulled
of the two sitters one held the rudder lines and looked at us attentively as did all the rowers the other sitter was wrapped up much as provis was and seemed to shrink and whisper some instruction to the steerer as he looked at us
not a word was spoken in either boat
startop could make out after a few minutes which steamer was first and gave me the word hamburg in a low voice as we sat face to face
she was nearing us very fast and the beating of her peddles grew louder and louder
i felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us when the galley hailed us
i answered
you have a returned transport there said the man who held the lines
that s the man wrapped in the cloak
his name is abel magwitch otherwise provis
i apprehend that man and call upon him to surrender and you to assist
at the same moment without giving any audible direction to his crew he ran the galley abroad of us
they had pulled one sudden stroke ahead had got their oars in had run athwart us and were holding on to our gunwale before we knew what they were doing
this caused great confusion on board the steamer and i heard them calling to us and heard the order given to stop the paddles and heard them stop but felt her driving down upon us irresistibly
in the same moment i saw the steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner s shoulder and saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide and saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite frantically
still in the same moment i saw the prisoner start up lean across his captor and pull the cloak from the neck of the shrinking sitter in the galley
still in the same moment i saw that the face disclosed was the face of the other convict of long ago
still in the same moment i saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it that i shall never forget and heard a great cry on board the steamer and a loud splash in the water and felt the boat sink from under me
it was but for an instant that i seemed to struggle with a thousand mill weirs and a thousand flashes of light that instant past i was taken on board the galley
herbert was there and startop was there but our boat was gone and the two convicts were gone
what with the cries aboard the steamer and the furious blowing off of her steam and her driving on and our driving on i could not at first distinguish sky from water or shore from shore but the crew of the galley righted her with great speed and pulling certain swift strong strokes ahead lay upon their oars every man looking silently and eagerly at the water astern
presently a dark object was seen in it bearing towards us on the tide
no man spoke but the steersman held up his hand and all softly backed water and kept the boat straight and true before it
as it came nearer i saw it to be magwitch swimming but not swimming freely
he was taken on board and instantly manacled at the wrists and ankles
the galley was kept steady and the silent eager look out at the water was resumed
but the rotterdam steamer now came up and apparently not understanding what had happened came on at speed
by the time she had been hailed and stopped both steamers were drifting away from us and we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water
the look out was kept long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone but everybody knew that it was hopeless now
at length we gave it up and pulled under the shore towards the tavern we had lately left where we were received with no little surprise
here i was able to get some comforts for magwitch provis no longer who had received some very severe injury in the chest and a deep cut in the head
he told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the steamer and to have been struck on the head in rising
the injury to his chest which rendered his breathing extremely painful he thought he had received against the side of the galley
he added that he did not pretend to say what he might or might not have done to compeyson but that in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him that villain had staggered up and staggered back and they had both gone overboard together when the sudden wrenching of him magwitch out of our boat and the endeavor of his captor to keep him in it had capsized us
he told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in each other s arms and that there had been a struggle under water and that he had disengaged himself struck out and swum away
i never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me
the officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going overboard
when i asked this officer s permission to change the prisoner s wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments i could get at the public house he gave it readily merely observing that he must take charge of everything his prisoner had about him
so the pocket book which had once been in my hands passed into the officer s
he further gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to london but declined to accord that grace to my two friends
the jack at the ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone down and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was likeliest to come ashore
his interest in its recovery seemed to me to be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on
probably it took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely and that may have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in various stages of decay
we remained at the public house until the tide turned and then magwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board
herbert and startop were to get to london by land as soon as they could
we had a doleful parting and when i took my place by magwitch s side i felt that that was my place henceforth while he lived
for now my repugnance to him had all melted away and in the hunted wounded shackled creature who held my hand in his i only saw a man who had meant to be my benefactor and who had felt affectionately gratefully and generously towards me with great constancy through a series of years
i only saw in him a much better man than i had been to joe
his breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on and often he could not repress a groan
i tried to rest him on the arm i could use in any easy position but it was dreadful to think that i could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt since it was unquestionably best that he should die
that there were still living people enough who were able and willing to identify him i could not doubt
that he would be leniently treated i could not hope
he who had been presented in the worst light at his trial who had since broken prison and had been tried again who had returned from transportation under a life sentence and who had occasioned the death of the man who was the cause of his arrest
as we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back i told him how grieved i was to think that he had come home for my sake
dear boy he answered i m quite content to take my chance
i ve seen my boy and he can be a gentleman without me
no
i had thought about that while we had been there side by side
no
apart from any inclinations of my own i understood wemmick s hint now
i foresaw that being convicted his possessions would be forfeited to the crown
lookee here dear boy said he it s best as a gentleman should not be knowed to belong to me now
only come to see me as if you come by chance alonger wemmick
sit where i can see you when i am swore to for the last o many times and i don t ask no more
i will never stir from your side said i when i am suffered to be near you
please god i will be as true to you as you have been to me
i felt his hand tremble as it held mine and he turned his face away as he lay in the bottom of the boat and i heard that old sound in his throat softened now like all the rest of him
it was a good thing that he had touched this point for it put into my mind what i might not otherwise have thought of until too late that he need never know how his hopes of enriching me had perished
chapter lv he was taken to the police court next day and would have been immediately committed for trial but that it was necessary to send down for an old officer of the prison ship from which he had once escaped to speak to his identity
nobody doubted it but compeyson who had meant to depose to it was tumbling on the tides dead and it happened that there was not at that time any prison officer in london who could give the required evidence
i had gone direct to mr jaggers at his private house on my arrival over night to retain his assistance and mr jaggers on the prisoner s behalf would admit nothing
it was the sole resource for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes when the witness was there and that no power on earth could prevent its going against us
i imparted to mr jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the fate of his wealth
mr jaggers was querulous and angry with me for having let it slip through my fingers and said we must memorialize by and by and try at all events for some of it
but he did not conceal from me that although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture would not be exacted there were no circumstances in this case to make it one of them
i understood that very well
i was not related to the outlaw or connected with him by any recognizable tie he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favor before his apprehension and to do so now would be idle
i had no claim and i finally resolved and ever afterwards abided by the resolution that my heart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one
there appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture and had obtained some accurate knowledge of magwitch s affairs
when his body was found many miles from the scene of his death and so horribly disfigured that he was only recognizable by the contents of his pockets notes were still legible folded in a case he carried
among these were the name of a banking house in new south wales where a sum of money was and the designation of certain lands of considerable value
both these heads of information were in a list that magwitch while in prison gave to mr jaggers of the possessions he supposed i should inherit
his ignorance poor fellow at last served him he never mistrusted but that my inheritance was quite safe with mr jaggers s aid
after three days delay during which the crown prosecution stood over for the production of the witness from the prison ship the witness came and completed the easy case
he was committed to take his trial at the next sessions which would come on in a month
it was at this dark time of my life that herbert returned home one evening a good deal cast down and said my dear handel i fear i shall soon have to leave you
his partner having prepared me for that i was less surprised than he thought
we shall lose a fine opportunity if i put off going to cairo and i am very much afraid i must go handel when you most need me
herbert i shall always need you because i shall always love you but my need is no greater now than at another time
you will be so lonely
i have not leisure to think of that said i
you know that i am always with him to the full extent of the time allowed and that i should be with him all day long if i could
and when i come away from him you know that my thoughts are with him
the dreadful condition to which he was brought was so appalling to both of us that we could not refer to it in plainer words
my dear fellow said herbert let the near prospect of our separation for it is very near be my justification for troubling you about yourself
have you thought of your future
no for i have been afraid to think of any future
but yours cannot be dismissed indeed my dear dear handel it must not be dismissed
i wish you would enter on it now as far as a few friendly words go with me
i will said i
in this branch house of ours handel we must have a i saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word so i said a clerk
a clerk
and i hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand as a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded into a partner
now handel in short my dear boy will you come to me
there was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in which after saying now handel as if it were the grave beginning of a portentous business exordium he had suddenly given up that tone stretched out his honest hand and spoken like a schoolboy
clara and i have talked about it again and again herbert pursued and the dear little thing begged me only this evening with tears in her eyes to say to you that if you will live with us when we come together she will do her best to make you happy and to convince her husband s friend that he is her friend too
we should get on so well handel
i thanked her heartily and i thanked him heartily but said i could not yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered
firstly my mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly
secondly yes
secondly there was a vague something lingering in my thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative
but if you thought herbert that you could without doing any injury to your business leave the question open for a little while for any while cried herbert
six months a year
not so long as that said i
two or three months at most
herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must go away at the end of the week
and clara
said i
the dear little thing returned herbert holds dutifully to her father as long as he lasts but he won t last long
mrs whimple confides to me that he is certainly going
not to say an unfeeling thing said i he cannot do better than go
i am afraid that must be admitted said herbert and then i shall come back for the dear little thing and the dear little thing and i will walk quietly into the nearest church
remember
the blessed darling comes of no family my dear handel and never looked into the red book and hasn t a notion about her grandpapa
what a fortune for the son of my mother
on the saturday in that same week i took my leave of herbert full of bright hope but sad and sorry to leave me as he sat on one of the seaport mail coaches
i went into a coffee house to write a little note to clara telling her he had gone off sending his love to her over and over again and then went to my lonely home if it deserved the name for it was now no home to me and i had no home anywhere
on the stairs i encountered wemmick who was coming down after an unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door
i had not seen him alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight and he had come in his private and personal capacity to say a few words of explanation in reference to that failure
the late compeyson said wemmick had by little and little got at the bottom of half of the regular business now transacted and it was from the talk of some of his people in trouble some of his people being always in trouble that i heard what i did
i kept my ears open seeming to have them shut until i heard that he was absent and i thought that would be the best time for making the attempt
i can only suppose now that it was a part of his policy as a very clever man habitually to deceive his own instruments
you don t blame me i hope mr pip
i am sure i tried to serve you with all my heart
i am as sure of that wemmick as you can be and i thank you most earnestly for all your interest and friendship
thank you thank you very much
it s a bad job said wemmick scratching his head and i assure you i haven t been so cut up for a long time
what i look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property
dear me
what i think of wemmick is the poor owner of the property
yes to be sure said wemmick
of course there can be no objection to your being sorry for him and i d put down a five pound note myself to get him out of it
but what i look at is this
the late compeyson having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return and being so determined to bring him to book i do not think he could have been saved
whereas the portable property certainly could have been saved
that s the difference between the property and the owner don t you see
i invited wemmick to come upstairs and refresh himself with a glass of grog before walking to walworth
he accepted the invitation
while he was drinking his moderate allowance he said with nothing to lead up to it and after having appeared rather fidgety what do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on monday mr
pip
why i suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months
these twelve years more likely said wemmick
yes
i m going to take a holiday
more than that i m going to take a walk
more than that i m going to ask you to take a walk with me
i was about to excuse myself as being but a bad companion just then when wemmick anticipated me
i know your engagements said he and i know you are out of sorts mr pip
but if you could oblige me i should take it as a kindness
it ain t a long walk and it s an early one
say it might occupy you including breakfast on the walk from eight to twelve
couldn t you stretch a point and manage it
he had done so much for me at various times that this was very little to do for him
i said i could manage it would manage it and he was so very much pleased by my acquiescence that i was pleased too
at his particular request i appointed to call for him at the castle at half past eight on monday morning and so we parted for the time
punctual to my appointment i rang at the castle gate on the monday morning and was received by wemmick himself who struck me as looking tighter than usual and having a sleeker hat on
within there were two glasses of rum and milk prepared and two biscuits
the aged must have been stirring with the lark for glancing into the perspective of his bedroom i observed that his bed was empty
when we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits and were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us i was considerably surprised to see wemmick take up a fishing rod and put it over his shoulder
why we are not going fishing
said i
no returned wemmick but i like to walk with one
i thought this odd however i said nothing and we set off
we went towards camberwell green and when we were thereabouts wemmick said suddenly halloa
here s a church
there was nothing very surprising in that but again i was rather surprised when he said as if he were animated by a brilliant idea let s go in
we went in wemmick leaving his fishing rod in the porch and looked all round
in the mean time wemmick was diving into his coat pockets and getting something out of paper there
halloa
said he
here s a couple of pair of gloves
let s put em on
as the gloves were white kid gloves and as the post office was widened to its utmost extent i now began to have my strong suspicions
they were strengthened into certainty when i beheld the aged enter at a side door escorting a lady
halloa
said wemmick
here s miss skiffins
let s have a wedding
that discreet damsel was attired as usual except that she was now engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white
the aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the altar of hymen
the old gentleman however experienced so much difficulty in getting his gloves on that wemmick found it necessary to put him with his back against a pillar and then to get behind the pillar himself and pull away at them while i for my part held the old gentleman round the waist that he might present an equal and safe resistance
by dint of this ingenious scheme his gloves were got on to perfection
the clerk and clergyman then appearing we were ranged in order at those fatal rails
true to his notion of seeming to do it all without preparation i heard wemmick say to himself as he took something out of his waistcoat pocket before the service began halloa
here s a ring
i acted in the capacity of backer or best man to the bridegroom while a little limp pew opener in a soft bonnet like a baby s made a feint of being the bosom friend of miss skiffins
the responsibility of giving the lady away devolved upon the aged which led to the clergyman s being unintentionally scandalized and it happened thus
when he said who giveth this woman to be married to this man
the old gentleman not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments
upon which the clergyman said again who giveth this woman to be married to this man
the old gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice now aged p you know who giveth
to which the aged replied with great briskness before saying that he gave all right john all right my boy
and the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon it that i had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely married that day
it was completely done however and when we were going out of church wemmick took the cover off the font and put his white gloves in it and put the cover on again
mrs wemmick more heedful of the future put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green
now mr pip said wemmick triumphantly shouldering the fishing rod as we came out let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a wedding party
breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern a mile or so away upon the rising ground beyond the green and there was a bagatelle board in the room in case we should desire to unbend our minds after the solemnity
it was pleasant to observe that mrs wemmick no longer unwound wemmick s arm when it adapted itself to her figure but sat in a high backed chair against the wall like a violoncello in its case and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done
we had an excellent breakfast and when any one declined anything on table wemmick said provided by contract you know don t be afraid of it
i drank to the new couple drank to the aged drank to the castle saluted the bride at parting and made myself as agreeable as i could
wemmick came down to the door with me and i again shook hands with him and wished him joy
thankee
said wemmick rubbing his hands
she s such a manager of fowls you have no idea
you shall have some eggs and judge for yourself
i say mr
pip
calling me back and speaking low
this is altogether a walworth sentiment please
i understand
not to be mentioned in little britain said i wemmick nodded
after what you let out the other day mr jaggers may as well not know of it
he might think my brain was softening or something of the kind
chapter lvi he lay in prison very ill during the whole interval between his committal for trial and the coming round of the sessions
he had broken two ribs they had wounded one of his lungs and he breathed with great pain and difficulty which increased daily
it was a consequence of his hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible therefore he spoke very little
but he was ever ready to listen to me and it became the first duty of my life to say to him and read to him what i knew he ought to hear
being far too ill to remain in the common prison he was removed after the first day or so into the infirmary
this gave me opportunities of being with him that i could not otherwise have had
and but for his illness he would have been put in irons for he was regarded as a determined prison breaker and i know not what else
although i saw him every day it was for only a short time hence the regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state
i do not recollect that i once saw any change in it for the better he wasted and became slowly weaker and worse day by day from the day when the prison door closed upon him
the kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man who was tired out
i sometimes derived an impression from his manner or from a whispered word or two which escaped him that he pondered over the question whether he might have been a better man under better circumstances
but he never justified himself by a hint tending that way or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape
it happened on two or three occasions in my presence that his desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on him
a smile crossed his face then and he turned his eyes on me with a trustful look as if he were confident that i had seen some small redeeming touch in him even so long ago as when i was a little child
as to all the rest he was humble and contrite and i never knew him complain
when the sessions came round mr jaggers caused an application to be made for the postponement of his trial until the following sessions
it was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long and was refused
the trial came on at once and when he was put to the bar he was seated in a chair
no objection was made to my getting close to the dock on the outside of it and holding the hand that he stretched forth to me
the trial was very short and very clear
such things as could be said for him were said how he had taken to industrious habits and had thriven lawfully and reputably
but nothing could unsay the fact that he had returned and was there in presence of the judge and jury
it was impossible to try him for that and do otherwise than find him guilty
at that time it was the custom as i learnt from my terrible experience of that sessions to devote a concluding day to the passing of sentences and to make a finishing effect with the sentence of death
but for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me i could scarcely believe even as i write these words that i saw two and thirty men and women put before the judge to receive that sentence together
foremost among the two and thirty was he seated that he might get breath enough to keep life in him
the whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment down to the drops of april rain on the windows of the court glittering in the rays of april sun
penned in the dock as i again stood outside it at the corner with his hand in mine were the two and thirty men and women some defiant some stricken with terror some sobbing and weeping some covering their faces some staring gloomily about
there had been shrieks from among the women convicts but they had been stilled and a hush had succeeded
the sheriffs with their great chains and nosegays other civic gewgaws and monsters criers ushers a great gallery full of people a large theatrical audience looked on as the two and thirty and the judge were solemnly confronted
then the judge addressed them
among the wretched creatures before him whom he must single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had been an offender against the laws who after repeated imprisonments and punishments had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years and who under circumstances of great violence and daring had made his escape and been re sentenced to exile for life
that miserable man would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors when far removed from the scenes of his old offences and to have lived a peaceable and honest life
but in a fatal moment yielding to those propensities and passions the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to society he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance and had come back to the country where he was proscribed
being here presently denounced he had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of justice but being at length seized while in the act of flight he had resisted them and had he best knew whether by express design or in the blindness of his hardihood caused the death of his denouncer to whom his whole career was known
the appointed punishment for his return to the land that had cast him out being death and his case being this aggravated case he must prepare himself to die
the sun was striking in at the great windows of the court through the glittering drops of rain upon the glass and it made a broad shaft of light between the two and thirty and the judge linking both together and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on with absolute equality to the greater judgment that knoweth all things and cannot err
rising for a moment a distinct speck of face in this way of light the prisoner said my lord i have received my sentence of death from the almighty but i bow to yours and sat down again
there was some hushing and the judge went on with what he had to say to the rest
then they were all formally doomed and some of them were supported out and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of bravery and a few nodded to the gallery and two or three shook hands and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from the sweet herbs lying about
he went last of all because of having to be helped from his chair and to go very slowly and he held my hand while all the others were removed and while the audience got up putting their dresses right as they might at church or elsewhere and pointed down at this criminal or at that and most of all at him and me
i earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the recorder s report was made but in the dread of his lingering on i began that night to write out a petition to the home secretary of state setting forth my knowledge of him and how it was that he had come back for my sake
i wrote it as fervently and pathetically as i could and when i had finished it and sent it in i wrote out other petitions to such men in authority as i hoped were the most merciful and drew up one to the crown itself
for several days and nights after he was sentenced i took no rest except when i fell asleep in my chair but was wholly absorbed in these appeals
and after i had sent them in i could not keep away from the places where they were but felt as if they were more hopeful and less desperate when i was near them
in this unreasonable restlessness and pain of mind i would roam the streets of an evening wandering by those offices and houses where i had left the petitions
to the present hour the weary western streets of london on a cold dusty spring night with their ranges of stern shut up mansions and their long rows of lamps are melancholy to me from this association
the daily visits i could make him were shortened now and he was more strictly kept
seeing or fancying that i was suspected of an intention of carrying poison to him i asked to be searched before i sat down at his bedside and told the officer who was always there that i was willing to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my designs
nobody was hard with him or with me
there was duty to be done and it was done but not harshly
the officer always gave me the assurance that he was worse and some other sick prisoners in the room and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses malefactors but not incapable of kindness god be thanked
always joined in the same report
as the days went on i noticed more and more that he would lie placidly looking at the white ceiling with an absence of light in his face until some word of mine brightened it for an instant and then it would subside again
sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak then he would answer me with slight pressures on my hand and i grew to understand his meaning very well
the number of the days had risen to ten when i saw a greater change in him than i had seen yet
his eyes were turned towards the door and lighted up as i entered
dear boy he said as i sat down by his bed i thought you was late
but i knowed you couldn t be that
it is just the time said i
i waited for it at the gate
you always waits at the gate don t you dear boy
yes
not to lose a moment of the time
thank ee dear boy thank ee
god bless you
you ve never deserted me dear boy
i pressed his hand in silence for i could not forget that i had once meant to desert him
and what s the best of all he said you ve been more comfortable alonger me since i was under a dark cloud than when the sun shone
that s best of all
he lay on his back breathing with great difficulty
do what he would and love me though he did the light left his face ever and again and a film came over the placid look at the white ceiling
are you in much pain to day
i don t complain of none dear boy
you never do complain
he had spoken his last words
he smiled and i understood his touch to mean that he wished to lift my hand and lay it on his breast
i laid it there and he smiled again and put both his hands upon it
the allotted time ran out while we were thus but looking round i found the governor of the prison standing near me and he whispered you needn t go yet
i thanked him gratefully and asked might i speak to him if he can hear me
the governor stepped aside and beckoned the officer away
the change though it was made without noise drew back the film from the placid look at the white ceiling and he looked most affectionately at me
dear magwitch i must tell you now at last
you understand what i say
a gentle pressure on my hand
you had a child once whom you loved and lost
a stronger pressure on my hand
she lived and found powerful friends
she is living now
she is a lady and very beautiful
and i love her
with a last faint effort which would have been powerless but for my yielding to it and assisting it he raised my hand to his lips
then he gently let it sink upon his breast again with his own hands lying on it
the placid look at the white ceiling came back and passed away and his head dropped quietly on his breast
mindful then of what we had read together i thought of the two men who went up into the temple to pray and i knew there were no better words that i could say beside his bed than o lord be merciful to him a sinner
chapter lvii now that i was left wholly to myself i gave notice of my intention to quit the chambers in the temple as soon as my tenancy could legally determine and in the meanwhile to underlet them
at once i put bills up in the windows for i was in debt and had scarcely any money and began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs
i ought rather to write that i should have been alarmed if i had had energy and concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth beyond the fact that i was falling very ill
the late stress upon me had enabled me to put off illness but not to put it away i knew that it was coming on me now and i knew very little else and was even careless as to that
for a day or two i lay on the sofa or on the floor anywhere according as i happened to sink down with a heavy head and aching limbs and no purpose and no power
then there came one night which appeared of great duration and which teemed with anxiety and horror and when in the morning i tried to sit up in my bed and think of it i found i could not do so
whether i really had been down in garden court in the dead of the night groping about for the boat that i supposed to be there whether i had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror not knowing how i had got out of bed whether i had found myself lighting the lamp possessed by the idea that he was coming up the stairs and that the lights were blown out whether i had been inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking laughing and groaning of some one and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of the room and a voice had called out over and over again that miss havisham was consuming within it these were things that i tried to settle with myself and get into some order as i lay that morning on my bed
but the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them disordering them all and it was through the vapor at last that i saw two men looking at me
what do you want
i asked starting i don t know you
well sir returned one of them bending down and touching me on the shoulder this is a matter that you ll soon arrange i dare say but you re arrested
what is the debt
hundred and twenty three pound fifteen six
jeweller s account i think
what is to be done
you had better come to my house said the man
i keep a very nice house
i made some attempt to get up and dress myself
when i next attended to them they were standing a little off from the bed looking at me
i still lay there
you see my state said i
i would come with you if i could but indeed i am quite unable
if you take me from here i think i shall die by the way
perhaps they replied or argued the point or tried to encourage me to believe that i was better than i thought
forasmuch as they hang in my memory by only this one slender thread i don t know what they did except that they forbore to remove me
that i had a fever and was avoided that i suffered greatly that i often lost my reason that the time seemed interminable that i confounded impossible existences with my own identity that i was a brick in the house wall and yet entreating to be released from the giddy place where the builders had set me that i was a steel beam of a vast engine clashing and whirling over a gulf and yet that i implored in my own person to have the engine stopped and my part in it hammered off that i passed through these phases of disease i know of my own remembrance and did in some sort know at the time
that i sometimes struggled with real people in the belief that they were murderers and that i would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good and would then sink exhausted in their arms and suffer them to lay me down i also knew at the time
but above all i knew that there was a constant tendency in all these people who when i was very ill would present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face and would be much dilated in size above all i say i knew that there was an extraordinary tendency in all these people sooner or later to settle down into the likeness of joe
after i had turned the worst point of my illness i began to notice that while all its other features changed this one consistent feature did not change
whoever came about me still settled down into joe
i opened my eyes in the night and i saw in the great chair at the bedside joe
i opened my eyes in the day and sitting on the window seat smoking his pipe in the shaded open window still i saw joe
i asked for cooling drink and the dear hand that gave it me was joe s
i sank back on my pillow after drinking and the face that looked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of joe
at last one day i took courage and said is it joe
and the dear old home voice answered which it air old chap
o joe you break my heart
look angry at me joe
strike me joe
tell me of my ingratitude
don t be so good to me
for joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side and put his arm round my neck in his joy that i knew him
which dear old pip old chap said joe you and me was ever friends
and when you re well enough to go out for a ride what larks
after which joe withdrew to the window and stood with his back towards me wiping his eyes
and as my extreme weakness prevented me from getting up and going to him i lay there penitently whispering o god bless him
o god bless this gentle christian man
joe s eyes were red when i next found him beside me but i was holding his hand and we both felt happy
how long dear joe
which you meantersay pip how long have your illness lasted dear old chap
yes joe
it s the end of may pip
to morrow is the first of june
and have you been here all that time dear joe
pretty nigh old chap
for as i says to biddy when the news of your being ill were brought by letter which it were brought by the post and being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal of walking and shoe leather but wealth were not a object on his part and marriage were the great wish of his hart it is so delightful to hear you joe
but i interrupt you in what you said to biddy
which it were said joe that how you might be amongst strangers and that how you and me having been ever friends a wisit at such a moment might not prove unacceptabobble
and biddy her word were go to him without loss of time
that said joe summing up with his judicial air were the word of biddy
go to him biddy say without loss of time
in short i shouldn t greatly deceive you joe added after a little grave reflection if i represented to you that the word of that young woman were without a minute s loss of time
there joe cut himself short and informed me that i was to be talked to in great moderation and that i was to take a little nourishment at stated frequent times whether i felt inclined for it or not and that i was to submit myself to all his orders
so i kissed his hand and lay quiet while he proceeded to indite a note to biddy with my love in it
evidently biddy had taught joe to write
as i lay in bed looking at him it made me in my weak state cry again with pleasure to see the pride with which he set about his letter
my bedstead divested of its curtains had been removed with me upon it into the sitting room as the airiest and largest and the carpet had been taken away and the room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day
at my own writing table pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles joe now sat down to his great work first choosing a pen from the pen tray as if it were a chest of large tools and tucking up his sleeves as if he were going to wield a crow bar or sledgehammer
it was necessary for joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow and to get his right leg well out behind him before he could begin and when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might have been six feet long while at every upstroke i could hear his pen spluttering extensively
he had a curious idea that the inkstand was on the side of him where it was not and constantly dipped his pen into space and seemed quite satisfied with the result
occasionally he was tripped up by some orthographical stumbling block but on the whole he got on very well indeed and when he had signed his name and had removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with his two forefingers he got up and hovered about the table trying the effect of his performance from various points of view as it lay there with unbounded satisfaction
not to make joe uneasy by talking too much even if i had been able to talk much i deferred asking him about miss havisham until next day
he shook his head when i then asked him if she had recovered
is she dead joe
why you see old chap said joe in a tone of remonstrance and by way of getting at it by degrees i wouldn t go so far as to say that for that s a deal to say but she ain t living joe
that s nigher where it is said joe she ain t living
did she linger long joe
arter you was took ill pretty much about what you might call if you was put to it a week said joe still determined on my account to come at everything by degrees
dear joe have you heard what becomes of her property
well old chap said joe it do appear that she had settled the most of it which i meantersay tied it up on miss estella
but she had wrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the accident leaving a cool four thousand to mr matthew pocket
and why do you suppose above all things pip she left that cool four thousand unto him
because of pip s account of him the said matthew
i am told by biddy that air the writing said joe repeating the legal turn as if it did him infinite good account of him the said matthew
and a cool four thousand pip
i never discovered from whom joe derived the conventional temperature of the four thousand pounds but it appeared to make the sum of money more to him and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool
this account gave me great joy as it perfected the only good thing i had done
i asked joe whether he had heard if any of the other relations had any legacies
miss sarah said joe she have twenty five pound perannium fur to buy pills on account of being bilious
miss georgiana she have twenty pound down
mrs what s the name of them wild beasts with humps old chap
camels
said i wondering why he could possibly want to know
joe nodded
mrs camels by which i presently understood he meant camilla she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in spirits when she wake up in the night
the accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me to give me great confidence in joe s information
and now said joe you ain t that strong yet old chap that you can take in more nor one additional shovelful to day
old orlick he s been a bustin open a dwelling ouse
whose
said i
not i grant you but what his manners is given to blusterous said joe apologetically still a englishman s ouse is his castle and castles must not be busted cept when done in war time
and wotsume er the failings on his part he were a corn and seedsman in his hart
is it pumblechook s house that has been broken into then
that s it pip said joe and they took his till and they took his cash box and they drinked his wine and they partook of his wittles and they slapped his face and they pulled his nose and they tied him up to his bedpust and they giv him a dozen and they stuffed his mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out
but he knowed orlick and orlick s in the county jail
by these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation
i was slow to gain strength but i did slowly and surely become less weak and joe stayed with me and i fancied i was little pip again
for the tenderness of joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need that i was like a child in his hands
he would sit and talk to me in the old confidence and with the old simplicity and in the old unassertive protecting way so that i would half believe that all my life since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that was gone
he did everything for me except the household work for which he had engaged a very decent woman after paying off the laundress on his first arrival
which i do assure you pip he would often say in explanation of that liberty i found her a tapping the spare bed like a cask of beer and drawing off the feathers in a bucket for sale
which she would have tapped yourn next and draw d it off with you a laying on it and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in the soup tureen and wegetable dishes and the wine and spirits in your wellington boots
we looked forward to the day when i should go out for a ride as we had once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship
and when the day came and an open carriage was got into the lane joe wrapped me up took me in his arms carried me down to it and put me in as if i were still the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of the wealth of his great nature
and joe got in beside me and we drove away together into the country where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass and sweet summer scents filled all the air
the day happened to be sunday and when i looked on the loveliness around me and thought how it had grown and changed and how the little wild flowers had been forming and the voices of the birds had been strengthening by day and by night under the sun and under the stars while poor i lay burning and tossing on my bed the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed there came like a check upon my peace
but when i heard the sunday bells and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty i felt that i was not nearly thankful enough that i was too weak yet to be even that and i laid my head on joe s shoulder as i had laid it long ago when he had taken me to the fair or where not and it was too much for my young senses
more composure came to me after a while and we talked as we used to talk lying on the grass at the old battery
there was no change whatever in joe
exactly what he had been in my eyes then he was in my eyes still just as simply faithful and as simply right
when we got back again and he lifted me out and carried me so easily across the court and up the stairs i thought of that eventful christmas day when he had carried me over the marshes
we had not yet made any allusion to my change of fortune nor did i know how much of my late history he was acquainted with
i was so doubtful of myself now and put so much trust in him that i could not satisfy myself whether i ought to refer to it when he did not
have you heard joe i asked him that evening upon further consideration as he smoked his pipe at the window who my patron was
i heerd returned joe as it were not miss havisham old chap
did you hear who it was joe
well
i heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv you the bank notes at the jolly bargemen pip
so it was
astonishing
said joe in the placidest way
did you hear that he was dead joe
i presently asked with increasing diffidence
which
him as sent the bank notes pip
yes
i think said joe after meditating a long time and looking rather evasively at the window seat as i did hear tell that how he were something or another in a general way in that direction
did you hear anything of his circumstances joe
not partickler pip
if you would like to hear joe i was beginning when joe got up and came to my sofa
lookee here old chap said joe bending over me
ever the best of friends ain t us pip
i was ashamed to answer him
wery good then said joe as if i had answered that s all right that s agreed upon
then why go into subjects old chap which as betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary
there s subjects enough as betwixt two sech without onnecessary ones
lord
to think of your poor sister and her rampages
and don t you remember tickler
i do indeed joe
lookee here old chap said joe
i done what i could to keep you and tickler in sunders but my power were not always fully equal to my inclinations
for when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you it were not so much said joe in his favorite argumentative way that she dropped into me too if i put myself in opposition to her but that she dropped into you always heavier for it
i noticed that
it ain t a grab at a man s whisker not yet a shake or two of a man to which your sister was quite welcome that ud put a man off from getting a little child out of punishment
but when that little child is dropped into heavier for that grab of whisker or shaking then that man naterally up and says to himself where is the good as you are a doing
i grant you i see the arm says the man but i don t see the good
i call upon you sir therefore to pint out the good
the man says
i observed as joe waited for me to speak
the man says joe assented
is he right that man
dear joe he is always right
well old chap said joe then abide by your words
if he s always right which in general he s more likely wrong he s right when he says this supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself when you was a little child you kep it mostly because you know d as j gargery s power to part you and tickler in sunders were not fully equal to his inclinations
theerfore think no more of it as betwixt two sech and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects
biddy giv herself a deal o trouble with me afore i left for i am almost awful dull as i should view it in this light and viewing it in this light as i should so put it
both of which said joe quite charmed with his logical arrangement being done now this to you a true friend say
namely
you mustn t go a overdoing on it but you must have your supper and your wine and water and you must be put betwixt the sheets
the delicacy with which joe dismissed this theme and the sweet tact and kindness with which biddy who with her woman s wit had found me out so soon had prepared him for it made a deep impression on my mind
but whether joe knew how poor i was and how my great expectations had all dissolved like our own marsh mists before the sun i could not understand
another thing in joe that i could not understand when it first began to develop itself but which i soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension of was this as i became stronger and better joe became a little less easy with me
in my weakness and entire dependence on him the dear fellow had fallen into the old tone and called me by the old names the dear old pip old chap that now were music in my ears
i too had fallen into the old ways only happy and thankful that he let me
but imperceptibly though i held by them fast joe s hold upon them began to slacken and whereas i wondered at this at first i soon began to understand that the cause of it was in me and that the fault of it was all mine
ah
had i given joe no reason to doubt my constancy and to think that in prosperity i should grow cold to him and cast him off
had i given joe s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as i got stronger his hold upon me would be weaker and that he had better loosen it in time and let me go before i plucked myself away
it was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the temple gardens leaning on joe s arm that i saw this change in him very plainly
we had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight looking at the river and i chanced to say as we got up see joe
i can walk quite strongly
now you shall see me walk back by myself
which do not overdo it pip said joe but i shall be happy fur to see you able sir
the last word grated on me but how could i remonstrate
i walked no further than the gate of the gardens and then pretended to be weaker than i was and asked joe for his arm
joe gave it me but was thoughtful
i for my part was thoughtful too for how best to check this growing change in joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts
that i was ashamed to tell him exactly how i was placed and what i had come down to i do not seek to conceal but i hope my reluctance was not quite an unworthy one
he would want to help me out of his little savings i knew and i knew that he ought not to help me and that i must not suffer him to do it
it was a thoughtful evening with both of us
but before we went to bed i had resolved that i would wait over to morrow to morrow being sunday and would begin my new course with the new week
on monday morning i would speak to joe about this change i would lay aside this last vestige of reserve i would tell him what i had in my thoughts that secondly not yet arrived at and why i had not decided to go out to herbert and then the change would be conquered for ever
as i cleared joe cleared and it seemed as though he had sympathetically arrived at a resolution too
we had a quiet day on the sunday and we rode out into the country and then walked in the fields
i feel thankful that i have been ill joe i said
dear old pip old chap you re a most come round sir
it has been a memorable time for me joe
likeways for myself sir joe returned
we have had a time together joe that i can never forget
there were days once i know that i did for a while forget but i never shall forget these
pip said joe appearing a little hurried and troubled there has been larks
and dear sir what have been betwixt us have been
at night when i had gone to bed joe came into my room as he had done all through my recovery
he asked me if i felt sure that i was as well as in the morning
yes dear joe quite
and are always a getting stronger old chap
yes dear joe steadily
joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand and said in what i thought a husky voice good night
when i got up in the morning refreshed and stronger yet i was full of my resolution to tell joe all without delay
i would tell him before breakfast
i would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him for it was the first day i had been up early
i went to his room and he was not there
not only was he not there but his box was gone
i hurried then to the breakfast table and on it found a letter
these were its brief contents not wishful to intrude i have departured fur you are well again dear pip and will do better without jo
p s
ever the best of friends
enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which i had been arrested
down to that moment i had vainly supposed that my creditor had withdrawn or suspended proceedings until i should be quite recovered
i had never dreamed of joe s having paid the money but joe had paid it and the receipt was in his name
what remained for me now but to follow him to the dear old forge and there to have out my disclosure to him and my penitent remonstrance with him and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved secondly which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts and had formed into a settled purpose
the purpose was that i would go to biddy that i would show her how humbled and repentant i came back that i would tell her how i had lost all i once hoped for that i would remind her of our old confidences in my first unhappy time
then i would say to her biddy i think you once liked me very well when my errant heart even while it strayed away from you was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since
if you can like me only half as well once more if you can take me with all my faults and disappointments on my head if you can receive me like a forgiven child and indeed i am as sorry biddy and have as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand i hope i am a little worthier of you that i was not much but a little
and biddy it shall rest with you to say whether i shall work at the forge with joe or whether i shall try for any different occupation down in this country or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which i set aside when it was offered until i knew your answer
and now dear biddy if you can tell me that you will go through the world with me you will surely make it a better world for me and me a better man for it and i will try hard to make it a better world for you
such was my purpose
after three days more of recovery i went down to the old place to put it in execution
and how i sped in it is all i have left to tell
chapter lviii the tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down to my native place and its neighborhood before i got there
i found the blue boar in possession of the intelligence and i found that it made a great change in the boar s demeanour
whereas the boar had cultivated my good opinion with warm assiduity when i was coming into property the boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that i was going out of property
it was evening when i arrived much fatigued by the journey i had so often made so easily
the boar could not put me into my usual bedroom which was engaged probably by some one who had expectations and could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and post chaises up the yard
but i had as sound a sleep in that lodging as in the most superior accommodation the boar could have given me and the quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom
early in the morning while my breakfast was getting ready i strolled round by satis house
there were printed bills on the gate and on bits of carpet hanging out of the windows announcing a sale by auction of the household furniture and effects next week
the house itself was to be sold as old building materials and pulled down
lot 1 was marked in whitewashed knock knee letters on the brew house lot 2 on that part of the main building which had been so long shut up
other lots were marked off on other parts of the structure and the ivy had been torn down to make room for the inscriptions and much of it trailed low in the dust and was withered already
stepping in for a moment at the open gate and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no business there i saw the auctioneer s clerk walking on the casks and telling them off for the information of a catalogue compiler pen in hand who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair i had so often pushed along to the tune of old clem
when i got back to my breakfast in the boar s coffee room i found mr pumblechook conversing with the landlord
mr pumblechook not improved in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure was waiting for me and addressed me in the following terms young man i am sorry to see you brought low
but what else could be expected
what else could be expected
as he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air and as i was broken by illness and unfit to quarrel i took it
william said mr pumblechook to the waiter put a muffin on table
and has it come to this
has it come to this
i frowningly sat down to my breakfast
mr pumblechook stood over me and poured out my tea before i could touch the teapot with the air of a benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last
william said mr pumblechook mournfully put the salt on
in happier times addressing me i think you took sugar
and did you take milk
you did
sugar and milk
william bring a watercress
thank you said i shortly but i don t eat watercresses
you don t eat em returned mr pumblechook sighing and nodding his head several times as if he might have expected that and as if abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall
true
the simple fruits of the earth
no
you needn t bring any william
i went on with my breakfast and mr pumblechook continued to stand over me staring fishily and breathing noisily as he always did
little more than skin and bone
mused mr pumblechook aloud
and yet when he went from here i may say with my blessing and i spread afore him my humble store like the bee he was as plump as a peach
this reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity saying may i
and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the same fat five fingers
hah
he went on handing me the bread and butter
and air you a going to joseph
in heaven s name said i firing in spite of myself what does it matter to you where i am going
leave that teapot alone
it was the worst course i could have taken because it gave pumblechook the opportunity he wanted
yes young man said he releasing the handle of the article in question retiring a step or two from my table and speaking for the behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door i will leave that teapot alone
you are right young man
for once you are right
i forgit myself when i take such an interest in your breakfast as to wish your frame exhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality to be stimilated by the olesome nourishment of your forefathers
and yet said pumblechook turning to the landlord and waiter and pointing me out at arm s length this is him as i ever sported with in his days of happy infancy
tell me not it cannot be i tell you this is him
a low murmur from the two replied
the waiter appeared to be particularly affected
this is him said pumblechook as i have rode in my shay cart
this is him as i have seen brought up by hand
this is him untoe the sister of which i was uncle by marriage as her name was georgiana m ria from her own mother let him deny it if he can
the waiter seemed convinced that i could not deny it and that it gave the case a black look
young man said pumblechook screwing his head at me in the old fashion you air a going to joseph
what does it matter to me you ask me where you air a going
i say to you sir you air a going to joseph
the waiter coughed as if he modestly invited me to get over that
now said pumblechook and all this with a most exasperating air of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and conclusive i will tell you what to say to joseph
here is squires of the boar present known and respected in this town and here is william which his father s name was potkins if i do not deceive myself
you do not sir said william
in their presence pursued pumblechook i will tell you young man what to say to joseph
says you joseph i have this day seen my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun s
i will name no names joseph but so they are pleased to call him up town and i have seen that man
i swear i don t see him here said i
say that likewise retorted pumblechook
say you said that and even joseph will probably betray surprise
there you quite mistake him said i
i know better
says you pumblechook went on joseph i have seen that man and that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice
he knows your character joseph and is well acquainted with your pig headedness and ignorance and he knows my character joseph and he knows my want of gratitoode
yes joseph says you here pumblechook shook his head and hand at me he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode
he knows it joseph as none can
you do not know it joseph having no call to know it but that man do
windy donkey as he was it really amazed me that he could have the face to talk thus to mine
says you joseph he gave me a little message which i will now repeat
it was that in my being brought low he saw the finger of providence
he knowed that finger when he saw joseph and he saw it plain
it pinted out this writing joseph
reward of ingratitoode to his earliest benefactor and founder of fortun s
but that man said he did not repent of what he had done joseph
not at all
it was right to do it it was kind to do it it was benevolent to do it and he would do it again
it s pity said i scornfully as i finished my interrupted breakfast that the man did not say what he had done and would do again
squires of the boar
pumblechook was now addressing the landlord and william
i have no objections to your mentioning either up town or down town if such should be your wishes that it was right to do it kind to do it benevolent to do it and that i would do it again
with those words the impostor shook them both by the hand with an air and left the house leaving me much more astonished than delighted by the virtues of that same indefinite it
i was not long after him in leaving the house too and when i went down the high street i saw him holding forth no doubt to the same effect at his shop door to a select group who honored me with very unfavorable glances as i passed on the opposite side of the way
but it was only the pleasanter to turn to biddy and to joe whose great forbearance shone more brightly than before if that could be contrasted with this brazen pretender
i went towards them slowly for my limbs were weak but with a sense of increasing relief as i drew nearer to them and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness further and further behind
the june weather was delicious
the sky was blue the larks were soaring high over the green corn i thought all that countryside more beautiful and peaceful by far than i had ever known it to be yet
many pleasant pictures of the life that i would lead there and of the change for the better that would come over my character when i had a guiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom i had proved beguiled my way
they awakened a tender emotion in me for my heart was softened by my return and such a change had come to pass that i felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel and whose wanderings had lasted many years
the schoolhouse where biddy was mistress i had never seen but the little roundabout lane by which i entered the village for quietness sake took me past it
i was disappointed to find that the day was a holiday no children were there and biddy s house was closed
some hopeful notion of seeing her busily engaged in her daily duties before she saw me had been in my mind and was defeated
but the forge was a very short distance off and i went towards it under the sweet green limes listening for the clink of joe s hammer
long after i ought to have heard it and long after i had fancied i heard it and found it but a fancy all was still
the limes were there and the white thorns were there and the chestnut trees were there and their leaves rustled harmoniously when i stopped to listen but the clink of joe s hammer was not in the midsummer wind
almost fearing without knowing why to come in view of the forge i saw it at last and saw that it was closed
no gleam of fire no glittering shower of sparks no roar of bellows all shut up and still
but the house was not deserted and the best parlor seemed to be in use for there were white curtains fluttering in its window and the window was open and gay with flowers
i went softly towards it meaning to peep over the flowers when joe and biddy stood before me arm in arm
at first biddy gave a cry as if she thought it was my apparition but in another moment she was in my embrace
i wept to see her and she wept to see me i because she looked so fresh and pleasant she because i looked so worn and white
but dear biddy how smart you are
yes dear pip
and joe how smart you are
yes dear old pip old chap
i looked at both of them from one to the other and then it s my wedding day
cried biddy in a burst of happiness and i am married to joe
they had taken me into the kitchen and i had laid my head down on the old deal table
biddy held one of my hands to her lips and joe s restoring touch was on my shoulder
which he warn t strong enough my dear fur to be surprised said joe
and biddy said i ought to have thought of it dear joe but i was too happy
they were both so overjoyed to see me so proud to see me so touched by my coming to them so delighted that i should have come by accident to make their day complete
my first thought was one of great thankfulness that i had never breathed this last baffled hope to joe
how often while he was with me in my illness had it risen to my lips
how irrevocable would have been his knowledge of it if he had remained with me but another hour
dear biddy said i you have the best husband in the whole world and if you could have seen him by my bed you would have but no you couldn t love him better than you do
no i couldn t indeed said biddy
and dear joe you have the best wife in the whole world and she will make you as happy as even you deserve to be you dear good noble joe
joe looked at me with a quivering lip and fairly put his sleeve before his eyes
and joe and biddy both as you have been to church to day and are in charity and love with all mankind receive my humble thanks for all you have done for me and all i have so ill repaid
and when i say that i am going away within the hour for i am soon going abroad and that i shall never rest until i have worked for the money with which you have kept me out of prison and have sent it to you don t think dear joe and biddy that if i could repay it a thousand times over i suppose i could cancel a farthing of the debt i owe you or that i would do so if i could
they were both melted by these words and both entreated me to say no more
but i must say more
dear joe i hope you will have children to love and that some little fellow will sit in this chimney corner of a winter night who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for ever
don t tell him joe that i was thankless don t tell him biddy that i was ungenerous and unjust only tell him that i honored you both because you were both so good and true and that as your child i said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than i did
i ain t a going said joe from behind his sleeve to tell him nothink o that natur pip
nor biddy ain t
nor yet no one ain t
and now though i know you have already done it in your own kind hearts pray tell me both that you forgive me
pray let me hear you say the words that i may carry the sound of them away with me and then i shall be able to believe that you can trust me and think better of me in the time to come
o dear old pip old chap said joe
god knows as i forgive you if i have anythink to forgive
amen
and god knows i do
echoed biddy
now let me go up and look at my old little room and rest there a few minutes by myself
and then when i have eaten and drunk with you go with me as far as the finger post dear joe and biddy before we say good bye
i sold all i had and put aside as much as i could for a composition with my creditors who gave me ample time to pay them in full and i went out and joined herbert
within a month i had quitted england and within two months i was clerk to clarriker and co and within four months i assumed my first undivided responsibility
for the beam across the parlor ceiling at mill pond bank had then ceased to tremble under old bill barley s growls and was at peace and herbert had gone away to marry clara and i was left in sole charge of the eastern branch until he brought her back
many a year went round before i was a partner in the house but i lived happily with herbert and his wife and lived frugally and paid my debts and maintained a constant correspondence with biddy and joe
it was not until i became third in the firm that clarriker betrayed me to herbert but he then declared that the secret of herbert s partnership had been long enough upon his conscience and he must tell it
so he told it and herbert was as much moved as amazed and the dear fellow and i were not the worse friends for the long concealment
i must not leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great house or that we made mints of money
we were not in a grand way of business but we had a good name and worked for our profits and did very well
we owed so much to herbert s ever cheerful industry and readiness that i often wondered how i had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude until i was one day enlightened by the reflection that perhaps the inaptitude had never been in him at all but had been in me
chapter lix for eleven years i had not seen joe nor biddy with my bodily eyes though they had both been often before my fancy in the east when upon an evening in december an hour or two after dark i laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door
i touched it so softly that i was not heard and looked in unseen
there smoking his pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight as hale and as strong as ever though a little gray sat joe and there fenced into the corner with joe s leg and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire was i again
we giv him the name of pip for your sake dear old chap said joe delighted when i took another stool by the child s side but i did not rumple his hair and we hoped he might grow a little bit like you and we think he do
i thought so too and i took him out for a walk next morning and we talked immensely understanding one another to perfection
and i took him down to the churchyard and set him on a certain tombstone there and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the memory of philip pirrip late of this parish and also georgiana wife of the above
biddy said i when i talked with her after dinner as her little girl lay sleeping in her lap you must give pip to me one of these days or lend him at all events
no no said biddy gently
you must marry
so herbert and clara say but i don t think i shall biddy
i have so settled down in their home that it s not at all likely
i am already quite an old bachelor
biddy looked down at her child and put its little hand to her lips and then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine
there was something in the action and in the light pressure of biddy s wedding ring that had a very pretty eloquence in it
dear pip said biddy you are sure you don t fret for her
o no i think not biddy
tell me as an old old friend
have you quite forgotten her
my dear biddy i have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a foremost place there and little that ever had any place there
but that poor dream as i once used to call it has all gone by biddy all gone by
nevertheless i knew while i said those words that i secretly intended to revisit the site of the old house that evening alone for her sake
yes even so
for estella s sake
i had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life and as being separated from her husband who had used her with great cruelty and who had become quite renowned as a compound of pride avarice brutality and meanness
and i had heard of the death of her husband from an accident consequent on his ill treatment of a horse
this release had befallen her some two years before for anything i knew she was married again
the early dinner hour at joe s left me abundance of time without hurrying my talk with biddy to walk over to the old spot before dark
but what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think of old times the day had quite declined when i came to the place
there was no house now no brewery no building whatever left but the wall of the old garden
the cleared space had been enclosed with a rough fence and looking over it i saw that some of the old ivy had struck root anew and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin
a gate in the fence standing ajar i pushed it open and went in
a cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon and the moon was not yet up to scatter it
but the stars were shining beyond the mist and the moon was coming and the evening was not dark
i could trace out where every part of the old house had been and where the brewery had been and where the gates and where the casks
i had done so and was looking along the desolate garden walk when i beheld a solitary figure in it
the figure showed itself aware of me as i advanced
it had been moving towards me but it stood still
as i drew nearer i saw it to be the figure of a woman
as i drew nearer yet it was about to turn away when it stopped and let me come up with it
then it faltered as if much surprised and uttered my name and i cried out estella
i am greatly changed
i wonder you know me
the freshness of her beauty was indeed gone but its indescribable majesty and its indescribable charm remained
those attractions in it i had seen before what i had never seen before was the saddened softened light of the once proud eyes what i had never felt before was the friendly touch of the once insensible hand
we sat down on a bench that was near and i said after so many years it is strange that we should thus meet again estella here where our first meeting was
do you often come back
i have never been here since
nor i
the moon began to rise and i thought of the placid look at the white ceiling which had passed away
the moon began to rise and i thought of the pressure on my hand when i had spoken the last words he had heard on earth
estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us
i have very often hoped and intended to come back but have been prevented by many circumstances
poor poor old place
the silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight and the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes
not knowing that i saw them and setting herself to get the better of them she said quietly were you wondering as you walked along how it came to be left in this condition
yes estella
the ground belongs to me
it is the only possession i have not relinquished
everything else has gone from me little by little but i have kept this
it was the subject of the only determined resistance i made in all the wretched years
is it to be built on
at last it is
i came here to take leave of it before its change
and you she said in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer you live abroad still
still
and do well i am sure
i work pretty hard for a sufficient living and therefore yes i do well
i have often thought of you said estella
have you
of late very often
there was a long hard time when i kept far from me the remembrance of what i had thrown away when i was quite ignorant of its worth
but since my duty has not been incompatible with the admission of that remembrance i have given it a place in my heart
you have always held your place in my heart i answered
and we were silent again until she spoke
i little thought said estella that i should take leave of you in taking leave of this spot
i am very glad to do so
glad to part again estella
to me parting is a painful thing
to me the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful
but you said to me returned estella very earnestly god bless you god forgive you
and if you could say that to me then you will not hesitate to say that to me now now when suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be
i have been bent and broken but i hope into a better shape
be as considerate and good to me as you were and tell me we are friends
we are friends said i rising and bending over her as she rose from the bench
and will continue friends apart said estella
i took her hand in mine and we went out of the ruined place and as the morning mists had risen long ago when i first left the forge so the evening mists were rising now and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me i saw no shadow of another parting from her
