before our supper harris and george and i were quarrelsome and snappy and ill tempered after our supper we sat and beamed on one another and we beamed upon the dog too 
we loved each other we loved everybody 
harris in moving about trod on george s corn 
had this happened before supper george would have expressed wishes and desires concerning harris s fate in this world and the next that would have made a thoughtful man shudder 
as it was he said steady old man ware wheat  
and harris instead of merely observing in his most unpleasant tones that a fellow could hardly help treading on some bit of george s foot if he had to move about at all within ten yards of where george was sitting suggesting that george never ought to come into an ordinary sized boat with feet that length and advising him to hang them over the side as he would have done before supper now said oh i m so sorry old chap i hope i haven t hurt you  
 picture smoking pipes and george said not at all  that it was his fault and harris said no it was his 
it was quite pretty to hear them 
we lit our pipes and sat looking out on the quiet night and talked 
george said why could not we be always like this  away from the world with its sin and temptation leading sober peaceful lives and doing good 
i said it was the sort of thing i had often longed for myself and we discussed the possibility of our going away we four to some handy well fitted desert island and living there in the woods 
harris said that the danger about desert islands as far as he had heard was that they were so damp but george said no not if properly drained 
and then we got on to drains and that put george in mind of a very funny thing that happened to his father once 
he said his father was travelling with another fellow through wales and one night they stopped at a little inn where there were some other fellows and they joined the other fellows and spent the evening with them 
they had a very jolly evening and sat up late and by the time they came to go to bed they this was when george s father was a very young man were slightly jolly too 
they george s father and george s father s friend were to sleep in the same room but in different beds 
they took the candle and went up 
the candle lurched up against the wall when they got into the room and went out and they had to undress and grope into bed in the dark 
this they did but instead of getting into separate beds as they thought they were doing they both climbed into the same one without knowing it  one getting in with his head at the top and the other crawling in from the opposite side of the compass and lying with his feet on the pillow 
there was silence for a moment and then george s father said  joe  
 what s the matter tom  
replied joe s voice from the other end of the bed 
 why there s a man in my bed  said george s father here s his feet on my pillow  
 well it s an extraordinary thing tom  answered the other but i m blest if there isn t a man in my bed too  
 what are you going to do  
asked george s father 
 well i m going to chuck him out  replied joe 
 so am i  said george s father valiantly 
there was a brief struggle followed by two heavy bumps on the floor and then a rather doleful voice said  i say tom  
 yes  
 how have you got on  
 well to tell you the truth my man s chucked  me  out  
 so s mine 
i say i don t think much of this inn do you  
 what was the name of that inn  
said harris 
 the pig and whistle  said george 
 why  
 ah no then it isn t the same  replied harris 
 what do you mean  
queried george 
 why it s so curious  murmured harris but precisely that very same thing happened to  my  father once at a country inn 
i ve often heard him tell the tale 
i thought it might have been the same inn  
we turned in at ten that night and i thought i should sleep well being tired but i didn t 
as a rule i undress and put my head on the pillow and then somebody bangs at the door and says it is half past eight but to night everything seemed against me the novelty of it all the hardness of the boat the cramped position i was lying with my feet under one seat and my head on another  the sound of the lapping water round the boat and the wind among the branches kept me restless and disturbed 
i did get to sleep for a few hours and then some part of the boat which seemed to have grown up in the night  for it certainly was not there when we started and it had disappeared by the morning  kept digging into my spine 
i slept through it for a while dreaming that i had swallowed a sovereign and that they were cutting a hole in my back with a gimlet so as to try and get it out 
i thought it very unkind of them and i told them i would owe them the money and they should have it at the end of the month 
but they would not hear of that and said it would be much better if they had it then because otherwise the interest would accumulate so 
i got quite cross with them after a bit and told them what i thought of them and then they gave the gimlet such an excruciating wrench that i woke up 
the boat seemed stuffy and my head ached so i thought i would step out into the cool night air 
i slipped on what clothes i could find about  some of my own and some of george s and harris s  and crept under the canvas on to the bank 
it was a glorious night 
the moon had sunk and left the quiet earth alone with the stars 
it seemed as if in the silence and the hush while we her children slept they were talking with her their sister  conversing of mighty mysteries in voices too vast and deep for childish human ears to catch the sound 
they awe us these strange stars so cold so clear 
we are as children whose small feet have strayed into some dim lit temple of the god they have been taught to worship but know not and standing where the echoing dome spans the long vista of the shadowy light glance up half hoping half afraid to see some awful vision hovering there 
and yet it seems so full of comfort and of strength the night 
in its great presence our small sorrows creep away ashamed 
the day has been so full of fret and care and our hearts have been so full of evil and of bitter thoughts and the world has seemed so hard and wrong to us 
then night like some great loving mother gently lays her hand upon our fevered head and turns our little tear stained faces up to hers and smiles and though she does not speak we know what she would say and lay our hot flushed cheek against her bosom and the pain is gone 
sometimes our pain is very deep and real and we stand before her very silent because there is no language for our pain only a moan 
night s heart is full of pity for us she cannot ease our aching she takes our hand in hers and the little world grows very small and very far away beneath us and borne on her dark wings we pass for a moment into a mightier presence than her own and in the wondrous light of that great presence all human life lies like a book before us and we know that pain and sorrow are but the angels of god 
only those who have worn the crown of suffering can look upon that wondrous light and they when they return may not speak of it or tell the mystery they know 
once upon a time through a strange country there rode some goodly knights and their path lay by a deep wood where tangled briars grew very thick and strong and tore the flesh of them that lost their way therein 
and the leaves of the trees that grew in the wood were very dark and thick so that no ray of light came through the branches to lighten the gloom and sadness 
and as they passed by that dark wood one knight of those that rode missing his comrades wandered far away and returned to them no more and they sorely grieving rode on without him mourning him as one dead 
now when they reached the fair castle towards which they had been journeying they stayed there many days and made merry and one night as they sat in cheerful ease around the logs that burned in the great hall and drank a loving measure there came the comrade they had lost and greeted them 
his clothes were ragged like a beggar s and many sad wounds were on his sweet flesh but upon his face there shone a great radiance of deep joy 
and they questioned him asking him what had befallen him and he told them how in the dark wood he had lost his way and had wandered many days and nights till torn and bleeding he had lain him down to die 
then when he was nigh unto death lo 
through the savage gloom there came to him a stately maiden and took him by the hand and led him on through devious paths unknown to any man until upon the darkness of the wood there dawned a light such as the light of day was unto but as a little lamp unto the sun and in that wondrous light our way worn knight saw as in a dream a vision and so glorious so fair the vision seemed that of his bleeding wounds he thought no more but stood as one entranced whose joy is deep as is the sea whereof no man can tell the depth 
and the vision faded and the knight kneeling upon the ground thanked the good saint who into that sad wood had strayed his steps so he had seen the vision that lay there hid 
and the name of the dark forest was sorrow but of the vision that the good knight saw therein we may not speak nor tell 
chapter xi 
how george once upon a time got up early in the morning   george harris and montmorency do not like the look of the cold water   heroism and determination on the part of j   george and his shirt story with a moral   harris as cook   historical retrospect specially inserted for the use of schools 
i woke at six the next morning and found george awake too 
we both turned round and tried to go to sleep again but we could not 
had there been any particular reason why we should not have gone to sleep again but have got up and dressed then and there we should have dropped off while we were looking at our watches and have slept till ten 
as there was no earthly necessity for our getting up under another two hours at the very least and our getting up at that time was an utter absurdity it was only in keeping with the natural cussedness of things in general that we should both feel that lying down for five minutes more would be death to us 
george said that the same kind of thing only worse had happened to him some eighteen months ago when he was lodging by himself in the house of a certain mrs gippings 
he said his watch went wrong one evening and stopped at a quarter past eight 
he did not know this at the time because for some reason or other he forgot to wind it up when he went to bed an unusual occurrence with him  and hung it up over his pillow without ever looking at the thing 
it was in the winter when this happened very near the shortest day and a week of fog into the bargain so the fact that it was still very dark when george woke in the morning was no guide to him as to the time 
he reached up and hauled down his watch 
it was a quarter past eight 
 angels and ministers of grace defend us  
exclaimed george and here have i got to be in the city by nine 
why didn t somebody call me 
oh this is a shame  
and he flung the watch down and sprang out of bed and had a cold bath and washed himself and dressed himself and shaved himself in cold water because there was not time to wait for the hot and then rushed and had another look at the watch 
whether the shaking it had received in being thrown down on the bed had started it or how it was george could not say but certain it was that from a quarter past eight it had begun to go and now pointed to twenty minutes to nine 
george snatched it up and rushed downstairs 
in the sitting room all was dark and silent there was no fire no breakfast 
george said it was a wicked shame of mrs g  and he made up his mind to tell her what he thought of her when he came home in the evening 
then he dashed on his great coat and hat and seizing his umbrella made for the front door 
the door was not even unbolted 
george anathematized mrs g for a lazy old woman and thought it was very strange that people could not get up at a decent respectable time unlocked and unbolted the door and ran out 
he ran hard for a quarter of a mile and at the end of that distance it began to be borne in upon him as a strange and curious thing that there were so few people about and that there were no shops open 
it was certainly a very dark and foggy morning but still it seemed an unusual course to stop all business on that account 
he  had to go to business why should other people stop in bed merely because it was dark and foggy 
at length he reached holborn 
not a shutter was down 
not a bus was about 
there were three men in sight one of whom was a policeman a market cart full of cabbages and a dilapidated looking cab 
george pulled out his watch and looked at it it was five minutes to nine 
he stood still and counted his pulse 
he stooped down and felt his legs 
then with his watch still in his hand he went up to the policeman and asked him if he knew what the time was 
 picture george and the policeman what s the time  
said the man eyeing george up and down with evident suspicion why if you listen you will hear it strike  
george listened and a neighbouring clock immediately obliged 
 but it s only gone three  
said george in an injured tone when it had finished 
 well and how many did you want it to go  
replied the constable 
 why nine  said george showing his watch 
 do you know where you live  
said the guardian of public order severely 
george thought and gave the address 
 oh 
that s where it is is it  
replied the man well you take my advice and go there quietly and take that watch of yours with you and don t let s have any more of it  
and george went home again musing as he walked along and let himself in 
at first when he got in he determined to undress and go to bed again but when he thought of the redressing and re washing and the having of another bath he determined he would not but would sit up and go to sleep in the easy chair 
but he could not get to sleep he never felt more wakeful in his life so he lit the lamp and got out the chess board and played himself a game of chess 
but even that did not enliven him it seemed slow somehow so he gave chess up and tried to read 
he did not seem able to take any sort of interest in reading either so he put on his coat again and went out for a walk 
it was horribly lonesome and dismal and all the policemen he met regarded him with undisguised suspicion and turned their lanterns on him and followed him about and this had such an effect upon him at last that he began to feel as if he really had done something and he got to slinking down the by streets and hiding in dark doorways when he heard the regulation flip flop approaching 
of course this conduct made the force only more distrustful of him than ever and they would come and rout him out and ask him what he was doing there and when he answered nothing  he had merely come out for a stroll it was then four o clock in the morning  they looked as though they did not believe him and two plain clothes constables came home with him to see if he really did live where he had said he did 
they saw him go in with his key and then they took up a position opposite and watched the house 
he thought he would light the fire when he got inside and make himself some breakfast just to pass away the time but he did not seem able to handle anything from a scuttleful of coals to a teaspoon without dropping it or falling over it and making such a noise that he was in mortal fear that it would wake mrs g up and that she would think it was burglars and open the window and call police  
and then these two detectives would rush in and handcuff him and march him off to the police court 
he was in a morbidly nervous state by this time and he pictured the trial and his trying to explain the circumstances to the jury and nobody believing him and his being sentenced to twenty years penal servitude and his mother dying of a broken heart 
so he gave up trying to get breakfast and wrapped himself up in his overcoat and sat in the easy chair till mrs g came down at half past seven 
he said he had never got up too early since that morning it had been such a warning to him 
we had been sitting huddled up in our rugs while george had been telling me this true story and on his finishing it i set to work to wake up harris with a scull 
the third prod did it and he turned over on the other side and said he would be down in a minute and that he would have his lace up boots 
we soon let him know where he was however by the aid of the hitcher and he sat up suddenly sending montmorency who had been sleeping the sleep of the just right on the middle of his chest sprawling across the boat 
then we pulled up the canvas and all four of us poked our heads out over the off side and looked down at the water and shivered 
the idea overnight had been that we should get up early in the morning fling off our rugs and shawls and throwing back the canvas spring into the river with a joyous shout and revel in a long delicious swim 
somehow now the morning had come the notion seemed less tempting 
the water looked damp and chilly the wind felt cold 
 well who s going to be first in  
said harris at last 
there was no rush for precedence 
george settled the matter so far as he was concerned by retiring into the boat and pulling on his socks 
montmorency gave vent to an involuntary howl as if merely thinking of the thing had given him the horrors and harris said it would be so difficult to get into the boat again and went back and sorted out his trousers 
i did not altogether like to give in though i did not relish the plunge 
there might be snags about or weeds i thought 
i meant to compromise matters by going down to the edge and just throwing the water over myself so i took a towel and crept out on the bank and wormed my way along on to the branch of a tree that dipped down into the water 
 picture in the thames it was bitterly cold 
the wind cut like a knife 
i thought i would not throw the water over myself after all 
i would go back into the boat and dress and i turned to do so and as i turned the silly branch gave way and i and the towel went in together with a tremendous splash and i was out mid stream with a gallon of thames water inside me before i knew what had happened 
 by jove 
old j 
 s gone in  i heard harris say as i came blowing to the surface 
 i didn t think he d have the pluck to do it 
did you  
 is it all right  
sung out george 
 lovely  i spluttered back 
 you are duffers not to come in 
i wouldn t have missed this for worlds 
why won t you try it 
it only wants a little determination  
but i could not persuade them 
rather an amusing thing happened while dressing that morning 
i was very cold when i got back into the boat and in my hurry to get my shirt on i accidentally jerked it into the water 
it made me awfully wild especially as george burst out laughing 
i could not see anything to laugh at and i told george so and he only laughed the more 
i never saw a man laugh so much 
i quite lost my temper with him at last and i pointed out to him what a drivelling maniac of an imbecile idiot he was but he only roared the louder 
and then just as i was landing the shirt i noticed that it was not my shirt at all but george s which i had mistaken for mine whereupon the humour of the thing struck me for the first time and i began to laugh 
and the more i looked from george s wet shirt to george roaring with laughter the more i was amused and i laughed so much that i had to let the shirt fall back into the water again 
 ar n t you  you  going to get it out  
said george between his shrieks 
i could not answer him at all for a while i was laughing so but at last between my peals i managed to jerk out  it isn t my shirt  it s  yours  
i never saw a man s face change from lively to severe so suddenly in all my life before 
 what  
he yelled springing up 
 you silly cuckoo 
why can t you be more careful what you re doing 
why the deuce don t you go and dress on the bank 
you re not fit to be in a boat you re not 
gimme the hitcher  
i tried to make him see the fun of the thing but he could not 
george is very dense at seeing a joke sometimes 
harris proposed that we should have scrambled eggs for breakfast 
he said he would cook them 
it seemed from his account that he was very good at doing scrambled eggs 
he often did them at picnics and when out on yachts 
he was quite famous for them 
people who had once tasted his scrambled eggs so we gathered from his conversation never cared for any other food afterwards but pined away and died when they could not get them 
it made our mouths water to hear him talk about the things and we handed him out the stove and the frying pan and all the eggs that had not smashed and gone over everything in the hamper and begged him to begin 
he had some trouble in breaking the eggs  or rather not so much trouble in breaking them exactly as in getting them into the frying pan when broken and keeping them off his trousers and preventing them from running up his sleeve but he fixed some half a dozen into the pan at last and then squatted down by the side of the stove and chivied them about with a fork 
it seemed harassing work so far as george and i could judge 
whenever he went near the pan he burned himself and then he would drop everything and dance round the stove flicking his fingers about and cursing the things 
indeed every time george and i looked round at him he was sure to be performing this feat 
we thought at first that it was a necessary part of the culinary arrangements 
we did not know what scrambled eggs were and we fancied that it must be some red indian or sandwich islands sort of dish that required dances and incantations for its proper cooking 
montmorency went and put his nose over it once and the fat spluttered up and scalded him and then  he  began dancing and cursing 
altogether it was one of the most interesting and exciting operations i have ever witnessed 
george and i were both quite sorry when it was over 
the result was not altogether the success that harris had anticipated 
there seemed so little to show for the business 
six eggs had gone into the frying pan and all that came out was a teaspoonful of burnt and unappetizing looking mess 
harris said it was the fault of the frying pan and thought it would have gone better if we had had a fish kettle and a gas stove and we decided not to attempt the dish again until we had those aids to housekeeping by us 
the sun had got more powerful by the time we had finished breakfast and the wind had dropped and it was as lovely a morning as one could desire 
little was in sight to remind us of the nineteenth century and as we looked out upon the river in the morning sunlight we could almost fancy that the centuries between us and that ever to be famous june morning of    had been drawn aside and that we english yeomen s sons in homespun cloth with dirk at belt were waiting there to witness the writing of that stupendous page of history the meaning whereof was to be translated to the common people some four hundred and odd years later by one oliver cromwell who had deeply studied it 
it is a fine summer morning  sunny soft and still 
but through the air there runs a thrill of coming stir 
king john has slept at duncroft hall and all the day before the little town of staines has echoed to the clang of armed men and the clatter of great horses over its rough stones and the shouts of captains and the grim oaths and surly jests of bearded bowmen billmen pikemen and strange speaking foreign spearmen 
gay cloaked companies of knights and squires have ridden in all travel stained and dusty 
and all the evening long the timid townsmen s doors have had to be quick opened to let in rough groups of soldiers for whom there must be found both board and lodging and the best of both or woe betide the house and all within for the sword is judge and jury plaintiff and executioner in these tempestuous times and pays for what it takes by sparing those from whom it takes it if it pleases it to do so 
round the camp fire in the market place gather still more of the barons troops and eat and drink deep and bellow forth roystering drinking songs and gamble and quarrel as the evening grows and deepens into night 
the firelight sheds quaint shadows on their piled up arms and on their uncouth forms 
the children of the town steal round to watch them wondering and brawny country wenches laughing draw near to bandy ale house jest and jibe with the swaggering troopers so unlike the village swains who now despised stand apart behind with vacant grins upon their broad peering faces 
and out from the fields around glitter the faint lights of more distant camps as here some great lord s followers lie mustered and there false john s french mercenaries hover like crouching wolves without the town 
and so with sentinel in each dark street and twinkling watch fires on each height around the night has worn away and over this fair valley of old thame has broken the morning of the great day that is to close so big with the fate of ages yet unborn 
ever since grey dawn in the lower of the two islands just above where we are standing there has been great clamour and the sound of many workmen 
the great pavilion brought there yester eve is being raised and carpenters are busy nailing tiers of seats while prentices from london town are there with many coloured stuffs and silks and cloth of gold and silver 
and now lo 
down upon the road that winds along the river s bank from staines there come towards us laughing and talking together in deep guttural bass a half a score of stalwart halbert men  barons men these  and halt at a hundred yards or so above us on the other bank and lean upon their arms and wait 
and so from hour to hour march up along the road ever fresh groups and bands of armed men their casques and breastplates flashing back the long low lines of morning sunlight until as far as eye can reach the way seems thick with glittering steel and prancing steeds 
and shouting horsemen are galloping from group to group and little banners are fluttering lazily in the warm breeze and every now and then there is a deeper stir as the ranks make way on either side and some great baron on his war horse with his guard of squires around him passes along to take his station at the head of his serfs and vassals 
and up the slope of cooper s hill just opposite are gathered the wondering rustics and curious townsfolk who have run from staines and none are quite sure what the bustle is about but each one has a different version of the great event that they have come to see and some say that much good to all the people will come from this day s work but the old men shake their heads for they have heard such tales before 
and all the river down to staines is dotted with small craft and boats and tiny coracles  which last are growing out of favour now and are used only by the poorer folk 
over the rapids where in after years trim bell weir lock will stand they have been forced or dragged by their sturdy rowers and now are crowding up as near as they dare come to the great covered barges which lie in readiness to bear king john to where the fateful charter waits his signing 
it is noon and we and all the people have been waiting patient for many an hour and the rumour has run round that slippery john has again escaped from the barons grasp and has stolen away from duncroft hall with his mercenaries at his heels and will soon be doing other work than signing charters for his people s liberty 
not so 
this time the grip upon him has been one of iron and he has slid and wriggled in vain 
far down the road a little cloud of dust has risen and draws nearer and grows larger and the pattering of many hoofs grows louder and in and out between the scattered groups of drawn up men there pushes on its way a brilliant cavalcade of gay dressed lords and knights 
and front and rear and either flank there ride the yeomen of the barons and in the midst king john 
he rides to where the barges lie in readiness and the great barons step forth from their ranks to meet him 
he greets them with a smile and laugh and pleasant honeyed words as though it were some feast in his honour to which he had been invited 
but as he rises to dismount he casts one hurried glance from his own french mercenaries drawn up in the rear to the grim ranks of the barons men that hem him in 
is it too late 
one fierce blow at the unsuspecting horseman at his side one cry to his french troops one desperate charge upon the unready lines before him and these rebellious barons might rue the day they dared to thwart his plans 
a bolder hand might have turned the game even at that point 
had it been a richard there 
the cup of liberty might have been dashed from england s lips and the taste of freedom held back for a hundred years 
but the heart of king john sinks before the stern faces of the english fighting men and the arm of king john drops back on to his rein and he dismounts and takes his seat in the foremost barge 
and the barons follow in with each mailed hand upon the sword hilt and the word is given to let go 
slowly the heavy bright decked barges leave the shore of runningmede 
slowly against the swift current they work their ponderous way till with a low grumble they grate against the bank of the little island that from this day will bear the name of magna charta island 
and king john has stepped upon the shore and we wait in breathless silence till a great shout cleaves the air and the great cornerstone in england s temple of liberty has now we know been firmly laid 
chapter xii 
henry viii 
and anne boleyn   disadvantages of living in same house with pair of lovers   a trying time for the english nation   a night search for the picturesque   homeless and houseless   harris prepares to die   an angel comes along   effect of sudden joy on harris   a little supper   lunch   high price for mustard   a fearful battle   maidenhead   sailing   three fishers   we are cursed 
i was sitting on the bank conjuring up this scene to myself when george remarked that when i was quite rested perhaps i would not mind helping to wash up and thus recalled from the days of the glorious past to the prosaic present with all its misery and sin i slid down into the boat and cleaned out the frying pan with a stick of wood and a tuft of grass polishing it up finally with george s wet shirt 
we went over to magna charta island and had a look at the stone which stands in the cottage there and on which the great charter is said to have been signed though as to whether it really was signed there or as some say on the other bank at runningmede  i decline to commit myself 
as far as my own personal opinion goes however i am inclined to give weight to the popular island theory 
certainly had i been one of the barons at the time i should have strongly urged upon my comrades the advisability of our getting such a slippery customer as king john on to the island where there was less chance of surprises and tricks 
there are the ruins of an old priory in the grounds of ankerwyke house which is close to picnic point and it was round about the grounds of this old priory that henry viii 
is said to have waited for and met anne boleyn 
he also used to meet her at hever castle in kent and also somewhere near st albans 
it must have been difficult for the people of england in those days to have found a spot where these thoughtless young folk were  not  spooning 
have you ever been in a house where there are a couple courting 
it is most trying 
you think you will go and sit in the drawing room and you march off there 
as you open the door you hear a noise as if somebody had suddenly recollected something and when you get in emily is over by the window full of interest in the opposite side of the road and your friend john edward is at the other end of the room with his whole soul held in thrall by photographs of other people s relatives 
 oh  
you say pausing at the door i didn t know anybody was here  
 oh 
didn t you  
says emily coldly in a tone which implies that she does not believe you 
you hang about for a bit then you say  it s very dark 
why don t you light the gas  
john edward says oh  
he hadn t noticed it and emily says that papa does not like the gas lit in the afternoon 
you tell them one or two items of news and give them your views and opinions on the irish question but this does not appear to interest them 
all they remark on any subject is oh  
 is it  
 did he  
 yes  and you don t say so  
and after ten minutes of such style of conversation you edge up to the door and slip out and are surprised to find that the door immediately closes behind you and shuts itself without your having touched it 
half an hour later you think you will try a pipe in the conservatory 
the only chair in the place is occupied by emily and john edward if the language of clothes can be relied upon has evidently been sitting on the floor 
they do not speak but they give you a look that says all that can be said in a civilised community and you back out promptly and shut the door behind you 
you are afraid to poke your nose into any room in the house now so after walking up and down the stairs for a while you go and sit in your own bedroom 
this becomes uninteresting however after a time and so you put on your hat and stroll out into the garden 
you walk down the path and as you pass the summer house you glance in and there are those two young idiots huddled up into one corner of it and they see you and are evidently under the idea that for some wicked purpose of your own you are following them about 
 why don t they have a special room for this sort of thing and make people keep to it  
you mutter and you rush back to the hall and get your umbrella and go out 
it must have been much like this when that foolish boy henry viii 
was courting his little anne 
people in buckinghamshire would have come upon them unexpectedly when they were mooning round windsor and wraysbury and have exclaimed oh 
you here  
and henry would have blushed and said yes he d just come over to see a man  and anne would have said oh i m so glad to see you 
isn t it funny 
i ve just met mr henry viii 
in the lane and he s going the same way i am  
then those people would have gone away and said to themselves oh 
we d better get out of here while this billing and cooing is on 
we ll go down to kent  
and they would go to kent and the first thing they would see in kent when they got there would be henry and anne fooling round hever castle 
 oh drat this  
they would have said 
 here let s go away 
i can t stand any more of it 
let s go to st albans  nice quiet place st 
albans  
 picture river scene  and when they reached st albans there would be that wretched couple kissing under the abbey walls 
then these folks would go and be pirates until the marriage was over 
from picnic point to old windsor lock is a delightful bit of the river 
a shady road dotted here and there with dainty little cottages runs by the bank up to the bells of ouseley  a picturesque inn as most up river inns are and a place where a very good glass of ale may be drunk  so harris says and on a matter of this kind you can take harris s word 
old windsor is a famous spot in its way 
edward the confessor had a palace here and here the great earl godwin was proved guilty by the justice of that age of having encompassed the death of the king s brother 
earl godwin broke a piece of bread and held it in his hand 
 if i am guilty  said the earl may this bread choke me when i eat it  
then he put the bread into his mouth and swallowed it and it choked him and he died 
after you pass old windsor the river is somewhat uninteresting and does not become itself again until you are nearing boveney 
george and i towed up past the home park which stretches along the right bank from albert to victoria bridge and as we were passing datchet george asked me if i remembered our first trip up the river and when we landed at datchet at ten o clock at night and wanted to go to bed 
i answered that i did remember it 
it will be some time before i forget it 
it was the saturday before the august bank holiday 
we were tired and hungry we same three and when we got to datchet we took out the hamper the two bags and the rugs and coats and such like things and started off to look for diggings 
we passed a very pretty little hotel with clematis and creeper over the porch but there was no honeysuckle about it and for some reason or other i had got my mind fixed on honeysuckle and i said  oh don t let s go in there 
let s go on a bit further and see if there isn t one with honeysuckle over it  
so we went on till we came to another hotel 
that was a very nice hotel too and it had honey suckle on it round at the side but harris did not like the look of a man who was leaning against the front door 
he said he didn t look a nice man at all and he wore ugly boots so we went on further 
we went a goodish way without coming across any more hotels and then we met a man and asked him to direct us to a few 
he said  why you are coming away from them 
you must turn right round and go back and then you will come to the stag  
we said  oh we had been there and didn t like it  no honeysuckle over it  
 well then  he said there s the manor house just opposite 
have you tried that  
harris replied that we did not want to go there  didn t like the looks of a man who was stopping there  harris did not like the colour of his hair didn t like his boots either 
 well i don t know what you ll do i m sure  said our informant because they are the only two inns in the place  
 no other inns  
exclaimed harris 
 none  replied the man 
 what on earth are we to do  
cried harris 
then george spoke up 
he said harris and i could get an hotel built for us if we liked and have some people made to put in 
for his part he was going back to the stag 
the greatest minds never realise their ideals in any matter and harris and i sighed over the hollowness of all earthly desires and followed george 
we took our traps into the stag and laid them down in the hall 
the landlord came up and said  good evening gentlemen  
 oh good evening  said george we want three beds please  
 very sorry sir  said the landlord but i m afraid we can t manage it  
 oh well never mind  said george two will do 
two of us can sleep in one bed can t we  
he continued turning to harris and me 
harris said oh yes  he thought george and i could sleep in one bed very easily 
 very sorry sir  again repeated the landlord but we really haven t got a bed vacant in the whole house 
in fact we are putting two and even three gentlemen in one bed as it is  
this staggered us for a bit 
but harris who is an old traveller rose to the occasion and laughing cheerily said  oh well we can t help it 
we must rough it 
you must give us a shake down in the billiard room  
 very sorry sir 
three gentlemen sleeping on the billiard table already and two in the coffee room 
can t possibly take you in to night  
we picked up our things and went over to the manor house 
it was a pretty little place 
i said i thought i should like it better than the other house and harris said oh yes  it would be all right and we needn t look at the man with the red hair besides the poor fellow couldn t help having red hair 
harris spoke quite kindly and sensibly about it 
the people at the manor house did not wait to hear us talk 
the landlady met us on the doorstep with the greeting that we were the fourteenth party she had turned away within the last hour and a half 
as for our meek suggestions of stables billiard room or coal cellars she laughed them all to scorn all these nooks had been snatched up long ago 
did she know of any place in the whole village where we could get shelter for the night 
 well if we didn t mind roughing it  she did not recommend it mind  but there was a little beershop half a mile down the eton road    we waited to hear no more we caught up the hamper and the bags and the coats and rugs and parcels and ran 
the distance seemed more like a mile than half a mile but we reached the place at last and rushed panting into the bar 
the people at the beershop were rude 
they merely laughed at us 
there were only three beds in the whole house and they had seven single gentlemen and two married couples sleeping there already 
a kind hearted bargeman however who happened to be in the tap room thought we might try the grocer s next door to the stag and we went back 
the grocer s was full 
an old woman we met in the shop then kindly took us along with her for a quarter of a mile to a lady friend of hers who occasionally let rooms to gentlemen 
this old woman walked very slowly and we were twenty minutes getting to her lady friend s 
she enlivened the journey by describing to us as we trailed along the various pains she had in her back 
her lady friend s rooms were let 
from there we were recommended to no 
   
no 
  was full and sent us to no 
   and  was full 
then we went back into the high road and harris sat down on the hamper and said he would go no further 
he said it seemed a quiet spot and he would like to die there 
he requested george and me to kiss his mother for him and to tell all his relations that he forgave them and died happy 
at that moment an angel came by in the disguise of a small boy and i cannot think of any more effective disguise an angel could have assumed  with a can of beer in one hand and in the other something at the end of a string which he let down on to every flat stone he came across and then pulled up again this producing a peculiarly unattractive sound suggestive of suffering 
we asked this heavenly messenger as we discovered him afterwards to be if he knew of any lonely house whose occupants were few and feeble old ladies or paralysed gentlemen preferred  who could be easily frightened into giving up their beds for the night to three desperate men or if not this could he recommend us to an empty pigstye or a disused limekiln or anything of that sort 
he did not know of any such place  at least not one handy but he said that if we liked to come with him his mother had a room to spare and could put us up for the night 
we fell upon his neck there in the moonlight and blessed him and it would have made a very beautiful picture if the boy himself had not been so over powered by our emotion as to be unable to sustain himself under it and sunk to the ground letting us all down on top of him 
harris was so overcome with joy that he fainted and had to seize the boy s beer can and half empty it before he could recover consciousness and then he started off at a run and left george and me to bring on the luggage 
it was a little four roomed cottage where the boy lived and his mother  good soul   gave us hot bacon for supper and we ate it all  five pounds  and a jam tart afterwards and two pots of tea and then we went to bed 
there were two beds in the room one was a ft 
 in 
truckle bed and george and i slept in that and kept in by tying ourselves together with a sheet and the other was the little boy s bed and harris had that all to himself and we found him in the morning with two feet of bare leg sticking out at the bottom and george and i used it to hang the towels on while we bathed 
we were not so uppish about what sort of hotel we would have next time we went to datchet 
to return to our present trip nothing exciting happened and we tugged steadily on to a little below monkey island where we drew up and lunched 
we tackled the cold beef for lunch and then we found that we had forgotten to bring any mustard 
i don t think i ever in my life before or since felt i wanted mustard as badly as i felt i wanted it then 
i don t care for mustard as a rule and it is very seldom that i take it at all but i would have given worlds for it then 
i don t know how many worlds there may be in the universe but anyone who had brought me a spoonful of mustard at that precise moment could have had them all 
i grow reckless like that when i want a thing and can t get it 
harris said he would have given worlds for mustard too 
it would have been a good thing for anybody who had come up to that spot with a can of mustard then he would have been set up in worlds for the rest of his life 
but there 
i daresay both harris and i would have tried to back out of the bargain after we had got the mustard 
one makes these extravagant offers in moments of excitement but of course when one comes to think of it one sees how absurdly out of proportion they are with the value of the required article 
i heard a man going up a mountain in switzerland once say he would give worlds for a glass of beer and when he came to a little shanty where they kept it he kicked up a most fearful row because they charged him five francs for a bottle of bass 
he said it was a scandalous imposition and he wrote to the  times  about it 
it cast a gloom over the boat there being no mustard 
we ate our beef in silence 
existence seemed hollow and uninteresting 
we thought of the happy days of childhood and sighed 
we brightened up a bit however over the apple tart and when george drew out a tin of pine apple from the bottom of the hamper and rolled it into the middle of the boat we felt that life was worth living after all 
we are very fond of pine apple all three of us 
we looked at the picture on the tin we thought of the juice 
we smiled at one another and harris got a spoon ready 
then we looked for the knife to open the tin with 
we turned out everything in the hamper 
we turned out the bags 
we pulled up the boards at the bottom of the boat 
we took everything out on to the bank and shook it 
there was no tin opener to be found 
then harris tried to open the tin with a pocket knife and broke the knife and cut himself badly and george tried a pair of scissors and the scissors flew up and nearly put his eye out 
while they were dressing their wounds i tried to make a hole in the thing with the spiky end of the hitcher and the hitcher slipped and jerked me out between the boat and the bank into two feet of muddy water and the tin rolled over uninjured and broke a teacup 
then we all got mad 
we took that tin out on the bank and harris went up into a field and got a big sharp stone and i went back into the boat and brought out the mast and george held the tin and harris held the sharp end of his stone against the top of it and i took the mast and poised it high up in the air and gathered up all my strength and brought it down 
it was george s straw hat that saved his life that day 
he keeps that hat now what is left of it  and of a winter s evening when the pipes are lit and the boys are telling stretchers about the dangers they have passed through george brings it down and shows it round and the stirring tale is told anew with fresh exaggerations every time 
harris got off with merely a flesh wound 
after that i took the tin off myself and hammered at it with the mast till i was worn out and sick at heart whereupon harris took it in hand 
 picture flattened tin we beat it out flat we beat it back square we battered it into every form known to geometry  but we could not make a hole in it 
then george went at it and knocked it into a shape so strange so weird so unearthly in its wild hideousness that he got frightened and threw away the mast 
then we all three sat round it on the grass and looked at it 
there was one great dent across the top that had the appearance of a mocking grin and it drove us furious so that harris rushed at the thing and caught it up and flung it far into the middle of the river and as it sank we hurled our curses at it and we got into the boat and rowed away from the spot and never paused till we reached maidenhead 
maidenhead itself is too snobby to be pleasant 
it is the haunt of the river swell and his overdressed female companion 
it is the town of showy hotels patronised chiefly by dudes and ballet girls 
it is the witch s kitchen from which go forth those demons of the river  steam launches 
the  london journal  duke always has his little place at maidenhead and the heroine of the three volume novel always dines there when she goes out on the spree with somebody else s husband 
 picture river scene  we went through maidenhead quickly and then eased up and took leisurely that grand reach beyond boulter s and cookham locks 
clieveden woods still wore their dainty dress of spring and rose up from the water s edge in one long harmony of blended shades of fairy green 
in its unbroken loveliness this is perhaps the sweetest stretch of all the river and lingeringly we slowly drew our little boat away from its deep peace 
we pulled up in the backwater just below cookham and had tea and when we were through the lock it was evening 
a stiffish breeze had sprung up  in our favour for a wonder for as a rule on the river the wind is always dead against you whatever way you go 
it is against you in the morning when you start for a day s trip and you pull a long distance thinking how easy it will be to come back with the sail 
then after tea the wind veers round and you have to pull hard in its teeth all the way home 
when you forget to take the sail at all then the wind is consistently in your favour both ways 
but there 
this world is only a probation and man was born to trouble as the sparks fly upward 
this evening however they had evidently made a mistake and had put the wind round at our back instead of in our face 
we kept very quiet about it and got the sail up quickly before they found it out and then we spread ourselves about the boat in thoughtful attitudes and the sail bellied out and strained and grumbled at the mast and the boat flew 
i steered 
there is no more thrilling sensation i know of than sailing 
it comes as near to flying as man has got to yet  except in dreams 
the wings of the rushing wind seem to be bearing you onward you know not where 
you are no longer the slow plodding puny thing of clay creeping tortuously upon the ground you are a part of nature 
your heart is throbbing against hers 
her glorious arms are round you raising you up against her heart 
your spirit is at one with hers your limbs grow light 
the voices of the air are singing to you 
the earth seems far away and little and the clouds so close above your head are brothers and you stretch your arms to them 
we had the river to ourselves except that far in the distance we could see a fishing punt moored in mid stream on which three fishermen sat and we skimmed over the water and passed the wooded banks and no one spoke 
i was steering 
as we drew nearer we could see that the three men fishing seemed old and solemn looking men 
they sat on three chairs in the punt and watched intently their lines 
and the red sunset threw a mystic light upon the waters and tinged with fire the towering woods and made a golden glory of the piled up clouds 
it was an hour of deep enchantment of ecstatic hope and longing 
the little sail stood out against the purple sky the gloaming lay around us wrapping the world in rainbow shadows and behind us crept the night 
we seemed like knights of some old legend sailing across some mystic lake into the unknown realm of twilight unto the great land of the sunset 
we did not go into the realm of twilight we went slap into that punt where those three old men were fishing 
we did not know what had happened at first because the sail shut out the view but from the nature of the language that rose up upon the evening air we gathered that we had come into the neighbourhood of human beings and that they were vexed and discontented 
harris let the sail down and then we saw what had happened 
we had knocked those three old gentlemen off their chairs into a general heap at the bottom of the boat and they were now slowly and painfully sorting themselves out from each other and picking fish off themselves and as they worked they cursed us  not with a common cursory curse but with long carefully thought out comprehensive curses that embraced the whole of our career and went away into the distant future and included all our relations and covered everything connected with us  good substantial curses 
harris told them they ought to be grateful for a little excitement sitting there fishing all day and he also said that he was shocked and grieved to hear men their age give way to temper so 
but it did not do any good 
george said he would steer after that 
he said a mind like mine ought not to be expected to give itself away in steering boats  better let a mere commonplace human being see after that boat before we jolly well all got drowned and he took the lines and brought us up to marlow 
and at marlow we left the boat by the bridge and went and put up for the night at the crown  
 picture the boat     chapter xiii 
marlow   bisham abbey   the medmenham monks   montmorency thinks he will murder an old tom cat   but eventually decides that he will let it live   shameful conduct of a fox terrier at the civil service stores   our departure from marlow   an imposing procession   the steam launch useful receipts for annoying and hindering it   we decline to drink the river   a peaceful dog   strange disappearance of harris and a pie 
marlow is one of the pleasantest river centres i know of 
it is a bustling lively little town not very picturesque on the whole it is true but there are many quaint nooks and corners to be found in it nevertheless  standing arches in the shattered bridge of time over which our fancy travels back to the days when marlow manor owned saxon algar for its lord ere conquering william seized it to give to queen matilda ere it passed to the earls of warwick or to worldly wise lord paget the councillor of four successive sovereigns 
there is lovely country round about it too if after boating you are fond of a walk while the river itself is at its best here 
down to cookham past the quarry woods and the meadows is a lovely reach 
dear old quarry woods 
with your narrow climbing paths and little winding glades how scented to this hour you seem with memories of sunny summer days 
how haunted are your shadowy vistas with the ghosts of laughing faces 
how from your whispering leaves there softly fall the voices of long ago 
 picture bisham abbey from marlow up to sonning is even fairer yet 
grand old bisham abbey whose stone walls have rung to the shouts of the knights templars and which at one time was the home of anne of cleves and at another of queen elizabeth is passed on the right bank just half a mile above marlow bridge 
bisham abbey is rich in melodramatic properties 
it contains a tapestry bed chamber and a secret room hid high up in the thick walls 
the ghost of the lady holy who beat her little boy to death still walks there at night trying to wash its ghostly hands clean in a ghostly basin 
warwick the king maker rests there careless now about such trivial things as earthly kings and earthly kingdoms and salisbury who did good service at poitiers 
just before you come to the abbey and right on the river s bank is bisham church and perhaps if any tombs are worth inspecting they are the tombs and monuments in bisham church 
it was while floating in his boat under the bisham beeches that shelley who was then living at marlow you can see his house now in west street  composed  the revolt of islam 
by hurley weir a little higher up i have often thought that i could stay a month without having sufficient time to drink in all the beauty of the scene 
the village of hurley five minutes walk from the lock is as old a little spot as there is on the river dating as it does to quote the quaint phraseology of those dim days from the times of king sebert and king offa  
just past the weir going up is danes field where the invading danes once encamped during their march to gloucestershire and a little further still nestling by a sweet corner of the stream is what is left of medmenham abbey 
the famous medmenham monks or hell fire club  as they were commonly called and of whom the notorious wilkes was a member were a fraternity whose motto was do as you please  and that invitation still stands over the ruined doorway of the abbey 
many years before this bogus abbey with its congregation of irreverent jesters was founded there stood upon this same spot a monastery of a sterner kind whose monks were of a somewhat different type to the revellers that were to follow them five hundred years afterwards 
the cistercian monks whose abbey stood there in the thirteenth century wore no clothes but rough tunics and cowls and ate no flesh nor fish nor eggs 
they lay upon straw and they rose at midnight to mass 
they spent the day in labour reading and prayer and over all their lives there fell a silence as of death for no one spoke 
a grim fraternity passing grim lives in that sweet spot that god had made so bright 
strange that nature s voices all around them  the soft singing of the waters the whisperings of the river grass the music of the rushing wind  should not have taught them a truer meaning of life than this 
they listened there through the long days in silence waiting for a voice from heaven and all day long and through the solemn night it spoke to them in myriad tones and they heard it not 
from medmenham to sweet hambledon lock the river is full of peaceful beauty but after it passes greenlands the rather uninteresting looking river residence of my newsagent  a quiet unassuming old gentleman who may often be met with about these regions during the summer months sculling himself along in easy vigorous style or chatting genially to some old lock keeper as he passes through  until well the other side of henley it is somewhat bare and dull 
we got up tolerably early on the monday morning at marlow and went for a bathe before breakfast and coming back montmorency made an awful ass of himself 
the only subject on which montmorency and i have any serious difference of opinion is cats 
i like cats montmorency does not 
 picture cat when i meet a cat i say poor pussy  
and stop down and tickle the side of its head and the cat sticks up its tail in a rigid cast iron manner arches its back and wipes its nose up against my trousers and all is gentleness and peace 
when montmorency meets a cat the whole street knows about it and there is enough bad language wasted in ten seconds to last an ordinarily respectable man all his life with care 
i do not blame the dog contenting myself as a rule with merely clouting his head or throwing stones at him  because i take it that it is his nature 
fox terriers are born with about four times as much original sin in them as other dogs are and it will take years and years of patient effort on the part of us christians to bring about any appreciable reformation in the rowdiness of the fox terrier nature 
i remember being in the lobby of the haymarket stores one day and all round about me were dogs waiting for the return of their owners who were shopping inside 
there were a mastiff and one or two collies and a st bernard a few retrievers and newfoundlands a boar hound a french poodle with plenty of hair round its head but mangy about the middle a bull dog a few lowther arcade sort of animals about the size of rats and a couple of yorkshire tykes 
there they sat patient good and thoughtful 
a solemn peacefulness seemed to reign in that lobby 
an air of calmness and resignation  of gentle sadness pervaded the room 
then a sweet young lady entered leading a meek looking little fox terrier and left him chained up there between the bull dog and the poodle 
he sat and looked about him for a minute 
then he cast up his eyes to the ceiling and seemed judging from his expression to be thinking of his mother 
then he yawned 
then he looked round at the other dogs all silent grave and dignified 
he looked at the bull dog sleeping dreamlessly on his right 
he looked at the poodle erect and haughty on his left 
then without a word of warning without the shadow of a provocation he bit that poodle s near fore leg and a yelp of agony rang through the quiet shades of that lobby 
the result of his first experiment seemed highly satisfactory to him and he determined to go on and make things lively all round 
he sprang over the poodle and vigorously attacked a collie and the collie woke up and immediately commenced a fierce and noisy contest with the poodle 
then foxey came back to his own place and caught the bull dog by the ear and tried to throw him away and the bull dog a curiously impartial animal went for everything he could reach including the hall porter which gave that dear little terrier the opportunity to enjoy an uninterrupted fight of his own with an equally willing yorkshire tyke 
anyone who knows canine nature need hardly be told that by this time all the other dogs in the place were fighting as if their hearths and homes depended on the fray 
the big dogs fought each other indiscriminately and the little dogs fought among themselves and filled up their spare time by biting the legs of the big dogs 
the whole lobby was a perfect pandemonium and the din was terrific 
a crowd assembled outside in the haymarket and asked if it was a vestry meeting or if not who was being murdered and why 
men came with poles and ropes and tried to separate the dogs and the police were sent for 
and in the midst of the riot that sweet young lady returned and snatched up that sweet little dog of hers he had laid the tyke up for a month and had on the expression now of a new born lamb into her arms and kissed him and asked him if he was killed and what those great nasty brutes of dogs had been doing to him and he nestled up against her and gazed up into her face with a look that seemed to say oh i m so glad you ve come to take me away from this disgraceful scene  
she said that the people at the stores had no right to allow great savage things like those other dogs to be put with respectable people s dogs and that she had a great mind to summon somebody 
such is the nature of fox terriers and therefore i do not blame montmorency for his tendency to row with cats but he wished he had not given way to it that morning 
we were as i have said returning from a dip and half way up the high street a cat darted out from one of the houses in front of us and began to trot across the road 
montmorency gave a cry of joy  the cry of a stern warrior who sees his enemy given over to his hands  the sort of cry cromwell might have uttered when the scots came down the hill  and flew after his prey 
his victim was a large black tom 
i never saw a larger cat nor a more disreputable looking cat 
it had lost half its tail one of its ears and a fairly appreciable proportion of its nose 
it was a long sinewy looking animal 
it had a calm contented air about it 
montmorency went for that poor cat at the rate of twenty miles an hour but the cat did not hurry up  did not seem to have grasped the idea that its life was in danger 
it trotted quietly on until its would be assassin was within a yard of it and then it turned round and sat down in the middle of the road and looked at montmorency with a gentle inquiring expression that said  yes 
you want me  
montmorency does not lack pluck but there was something about the look of that cat that might have chilled the heart of the boldest dog 
he stopped abruptly and looked back at tom 
neither spoke but the conversation that one could imagine was clearly as follows    the cat can i do anything for you  
montmorency no  no thanks  
the cat don t you mind speaking if you really want anything you know  
montmorency  backing down the high street  oh no  not at all  certainly  don t you trouble 
i  i am afraid i ve made a mistake 
i thought i knew you 
sorry i disturbed you  
the cat not at all  quite a pleasure 
sure you don t want anything now  
montmorency  still backing  not at all thanks  not at all  very kind of you 
good morning  
the cat good morning  
then the cat rose and continued his trot and montmorency fitting what he calls his tail carefully into its groove came back to us and took up an unimportant position in the rear 
to this day if you say the word cats  
to montmorency he will visibly shrink and look up piteously at you as if to say  please don t  
we did our marketing after breakfast and revictualled the boat for three days 
george said we ought to take vegetables  that it was unhealthy not to eat vegetables 
he said they were easy enough to cook and that he would see to that so we got ten pounds of potatoes a bushel of peas and a few cabbages 
we got a beefsteak pie a couple of gooseberry tarts and a leg of mutton from the hotel and fruit and cakes and bread and butter and jam and bacon and eggs and other things we foraged round about the town for 
our departure from marlow i regard as one of our greatest successes 
it was dignified and impressive without being ostentatious 
we had insisted at all the shops we had been to that the things should be sent with us then and there 
none of your yes sir i will send them off at once the boy will be down there before you are sir  
and then fooling about on the landing stage and going back to the shop twice to have a row about them for us 
we waited while the basket was packed and took the boy with us 
we went to a good many shops adopting this principle at each one and the consequence was that by the time we had finished we had as fine a collection of boys with baskets following us around as heart could desire and our final march down the middle of the high street to the river must have been as imposing a spectacle as marlow had seen for many a long day 
the order of the procession was as follows    montmorency carrying a stick 
two disreputable looking curs friends of montmorency s 
george carrying coats and rugs and smoking a short pipe 
harris trying to walk with easy grace while carrying a bulged out gladstone bag in one hand and a bottle of lime juice in the other 
greengrocer s boy and baker s boy with baskets 
boots from the hotel carrying hamper 
confectioner s boy with basket 
grocer s boy with basket 
long haired dog 
cheesemonger s boy with basket 
odd man carrying a bag 
bosom companion of odd man with his hands in his pockets smoking a short clay 
fruiterer s boy with basket 
myself carrying three hats and a pair of boots and trying to look as if i didn t know it 
six small boys and four stray dogs 
when we got down to the landing stage the boatman said  let me see sir was yours a steam launch or a house boat  
 picture the bring of the provisions on our informing him it was a double sculling skiff he seemed surprised 
we had a good deal of trouble with steam launches that morning 
it was just before the henley week and they were going up in large numbers some by themselves some towing houseboats 
i do hate steam launches i suppose every rowing man does 
i never see a steam launch but i feel i should like to lure it to a lonely part of the river and there in the silence and the solitude strangle it 
there is a blatant bumptiousness about a steam launch that has the knack of rousing every evil instinct in my nature and i yearn for the good old days when you could go about and tell people what you thought of them with a hatchet and a bow and arrows 
the expression on the face of the man who with his hands in his pockets stands by the stern smoking a cigar is sufficient to excuse a breach of the peace by itself and the lordly whistle for you to get out of the way would i am confident ensure a verdict of justifiable homicide from any jury of river men 
they used to  have  to whistle for us to get out of their way 
if i may do so without appearing boastful i think i can honestly say that our one small boat during that week caused more annoyance and delay and aggravation to the steam launches that we came across than all the other craft on the river put together 
 steam launch coming  
one of us would cry out on sighting the enemy in the distance and in an instant everything was got ready to receive her 
i would take the lines and harris and george would sit down beside me all of us with our backs to the launch and the boat would drift out quietly into mid stream 
on would come the launch whistling and on we would go drifting 
at about a hundred yards off she would start whistling like mad and the people would come and lean over the side and roar at us but we never heard them 
harris would be telling us an anecdote about his mother and george and i would not have missed a word of it for worlds 
then that launch would give one final shriek of a whistle that would nearly burst the boiler and she would reverse her engines and blow off steam and swing round and get aground everyone on board of it would rush to the bow and yell at us and the people on the bank would stand and shout to us and all the other passing boats would stop and join in till the whole river for miles up and down was in a state of frantic commotion 
and then harris would break off in the most interesting part of his narrative and look up with mild surprise and say to george  why george bless me if here isn t a steam launch  
and george would answer  well do you know i  thought  i heard something  
upon which we would get nervous and confused and not know how to get the boat out of the way and the people in the launch would crowd round and instruct us  pull your right  you you idiot 
back with your left 
no not you  the other one  leave the lines alone can t you  now both together 
not  that  way 
oh you    
then they would lower a boat and come to our assistance and after quarter of an hour s effort would get us clean out of their way so that they could go on and we would thank them so much and ask them to give us a tow 
but they never would 
another good way we discovered of irritating the aristocratic type of steam launch was to mistake them for a beanfeast and ask them if they were messrs cubit s lot or the bermondsey good templars and could they lend us a saucepan 
old ladies not accustomed to the river are always intensely nervous of steam launches 
i remember going up once from staines to windsor  a stretch of water peculiarly rich in these mechanical monstrosities  with a party containing three ladies of this description 
it was very exciting 
at the first glimpse of every steam launch that came in view they insisted on landing and sitting down on the bank until it was out of sight again 
they said they were very sorry but that they owed it to their families not to be fool hardy 
we found ourselves short of water at hambledon lock so we took our jar and went up to the lock keeper s house to beg for some 
george was our spokesman 
he put on a winning smile and said  oh please could you spare us a little water  
 certainly  replied the old gentleman take as much as you want and leave the rest  
 thank you so much  murmured george looking about him 
 where  where do you keep it  
 it s always in the same place my boy  was the stolid reply just behind you  
 i don t see it  said george turning round 
 why bless us where s your eyes  
was the man s comment as he twisted george round and pointed up and down the stream 
 there s enough of it to see ain t there  
 oh  
exclaimed george grasping the idea but we can t drink the river you know  
 no but you can drink  some  of it  replied the old fellow 
 it s what i ve  drunk for the last fifteen years  
george told him that his appearance after the course did not seem a sufficiently good advertisement for the brand and that he would prefer it out of a pump 
we got some from a cottage a little higher up 
i daresay  that  was only river water if we had known 
but we did not know so it was all right 
what the eye does not see the stomach does not get upset over 
we tried river water once later on in the season but it was not a success 
we were coming down stream and had pulled up to have tea in a backwater near windsor 
our jar was empty and it was a case of going without our tea or taking water from the river 
harris was for chancing it 
he said it must be all right if we boiled the water 
he said that the various germs of poison present in the water would be killed by the boiling 
so we filled our kettle with thames backwater and boiled it and very careful we were to see that it did boil 
we had made the tea and were just settling down comfortably to drink it when george with his cup half way to his lips paused and exclaimed  what s that  
 what s what  
asked harris and i 
 why that  
said george looking westward 
 picture the dog harris and i followed his gaze and saw coming down towards us on the sluggish current a dog 
it was one of the quietest and peacefullest dogs i have ever seen 
i never met a dog who seemed more contented  more easy in its mind 
it was floating dreamily on its back with its four legs stuck up straight into the air 
it was what i should call a full bodied dog with a well developed chest 
on he came serene dignified and calm until he was abreast of our boat and there among the rushes he eased up and settled down cosily for the evening 
george said he didn t want any tea and emptied his cup into the water 
harris did not feel thirsty either and followed suit 
i had drunk half mine but i wished i had not 
i asked george if he thought i was likely to have typhoid 
he said oh no  he thought i had a very good chance indeed of escaping it 
anyhow i should know in about a fortnight whether i had or had not 
we went up the backwater to wargrave 
it is a short cut leading out of the right hand bank about half a mile above marsh lock and is well worth taking being a pretty shady little piece of stream besides saving nearly half a mile of distance 
of course its entrance is studded with posts and chains and surrounded with notice boards menacing all kinds of torture imprisonment and death to everyone who dares set scull upon its waters  i wonder some of these riparian boors don t claim the air of the river and threaten everyone with forty shillings fine who breathes it  but the posts and chains a little skill will easily avoid and as for the boards you might if you have five minutes to spare and there is nobody about take one or two of them down and throw them into the river 
half way up the backwater we got out and lunched and it was during this lunch that george and i received rather a trying shock 
harris received a shock too but i do not think harris s shock could have been anything like so bad as the shock that george and i had over the business 
you see it was in this way we were sitting in a meadow about ten yards from the water s edge and we had just settled down comfortably to feed 
harris had the beefsteak pie between his knees and was carving it and george and i were waiting with our plates ready 
 have you got a spoon there  
says harris i want a spoon to help the gravy with  
the hamper was close behind us and george and i both turned round to reach one out 
we were not five seconds getting it 
when we looked round again harris and the pie were gone 
it was a wide open field 
there was not a tree or a bit of hedge for hundreds of yards 
he could not have tumbled into the river because we were on the water side of him and he would have had to climb over us to do it 
george and i gazed all about 
then we gazed at each other 
 has he been snatched up to heaven  
i queried 
 they d hardly have taken the pie too  said george 
there seemed weight in this objection and we discarded the heavenly theory 
 i suppose the truth of the matter is  suggested george descending to the commonplace and practicable that there has been an earthquake  
and then he added with a touch of sadness in his voice i wish he hadn t been carving that pie  
with a sigh we turned our eyes once more towards the spot where harris and the pie had last been seen on earth and there as our blood froze in our veins and our hair stood up on end we saw harris s head  and nothing but his head  sticking bolt upright among the tall grass the face very red and bearing upon it an expression of great indignation 
george was the first to recover 
 speak  
he cried and tell us whether you are alive or dead  and where is the rest of you  
 oh don t be a stupid ass  
said harris s head 
 i believe you did it on purpose  
 did what  
exclaimed george and i 
 why put me to sit here  darn silly trick 
here catch hold of the pie  
 picture rescuing the pie and out of the middle of the earth as it seemed to us rose the pie  very much mixed up and damaged and after it scrambled harris  tumbled grubby and wet 
he had been sitting without knowing it on the very verge of a small gully the long grass hiding it from view and in leaning a little back he had shot over pie and all 
he said he had never felt so surprised in all his life as when he first felt himself going without being able to conjecture in the slightest what had happened 
he thought at first that the end of the world had come 
harris believes to this day that george and i planned it all beforehand 
thus does unjust suspicion follow even the most blameless for as the poet says who shall escape calumny  
who indeed

we caught a breeze after lunch which took us gently up past wargrave and shiplake 
mellowed in the drowsy sunlight of a summer s afternoon wargrave nestling where the river bends makes a sweet old picture as you pass it and one that lingers long upon the retina of memory 
the george and dragon at wargrave boasts a sign painted on the one side by leslie r a  and on the other by hodgson of that ilk

in the church is a memorial to mrs sarah hill who bequeathed  pound annually to be divided at easter between two boys and two girls who have never been undutiful to their parents who have never been known to swear or to tell untruths to steal or to break windows  
fancy giving up all that for five shillings a year 
it is not worth it 
it is rumoured in the town that once many years ago a boy appeared who really never had done these things  or at all events which was all that was required or could be expected had never been known to do them  and thus won the crown of glory 
he was exhibited for three weeks afterwards in the town hall under a glass case 
what has become of the money since no one knows 
they say it is always handed over to the nearest wax works show 
shiplake is a pretty village but it cannot be seen from the river being upon the hill 
tennyson was married in shiplake church 
the river up to sonning winds in and out through many islands and is very placid hushed and lonely 
few folk except at twilight a pair or two of rustic lovers walk along its banks 
 arry and lord fitznoodle have been left behind at henley and dismal dirty reading is not yet reached 
it is a part of the river in which to dream of bygone days and vanished forms and faces and things that might have been but are not confound them 
we got out at sonning and went for a walk round the village 
it is the most fairy like little nook on the whole river 
it is more like a stage village than one built of bricks and mortar 
every house is smothered in roses and now in early june they were bursting forth in clouds of dainty splendour 
if you stop at sonning put up at the bull  behind the church 
it is a veritable picture of an old country inn with green square courtyard in front where on seats beneath the trees the old men group of an evening to drink their ale and gossip over village politics with low quaint rooms and latticed windows and awkward stairs and winding passages 
we roamed about sweet sonning for an hour or so and then it being too late to push on past reading we decided to go back to one of the shiplake islands and put up there for the night 
it was still early when we got settled and george said that as we had plenty of time it would be a splendid opportunity to try a good slap up supper 
he said he would show us what could be done up the river in the way of cooking and suggested that with the vegetables and the remains of the cold beef and general odds and ends we should make an irish stew 
it seemed a fascinating idea 
george gathered wood and made a fire and harris and i started to peel the potatoes 
i should never have thought that peeling potatoes was such an undertaking 
the job turned out to be the biggest thing of its kind that i had ever been in 
we began cheerfully one might almost say skittishly but our light heartedness was gone by the time the first potato was finished 
the more we peeled the more peel there seemed to be left on by the time we had got all the peel off and all the eyes out there was no potato left  at least none worth speaking of 
george came and had a look at it  it was about the size of a pea nut 
he said  oh that won t do 
you re wasting them 
you must scrape them  
so we scraped them and that was harder work than peeling 
they are such an extraordinary shape potatoes  all bumps and warts and hollows 
we worked steadily for five and twenty minutes and did four potatoes 
then we struck 
we said we should require the rest of the evening for scraping ourselves 
i never saw such a thing as potato scraping for making a fellow in a mess 
it seemed difficult to believe that the potato scrapings in which harris and i stood half smothered could have come off four potatoes 
it shows you what can be done with economy and care 
george said it was absurd to have only four potatoes in an irish stew so we washed half a dozen or so more and put them in without peeling 
we also put in a cabbage and about half a peck of peas 
george stirred it all up and then he said that there seemed to be a lot of room to spare so we overhauled both the hampers and picked out all the odds and ends and the remnants and added them to the stew 
there were half a pork pie and a bit of cold boiled bacon left and we put them in 
then george found half a tin of potted salmon and he emptied that into the pot 
he said that was the advantage of irish stew you got rid of such a lot of things 
i fished out a couple of eggs that had got cracked and put those in 
george said they would thicken the gravy 
i forget the other ingredients but i know nothing was wasted and i remember that towards the end montmorency who had evinced great interest in the proceedings throughout strolled away with an earnest and thoughtful air reappearing a few minutes afterwards with a dead water rat in his mouth which he evidently wished to present as his contribution to the dinner whether in a sarcastic spirit or with a genuine desire to assist i cannot say 
we had a discussion as to whether the rat should go in or not 
harris said that he thought it would be all right mixed up with the other things and that every little helped but george stood up for precedent 
he said he had never heard of water rats in irish stew and he would rather be on the safe side and not try experiments 
harris said  if you never try a new thing how can you tell what it s like 
it s men such as you that hamper the world s progress 
think of the man who first tried german sausage  
it was a great success that irish stew 
i don t think i ever enjoyed a meal more 
there was something so fresh and piquant about it 
one s palate gets so tired of the old hackneyed things here was a dish with a new flavour with a taste like nothing else on earth 
and it was nourishing too 
as george said there was good stuff in it 
the peas and potatoes might have been a bit softer but we all had good teeth so that did not matter much and as for the gravy it was a poem  a little too rich perhaps for a weak stomach but nutritious 
we finished up with tea and cherry tart 
montmorency had a fight with the kettle during tea time and came off a poor second 
throughout the trip he had manifested great curiosity concerning the kettle 
he would sit and watch it as it boiled with a puzzled expression and would try and rouse it every now and then by growling at it 
when it began to splutter and steam he regarded it as a challenge and would want to fight it only at that precise moment some one would always dash up and bear off his prey before he could get at it 
to day he determined he would be beforehand 
at the first sound the kettle made he rose growling and advanced towards it in a threatening attitude 
it was only a little kettle but it was full of pluck and it up and spit at him 
 picture montmorency and the kettle ah 
would ye  
growled montmorency showing his teeth i ll teach ye to cheek a hard working respectable dog ye miserable long nosed dirty looking scoundrel ye 
come on  
and he rushed at that poor little kettle and seized it by the spout 
then across the evening stillness broke a blood curdling yelp and montmorency left the boat and did a constitutional three times round the island at the rate of thirty five miles an hour stopping every now and then to bury his nose in a bit of cool mud 
from that day montmorency regarded the kettle with a mixture of awe suspicion and hate 
whenever he saw it he would growl and back at a rapid rate with his tail shut down and the moment it was put upon the stove he would promptly climb out of the boat and sit on the bank till the whole tea business was over 
george got out his banjo after supper and wanted to play it but harris objected he said he had got a headache and did not feel strong enough to stand it 
george thought the music might do him good  said music often soothed the nerves and took away a headache and he twanged two or three notes just to show harris what it was like 
harris said he would rather have the headache 
george has never learned to play the banjo to this day 
he has had too much all round discouragement to meet 
he tried on two or three evenings while we were up the river to get a little practice but it was never a success 
harris s language used to be enough to unnerve any man added to which montmorency would sit and howl steadily right through the performance 
it was not giving the man a fair chance 
 what s he want to howl like that for when i m playing  
george would exclaim indignantly while taking aim at him with a boot 
 what do you want to play like that for when he is howling  
harris would retort catching the boot 
 you let him alone 
he can t help howling 
he s got a musical ear and your playing  makes  him howl  
so george determined to postpone study of the banjo until he reached home 
but he did not get much opportunity even there 
mrs p used to come up and say she was very sorry  for herself she liked to hear him  but the lady upstairs was in a very delicate state and the doctor was afraid it might injure the child 
then george tried taking it out with him late at night and practising round the square 
but the inhabitants complained to the police about it and a watch was set for him one night and he was captured 
the evidence against him was very clear and he was bound over to keep the peace for six months 
he seemed to lose heart in the business after that 
he did make one or two feeble efforts to take up the work again when the six months had elapsed but there was always the same coldness  the same want of sympathy on the part of the world to fight against and after awhile he despaired altogether and advertised the instrument for sale at a great sacrifice   owner having no further use for same   and took to learning card tricks instead 
it must be disheartening work learning a musical instrument 
you would think that society for its own sake would do all it could to assist a man to acquire the art of playing a musical instrument 
but it doesn t 
i knew a young fellow once who was studying to play the bagpipes and you would be surprised at the amount of opposition he had to contend with 
why not even from the members of his own family did he receive what you could call active encouragement 
his father was dead against the business from the beginning and spoke quite unfeelingly on the subject 
my friend used to get up early in the morning to practise but he had to give that plan up because of his sister 
she was somewhat religiously inclined and she said it seemed such an awful thing to begin the day like that 
so he sat up at night instead and played after the family had gone to bed but that did not do as it got the house such a bad name 
people going home late would stop outside to listen and then put it about all over the town the next morning that a fearful murder had been committed at mr jefferson s the night before and would describe how they had heard the victim s shrieks and the brutal oaths and curses of the murderer followed by the prayer for mercy and the last dying gurgle of the corpse 
so they let him practise in the day time in the back kitchen with all the doors shut but his more successful passages could generally be heard in the sitting room in spite of these precautions and would affect his mother almost to tears 
she said it put her in mind of her poor father he had been swallowed by a shark poor man while bathing off the coast of new guinea  where the connection came in she could not explain  
then they knocked up a little place for him at the bottom of the garden about quarter of a mile from the house and made him take the machine down there when he wanted to work it and sometimes a visitor would come to the house who knew nothing of the matter and they would forget to tell him all about it and caution him and he would go out for a stroll round the garden and suddenly get within earshot of those bagpipes without being prepared for it or knowing what it was 
if he were a man of strong mind it only gave him fits but a person of mere average intellect it usually sent mad 
there is it must be confessed something very sad about the early efforts of an amateur in bagpipes 
i have felt that myself when listening to my young friend 
they appear to be a trying instrument to perform upon 
you have to get enough breath for the whole tune before you start  at least so i gathered from watching jefferson 
he would begin magnificently with a wild full come to the battle sort of a note that quite roused you 
but he would get more and more piano as he went on and the last verse generally collapsed in the middle with a splutter and a hiss 
you want to be in good health to play the bagpipes 
young jefferson only learnt to play one tune on those bagpipes but i never heard any complaints about the insufficiency of his repertoire  none whatever 
this tune was the campbells are coming hooray  hooray  
so he said though his father always held that it was the blue bells of scotland  
nobody seemed quite sure what it was exactly but they all agreed that it sounded scotch 
strangers were allowed three guesses and most of them guessed a different tune each time 
harris was disagreeable after supper   i think it must have been the stew that had upset him he is not used to high living   so george and i left him in the boat and settled to go for a mouch round henley 
he said he should have a glass of whisky and a pipe and fix things up for the night 
we were to shout when we returned and he would row over from the island and fetch us 
 don t go to sleep old man  we said as we started 
 not much fear of that while this stew s on  he grunted as he pulled back to the island 
henley was getting ready for the regatta and was full of bustle 
we met a goodish number of men we knew about the town and in their pleasant company the time slipped by somewhat quickly so that it was nearly eleven o clock before we set off on our four mile walk home  as we had learned to call our little craft by this time 
it was a dismal night coldish with a thin rain falling and as we trudged through the dark silent fields talking low to each other and wondering if we were going right or not we thought of the cosy boat with the bright light streaming through the tight drawn canvas of harris and montmorency and the whisky and wished that we were there 
we conjured up the picture of ourselves inside tired and a little hungry of the gloomy river and the shapeless trees and like a giant glow worm underneath them our dear old boat so snug and warm and cheerful 
we could see ourselves at supper there pecking away at cold meat and passing each other chunks of bread we could hear the cheery clatter of our knives the laughing voices filling all the space and overflowing through the opening out into the night 
and we hurried on to realise the vision 
we struck the tow path at length and that made us happy because prior to this we had not been sure whether we were walking towards the river or away from it and when you are tired and want to go to bed uncertainties like that worry you 
we passed skiplake as the clock was striking the quarter to twelve and then george said thoughtfully  you don t happen to remember which of the islands it was do you  
 no  i replied beginning to grow thoughtful too i don t 
how many are there  
 only four  answered george 
 it will be all right if he s awake  
 and if not  
i queried but we dismissed that train of thought 
we shouted when we came opposite the first island but there was no response so we went to the second and tried there and obtained the same result 
 oh 
i remember now  said george it was the third one  
and we ran on hopefully to the third one and hallooed 
no answer 
the case was becoming serious 
it was now past midnight 
the hotels at skiplake and henley would be crammed and we could not go round knocking up cottagers and householders in the middle of the night to know if they let apartments 
george suggested walking back to henley and assaulting a policeman and so getting a night s lodging in the station house 
but then there was the thought suppose he only hits us back and refuses to lock us up  
we could not pass the whole night fighting policemen 
besides we did not want to overdo the thing and get six months 
we despairingly tried what seemed in the darkness to be the fourth island but met with no better success 
the rain was coming down fast now and evidently meant to last 
we were wet to the skin and cold and miserable 
we began to wonder whether there were only four islands or more or whether we were near the islands at all or whether we were anywhere within a mile of where we ought to be or in the wrong part of the river altogether everything looked so strange and different in the darkness 
we began to understand the sufferings of the babes in the wood 
just when we had given up all hope  yes i know that is always the time that things do happen in novels and tales but i can t help it 
i resolved when i began to write this book that i would be strictly truthful in all things and so i will be even if i have to employ hackneyed phrases for the purpose 
it  was  just when we had given up all hope and i must therefore say so 
just when we had given up all hope then i suddenly caught sight a little way below us of a strange weird sort of glimmer flickering among the trees on the opposite bank 
for an instant i thought of ghosts it was such a shadowy mysterious light 
the next moment it flashed across me that it was our boat and i sent up such a yell across the water that made the night seem to shake in its bed 
we waited breathless for a minute and then  oh 
divinest music of the darkness   we heard the answering bark of montmorency 
we shouted back loud enough to wake the seven sleepers  i never could understand myself why it should take more noise to wake seven sleepers than one  and after what seemed an hour but what was really i suppose about five minutes we saw the lighted boat creeping slowly over the blackness and heard harris s sleepy voice asking where we were 
there was an unaccountable strangeness about harris 
it was something more than mere ordinary tiredness 
he pulled the boat against a part of the bank from which it was quite impossible for us to get into it and immediately went to sleep 
it took us an immense amount of screaming and roaring to wake him up again and put some sense into him but we succeeded at last and got safely on board 
harris had a sad expression on him so we noticed when we got into the boat 
he gave you the idea of a man who had been through trouble 
we asked him if anything had happened and he said   picture swans swans  
it seemed we had moored close to a swan s nest and soon after george and i had gone the female swan came back and kicked up a row about it 
harris had chivied her off and she had gone away and fetched up her old man 
harris said he had had quite a fight with these two swans but courage and skill had prevailed in the end and he had defeated them 
half an hour afterwards they returned with eighteen other swans 
it must have been a fearful battle so far as we could understand harris s account of it 
the swans had tried to drag him and montmorency out of the boat and drown them and he had defended himself like a hero for four hours and had killed the lot and they had all paddled away to die 
 how many swans did you say there were  
asked george 
 thirty two  replied harris sleepily 
 you said eighteen just now  said george 
 no i didn t  grunted harris i said twelve 
think i can t count  
what were the real facts about these swans we never found out 
we questioned harris on the subject in the morning and he said what swans  
and seemed to think that george and i had been dreaming 
oh how delightful it was to be safe in the boat after our trials and fears 
we ate a hearty supper george and i and we should have had some toddy after it if we could have found the whisky but we could not 
we examined harris as to what he had done with it but he did not seem to know what we meant by whisky  or what we were talking about at all 
montmorency looked as if he knew something but said nothing 
i slept well that night and should have slept better if it had not been for harris 
i have a vague recollection of having been woke up at least a dozen times during the night by harris wandering about the boat with the lantern looking for his clothes 
he seemed to be worrying about his clothes all night 
twice he routed up george and myself to see if we were lying on his trousers 
george got quite wild the second time 
 what the thunder do you want your trousers for in the middle of the night  
he asked indignantly 
 why don t you lie down and go to sleep  
i found him in trouble the next time i awoke because he could not find his socks and my last hazy remembrance is of being rolled over on my side and of hearing harris muttering something about its being an extraordinary thing where his umbrella could have got to 
chapter xv 
household duties   love of work   the old river hand what he does and what he tells you he has done   scepticism of the new generation   early boating recollections   rafting   george does the thing in style   the old boatman his method   so calm so full of peace   the beginner   punting   a sad accident   pleasures of friendship   sailing my first experience   possible reason why we were not drowned 
 picture woman at housework we woke late the next morning and at harris s earnest desire partook of a plain breakfast with non dainties  
then we cleaned up and put everything straight a continual labour which was beginning to afford me a pretty clear insight into a question that had often posed me  namely how a woman with the work of only one house on her hands manages to pass away her time  and at about ten set out on what we had determined should be a good day s journey 
we agreed that we would pull this morning as a change from towing and harris thought the best arrangement would be that george and i should scull and he steer 
i did not chime in with this idea at all i said i thought harris would have been showing a more proper spirit if he had suggested that he and george should work and let me rest a bit 
it seemed to me that i was doing more than my fair share of the work on this trip and i was beginning to feel strongly on the subject 
it always does seem to me that i am doing more work than i should do 
it is not that i object to the work mind you i like work it fascinates me 
i can sit and look at it for hours 
i love to keep it by me the idea of getting rid of it nearly breaks my heart 
you cannot give me too much work to accumulate work has almost become a passion with me my study is so full of it now that there is hardly an inch of room for any more 
i shall have to throw out a wing soon 
and i am careful of my work too 
why some of the work that i have by me now has been in my possession for years and years and there isn t a finger mark on it 
i take a great pride in my work i take it down now and then and dust it 
no man keeps his work in a better state of preservation than i do 
but though i crave for work i still like to be fair 
i do not ask for more than my proper share 
but i get it without asking for it  at least so it appears to me  and this worries me 
george says he does not think i need trouble myself on the subject 
he thinks it is only my over scrupulous nature that makes me fear i am having more than my due and that as a matter of fact i don t have half as much as i ought 
but i expect he only says this to comfort me 
in a boat i have always noticed that it is the fixed idea of each member of the crew that he is doing everything 
harris s notion was that it was he alone who had been working and that both george and i had been imposing upon him 
george on the other hand ridiculed the idea of harris s having done anything more than eat and sleep and had a cast iron opinion that it was he  george himself  who had done all the labour worth speaking of 
he said he had never been out with such a couple of lazily skulks as harris and i 
that amused harris 
 fancy old george talking about work  
he laughed why about half an hour of it would kill him 
have you ever seen george work  
he added turning to me 
i agreed with harris that i never had  most certainly not since we had started on this trip 
 well i don t see how  you  can know much about it one way or the other  george retorted on harris for i m blest if you haven t been asleep half the time 
have you ever seen harris fully awake except at meal time  
asked george addressing me 
truth compelled me to support george 
harris had been very little good in the boat so far as helping was concerned from the beginning 
 well hang it all i ve done more than old j  anyhow  rejoined harris 
 well you couldn t very well have done less  added george 
 i suppose j thinks he is the passenger  continued harris 
and that was their gratitude to me for having brought them and their wretched old boat all the way up from kingston and for having superintended and managed everything for them and taken care of them and slaved for them 
it is the way of the world 
we settled the present difficulty by arranging that harris and george should scull up past reading and that i should tow the boat on from there 
pulling a heavy boat against a strong stream has few attractions for me now 
there was a time long ago when i used to clamour for the hard work now i like to give the youngsters a chance 
i notice that most of the old river hands are similarly retiring whenever there is any stiff pulling to be done 
you can always tell the old river hand by the way in which he stretches himself out upon the cushions at the bottom of the boat and encourages the rowers by telling them anecdotes about the marvellous feats he performed last season 
 call what you re doing hard work  
he drawls between his contented whiffs addressing the two perspiring novices who have been grinding away steadily up stream for the last hour and a half why jim biffles and jack and i last season pulled up from marlow to goring in one afternoon  never stopped once 
do you remember that jack  
jack who has made himself a bed up in the prow of all the rugs and coats he can collect and who has been lying there asleep for the last two hours partially wakes up on being thus appealed to and recollects all about the matter and also remembers that there was an unusually strong stream against them all the way  likewise a stiff wind 
 about thirty four miles i suppose it must have been  adds the first speaker reaching down another cushion to put under his head 
 no  no don t exaggerate tom  murmurs jack reprovingly thirty three at the outside  
and jack and tom quite exhausted by this conversational effort drop off to sleep once more 
and the two simple minded youngsters at the sculls feel quite proud of being allowed to row such wonderful oarsmen as jack and tom and strain away harder than ever 
when i was a young man i used to listen to these tales from my elders and take them in and swallow them and digest every word of them and then come up for more but the new generation do not seem to have the simple faith of the old times 
we  george harris and myself  took a raw un up with us once last season and we plied him with the customary stretchers about the wonderful things we had done all the way up 
we gave him all the regular ones  the time honoured lies that have done duty up the river with every boating man for years past  and added seven entirely original ones that we had invented for ourselves including a really quite likely story founded to a certain extent on an all but true episode which had actually happened in a modified degree some years ago to friends of ours  a story that a mere child could have believed without injuring itself much 
and that young man mocked at them all and wanted us to repeat the feats then and there and to bet us ten to one that we didn t 
we got to chatting about our rowing experiences this morning and to recounting stories of our first efforts in the art of oarsmanship 
my own earliest boating recollection is of five of us contributing threepence each and taking out a curiously constructed craft on the regent s park lake drying ourselves subsequently in the park keeper s lodge 
after that having acquired a taste for the water i did a good deal of rafting in various suburban brickfields  an exercise providing more interest and excitement than might be imagined especially when you are in the middle of the pond and the proprietor of the materials of which the raft is constructed suddenly appears on the bank with a big stick in his hand 
your first sensation on seeing this gentleman is that somehow or other you don t feel equal to company and conversation and that if you could do so without appearing rude you would rather avoid meeting him and your object is therefore to get off on the opposite side of the pond to which he is and to go home quietly and quickly pretending not to see him 
he on the contrary is yearning to take you by the hand and talk to you 
it appears that he knows your father and is intimately acquainted with yourself but this does not draw you towards him 
he says he ll teach you to take his boards and make a raft of them but seeing that you know how to do this pretty well already the offer though doubtless kindly meant seems a superfluous one on his part and you are reluctant to put him to any trouble by accepting it 
his anxiety to meet you however is proof against all your coolness and the energetic manner in which he dodges up and down the pond so as to be on the spot to greet you when you land is really quite flattering 
if he be of a stout and short winded build you can easily avoid his advances but when he is of the youthful and long legged type a meeting is inevitable 
the interview is however extremely brief most of the conversation being on his part your remarks being mostly of an exclamatory and mono syllabic order and as soon as you can tear yourself away you do so 
i devoted some three months to rafting and being then as proficient as there was any need to be at that branch of the art i determined to go in for rowing proper and joined one of the lea boating clubs 
being out in a boat on the river lea especially on saturday afternoons soon makes you smart at handling a craft and spry at escaping being run down by roughs or swamped by barges and it also affords plenty of opportunity for acquiring the most prompt and graceful method of lying down flat at the bottom of the boat so as to avoid being chucked out into the river by passing tow lines 
but it does not give you style 
it was not till i came to the thames that i got style 
my style of rowing is very much admired now 
people say it is so quaint 
george never went near the water until he was sixteen 
then he and eight other gentlemen of about the same age went down in a body to kew one saturday with the idea of hiring a boat there and pulling to richmond and back one of their number a shock headed youth named joskins who had once or twice taken out a boat on the serpentine told them it was jolly fun boating 
the tide was running out pretty rapidly when they reached the landing stage and there was a stiff breeze blowing across the river but this did not trouble them at all and they proceeded to select their boat 
there was an eight oared racing outrigger drawn up on the stage that was the one that took their fancy 
they said they d have that one please 
the boatman was away and only his boy was in charge 
the boy tried to damp their ardour for the outrigger and showed them two or three very comfortable looking boats of the family party build but those would not do at all the outrigger was the boat they thought they would look best in 
so the boy launched it and they took off their coats and prepared to take their seats 
the boy suggested that george who even in those days was always the heavy man of any party should be number four 
george said he should be happy to be number four and promptly stepped into bow s place and sat down with his back to the stern 
they got him into his proper position at last and then the others followed 
a particularly nervous boy was appointed cox and the steering principle explained to him by joskins 
joskins himself took stroke 
he told the others that it was simple enough all they had to do was to follow him 
they said they were ready and the boy on the landing stage took a boat hook and shoved him off 
what then followed george is unable to describe in detail 
he has a confused recollection of having immediately on starting received a violent blow in the small of the back from the butt end of number five s scull at the same time that his own seat seemed to disappear from under him by magic and leave him sitting on the boards 
he also noticed as a curious circumstance that number two was at the same instant lying on his back at the bottom of the boat with his legs in the air apparently in a fit 
they passed under kew bridge broadside at the rate of eight miles an hour 
joskins being the only one who was rowing 
george on recovering his seat tried to help him but on dipping his oar into the water it immediately to his intense surprise disappeared under the boat and nearly took him with it 
and then cox threw both rudder lines over board and burst into tears 
how they got back george never knew but it took them just forty minutes 
a dense crowd watched the entertainment from kew bridge with much interest and everybody shouted out to them different directions 
three times they managed to get the boat back through the arch and three times they were carried under it again and every time cox looked up and saw the bridge above him he broke out into renewed sobs 
george said he little thought that afternoon that he should ever come to really like boating 
harris is more accustomed to sea rowing than to river work and says that as an exercise he prefers it 
i don t 
i remember taking a small boat out at eastbourne last summer i used to do a good deal of sea rowing years ago and i thought i should be all right but i found i had forgotten the art entirely 
when one scull was deep down underneath the water the other would be flourishing wildly about in the air 
to get a grip of the water with both at the same time i had to stand up 
the parade was crowded with nobility and gentry and i had to pull past them in this ridiculous fashion 
i landed half way down the beach and secured the services of an old boatman to take me back 
i like to watch an old boatman rowing especially one who has been hired by the hour 
there is something so beautifully calm and restful about his method 
it is so free from that fretful haste that vehement striving that is every day becoming more and more the bane of nineteenth century life 
he is not for ever straining himself to pass all the other boats 
if another boat overtakes him and passes him it does not annoy him as a matter of fact they all do overtake him and pass him  all those that are going his way 
this would trouble and irritate some people the sublime equanimity of the hired boatman under the ordeal affords us a beautiful lesson against ambition and uppishness 
plain practical rowing of the get the boat along order is not a very difficult art to acquire but it takes a good deal of practice before a man feels comfortable when rowing past girls 
it is the time that worries a youngster 
 it s jolly funny  he says as for the twentieth time within five minutes he disentangles his sculls from yours i can get on all right when i m by myself  
to see two novices try to keep time with one another is very amusing 
bow finds it impossible to keep pace with stroke because stroke rows in such an extraordinary fashion 
stroke is intensely indignant at this and explains that what he has been endeavouring to do for the last ten minutes is to adapt his method to bow s limited capacity 
bow in turn then becomes insulted and requests stroke not to trouble his head about him bow  but to devote his mind to setting a sensible stroke 
 picture two novices in a boat  or shall  i  take stroke  
he adds with the evident idea that that would at once put the whole matter right 
they splash along for another hundred yards with still moderate success and then the whole secret of their trouble bursts upon stroke like a flash of inspiration 
 i tell you what it is you ve got my sculls  he cries turning to bow pass yours over  
 well do you know i ve been wondering how it was i couldn t get on with these  answers bow quite brightening up and most willingly assisting in the exchange  
now  we shall be all right  
but they are not  not even then 
stroke has to stretch his arms nearly out of their sockets to reach his sculls now while bow s pair at each recovery hit him a violent blow in the chest 
so they change back again and come to the conclusion that the man has given them the wrong set altogether and over their mutual abuse of this man they become quite friendly and sympathetic 
george said he had often longed to take to punting for a change 
punting is not as easy as it looks 
as in rowing you soon learn how to get along and handle the craft but it takes long practice before you can do this with dignity and without getting the water all up your sleeve 
one young man i knew had a very sad accident happen to him the first time he went punting 
he had been getting on so well that he had grown quite cheeky over the business and was walking up and down the punt working his pole with a careless grace that was quite fascinating to watch 
up he would march to the head of the punt plant his pole and then run along right to the other end just like an old punter 
oh 
it was grand 
 picture man and pole and it would all have gone on being grand if he had not unfortunately while looking round to enjoy the scenery taken just one step more than there was any necessity for and walked off the punt altogether 
the pole was firmly fixed in the mud and he was left clinging to it while the punt drifted away 
it was an undignified position for him 
a rude boy on the bank immediately yelled out to a lagging chum to hurry up and see a real monkey on a stick  
i could not go to his assistance because as ill luck would have it we had not taken the proper precaution to bring out a spare pole with us 
i could only sit and look at him 
his expression as the pole slowly sank with him i shall never forget there was so much thought in it 
i watched him gently let down into the water and saw him scramble out sad and wet 
i could not help laughing he looked such a ridiculous figure 
i continued to chuckle to myself about it for some time and then it was suddenly forced in upon me that really i had got very little to laugh at when i came to think of it 
here was i alone in a punt without a pole drifting helplessly down mid stream  possibly towards a weir 
i began to feel very indignant with my friend for having stepped overboard and gone off in that way 
he might at all events have left me the pole 
i drifted on for about a quarter of a mile and then i came in sight of a fishing punt moored in mid stream in which sat two old fishermen 
they saw me bearing down upon them and they called out to me to keep out of their way 
 i can t  i shouted back 
 but you don t try  they answered 
i explained the matter to them when i got nearer and they caught me and lent me a pole 
the weir was just fifty yards below 
i am glad they happened to be there 
the first time i went punting was in company with three other fellows they were going to show me how to do it 
we could not all start together so i said i would go down first and get out the punt and then i could potter about and practice a bit until they came 
i could not get a punt out that afternoon they were all engaged so i had nothing else to do but to sit down on the bank watching the river and waiting for my friends 
i had not been sitting there long before my attention became attracted to a man in a punt who i noticed with some surprise wore a jacket and cap exactly like mine 
he was evidently a novice at punting and his performance was most interesting 
you never knew what was going to happen when he put the pole in he evidently did not know himself 
sometimes he shot up stream and sometimes he shot down stream and at other times he simply spun round and came up the other side of the pole 
and with every result he seemed equally surprised and annoyed 
the people about the river began to get quite absorbed in him after a while and to make bets with one another as to what would be the outcome of his next push 
in the course of time my friends arrived on the opposite bank and they stopped and watched him too 
his back was towards them and they only saw his jacket and cap 
from this they immediately jumped to the conclusion that it was i their beloved companion who was making an exhibition of himself and their delight knew no bounds 
they commenced to chaff him unmercifully 
i did not grasp their mistake at first and i thought how rude of them to go on like that with a perfect stranger too  
but before i could call out and reprove them the explanation of the matter occurred to me and i withdrew behind a tree 
oh how they enjoyed themselves ridiculing that young man 
for five good minutes they stood there shouting ribaldry at him deriding him mocking him jeering at him 
they peppered him with stale jokes they even made a few new ones and threw at him 
they hurled at him all the private family jokes belonging to our set and which must have been perfectly unintelligible to him 
and then unable to stand their brutal jibes any longer he turned round on them and they saw his face 
i was glad to notice that they had sufficient decency left in them to look very foolish 
they explained to him that they had thought he was some one they knew 
they said they hoped he would not deem them capable of so insulting any one except a personal friend of their own 
 picture bathing of course their having mistaken him for a friend excused it 
i remember harris telling me once of a bathing experience he had at boulogne 
he was swimming about there near the beach when he felt himself suddenly seized by the neck from behind and forcibly plunged under water 
he struggled violently but whoever had got hold of him seemed to be a perfect hercules in strength and all his efforts to escape were unavailing 
he had given up kicking and was trying to turn his thoughts upon solemn things when his captor released him 
he regained his feet and looked round for his would be murderer 
the assassin was standing close by him laughing heartily but the moment he caught sight of harris s face as it emerged from the water he started back and seemed quite concerned 
 i really beg your pardon  he stammered confusedly but i took you for a friend of mine  
harris thought it was lucky for him the man had not mistaken him for a relation or he would probably have been drowned outright 
sailing is a thing that wants knowledge and practice too  though as a boy i did not think so 
i had an idea it came natural to a body like rounders and touch 
i knew another boy who held this view likewise and so one windy day we thought we would try the sport 
we were stopping down at yarmouth and we decided we would go for a trip up the yare 
we hired a sailing boat at the yard by the bridge and started off 
 it s rather a rough day  said the man to us as we put off better take in a reef and luff sharp when you get round the bend  
we said we would make a point of it and left him with a cheery good morning  wondering to ourselves how you luffed  and where we were to get a reef from and what we were to do with it when we had got it 
we rowed until we were out of sight of the town and then with a wide stretch of water in front of us and the wind blowing a perfect hurricane across it we felt that the time had come to commence operations 
hector  i think that was his name  went on pulling while i unrolled the sail 
it seemed a complicated job but i accomplished it at length and then came the question which was the top end 
by a sort of natural instinct we of course eventually decided that the bottom was the top and set to work to fix it upside down 
but it was a long time before we could get it up either that way or any other way 
the impression on the mind of the sail seemed to be that we were playing at funerals and that i was the corpse and itself was the winding sheet 
when it found that this was not the idea it hit me over the head with the boom and refused to do anything 
 wet it  said hector drop it over and get it wet  
he said people in ships always wetted the sails before they put them up 
so i wetted it but that only made matters worse than they were before 
a dry sail clinging to your legs and wrapping itself round your head is not pleasant but when the sail is sopping wet it becomes quite vexing 
we did get the thing up at last the two of us together 
we fixed it not exactly upside down  more sideways like  and we tied it up to the mast with the painter which we cut off for the purpose 
that the boat did not upset i simply state as a fact 
why it did not upset i am unable to offer any reason 
i have often thought about the matter since but i have never succeeded in arriving at any satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon 
possibly the result may have been brought about by the natural obstinacy of all things in this world 
the boat may possibly have come to the conclusion judging from a cursory view of our behaviour that we had come out for a morning s suicide and had thereupon determined to disappoint us 
that is the only suggestion i can offer 
by clinging like grim death to the gunwale we just managed to keep inside the boat but it was exhausting work 
hector said that pirates and other seafaring people generally lashed the rudder to something or other and hauled in the main top jib during severe squalls and thought we ought to try to do something of the kind but i was for letting her have her head to the wind 
as my advice was by far the easiest to follow we ended by adopting it and contrived to embrace the gunwale and give her her head 
the boat travelled up stream for about a mile at a pace i have never sailed at since and don t want to again 
then at a bend she heeled over till half her sail was under water 
then she righted herself by a miracle and flew for a long low bank of soft mud 
that mud bank saved us 
the boat ploughed its way into the middle of it and then stuck 
finding that we were once more able to move according to our ideas instead of being pitched and thrown about like peas in a bladder we crept forward and cut down the sail 
we had had enough sailing 
we did not want to overdo the thing and get a surfeit of it 
we had had a sail  a good all round exciting interesting sail  and now we thought we would have a row just for a change like 
we took the sculls and tried to push the boat off the mud and in doing so we broke one of the sculls 
after that we proceeded with great caution but they were a wretched old pair and the second one cracked almost easier than the first and left us helpless 
the mud stretched out for about a hundred yards in front of us and behind us was the water 
the only thing to be done was to sit and wait until someone came by 
it was not the sort of day to attract people out on the river and it was three hours before a soul came in sight 
it was an old fisherman who with immense difficulty at last rescued us and we were towed back in an ignominious fashion to the boat yard 
what between tipping the man who had brought us home and paying for the broken sculls and for having been out four hours and a half it cost us a pretty considerable number of weeks pocket money that sail 
but we learned experience and they say that is always cheap at any price 
chapter xvi 
reading   we are towed by steam launch   irritating behaviour of small boats   how they get in the way of steam launches   george and harris again shirk their work   rather a hackneyed story   streatley and goring 
we came in sight of reading about eleven 
the river is dirty and dismal here 
one does not linger in the neighbourhood of reading 
the town itself is a famous old place dating from the dim days of king ethelred when the danes anchored their warships in the kennet and started from reading to ravage all the land of wessex and here ethelred and his brother alfred fought and defeated them ethelred doing the praying and alfred the fighting 
in later years reading seems to have been regarded as a handy place to run down to when matters were becoming unpleasant in london 
parliament generally rushed off to reading whenever there was a plague on at westminster and in     the law followed suit and all the courts were held at reading 
it must have been worth while having a mere ordinary plague now and then in london to get rid of both the lawyers and the parliament 
during the parliamentary struggle reading was besieged by the earl of essex and a quarter of a century later the prince of orange routed king james s troops there 
henry i lies buried at reading in the benedictine abbey founded by him there the ruins of which may still be seen and in this same abbey great john of gaunt was married to the lady blanche 
at reading lock we came up with a steam launch belonging to some friends of mine and they towed us up to within about a mile of streatley 
it is very delightful being towed up by a launch 
i prefer it myself to rowing 
the run would have been more delightful still if it had not been for a lot of wretched small boats that were continually getting in the way of our launch and to avoid running down which we had to be continually easing and stopping 
it is really most annoying the manner in which these rowing boats get in the way of one s launch up the river something ought to done to stop it 
and they are so confoundedly impertinent too over it 
you can whistle till you nearly burst your boiler before they will trouble themselves to hurry 
i would have one or two of them run down now and then if i had my way just to teach them all a lesson 
the river becomes very lovely from a little above reading 
the railway rather spoils it near tilehurst but from mapledurham up to streatley it is glorious 
a little above mapledurham lock you pass hardwick house where charles i played bowls 
the neighbourhood of pangbourne where the quaint little swan inn stands must be as familiar to the  habitues  of the art exhibitions as it is to its own inhabitants 
my friends launch cast us loose just below the grotto and then harris wanted to make out that it was my turn to pull 
this seemed to me most unreasonable 
it had been arranged in the morning that i should bring the boat up to three miles above reading 
well here we were ten miles above reading 
surely it was now their turn again 
i could not get either george or harris to see the matter in its proper light however so to save argument i took the sculls 
i had not been pulling for more than a minute or so when george noticed something black floating on the water and we drew up to it 
george leant over as we neared it and laid hold of it 
and then he drew back with a cry and a blanched face 
it was the dead body of a woman 
it lay very lightly on the water and the face was sweet and calm 
it was not a beautiful face it was too prematurely aged looking too thin and drawn to be that but it was a gentle lovable face in spite of its stamp of pinch and poverty and upon it was that look of restful peace that comes to the faces of the sick sometimes when at last the pain has left them 
fortunately for us  we having no desire to be kept hanging about coroners courts  some men on the bank had seen the body too and now took charge of it from us 
we found out the woman s story afterwards 
of course it was the old old vulgar tragedy 
she had loved and been deceived  or had deceived herself 
anyhow she had sinned  some of us do now and then  and her family and friends naturally shocked and indignant had closed their doors against her 
left to fight the world alone with the millstone of her shame around her neck she had sunk ever lower and lower 
for a while she had kept both herself and the child on the twelve shillings a week that twelve hours drudgery a day procured her paying six shillings out of it for the child and keeping her own body and soul together on the remainder 
six shillings a week does not keep body and soul together very unitedly 
they want to get away from each other when there is only such a very slight bond as that between them and one day i suppose the pain and the dull monotony of it all had stood before her eyes plainer than usual and the mocking spectre had frightened her 
she had made one last appeal to friends but against the chill wall of their respectability the voice of the erring outcast fell unheeded and then she had gone to see her child  had held it in her arms and kissed it in a weary dull sort of way and without betraying any particular emotion of any kind and had left it after putting into its hand a penny box of chocolate she had bought it and afterwards with her last few shillings had taken a ticket and come down to goring 
 picture woman in the water  it seemed that the bitterest thoughts of her life must have centred about the wooded reaches and the bright green meadows around goring but women strangely hug the knife that stabs them and perhaps amidst the gall there may have mingled also sunny memories of sweetest hours spent upon those shadowed deeps over which the great trees bend their branches down so low 
she had wandered about the woods by the river s brink all day and then when evening fell and the grey twilight spread its dusky robe upon the waters she stretched her arms out to the silent river that had known her sorrow and her joy 
and the old river had taken her into its gentle arms and had laid her weary head upon its bosom and had hushed away the pain 
thus had she sinned in all things  sinned in living and in dying 
god help her 
and all other sinners if any more there be 
goring on the left bank and streatley on the right are both or either charming places to stay at for a few days 
the reaches down to pangbourne woo one for a sunny sail or for a moonlight row and the country round about is full of beauty 
we had intended to push on to wallingford that day but the sweet smiling face of the river here lured us to linger for a while and so we left our boat at the bridge and went up into streatley and lunched at the bull  much to montmorency s satisfaction 
they say that the hills on each ride of the stream here once joined and formed a barrier across what is now the thames and that then the river ended there above goring in one vast lake 
i am not in a position either to contradict or affirm this statement 
i simply offer it 
it is an ancient place streatley dating back like most river side towns and villages to british and saxon times 
goring is not nearly so pretty a little spot to stop at as streatley if you have your choice but it is passing fair enough in its way and is nearer the railway in case you want to slip off without paying your hotel bill 
chapter xvii 
washing day   fish and fishers   on the art of angling   a conscientious fly fisher   a fishy story 
 picture washing line we stayed two days at streatley and got our clothes washed 
we had tried washing them ourselves in the river under george s superintendence and it had been a failure 
indeed it had been more than a failure because we were worse off after we had washed our clothes than we were before 
before we had washed them they had been very very dirty it is true but they were just wearable 
after  we had washed them  well the river between reading and henley was much cleaner after we had washed our clothes in it than it was before 
all the dirt contained in the river between reading and henley we collected during that wash and worked it into our clothes 
the washerwoman at streatley said she felt she owed it to herself to charge us just three times the usual prices for that wash  she said it had not been like washing it had been more in the nature of excavating 
we paid the bill without a murmur 
the neighbourhood of streatley and goring is a great fishing centre 
there is some excellent fishing to be had here 
the river abounds in pike roach dace gudgeon and eels just here and you can sit and fish for them all day 
some people do 
they never catch them 
i never knew anybody catch anything up the thames except minnows and dead cats but that has nothing to do of course with fishing 
the local fisherman s guide doesn t say a word about catching anything 
all it says is the place is a good station for fishing  and from what i have seen of the district i am quite prepared to bear out this statement 
there is no spot in the world where you can get more fishing or where you can fish for a longer period 
some fishermen come here and fish for a day and others stop and fish for a month 
you can hang on and fish for a year if you want to it will be all the same 
the  angler s guide to the thames  says that jack and perch are also to be had about here  but there the  angler s guide  is wrong 
jack and perch may  be  about there 
indeed i know for a fact that they are 
you can  see  them there in shoals when you are out for a walk along the banks they come and stand half out of the water with their mouths open for biscuits 
and if you go for a bathe they crowd round and get in your way and irritate you 
but they are not to be had by a bit of worm on the end of a hook nor anything like it  not they 
i am not a good fisherman myself 
i devoted a considerable amount of attention to the subject at one time and was getting on as i thought fairly well but the old hands told me that i should never be any real good at it and advised me to give it up 
they said that i was an extremely neat thrower and that i seemed to have plenty of gumption for the thing and quite enough constitutional laziness 
but they were sure i should never make anything of a fisherman 
i had not got sufficient imagination 
they said that as a poet or a shilling shocker or a reporter or anything of that kind i might be satisfactory but that to gain any position as a thames angler would require more play of fancy more power of invention than i appeared to possess 
some people are under the impression that all that is required to make a good fisherman is the ability to tell lies easily and without blushing but this is a mistake 
mere bald fabrication is useless the veriest tyro can manage that 
it is in the circumstantial detail the embellishing touches of probability the general air of scrupulous  almost of pedantic  veracity that the experienced angler is seen 
anybody can come in and say oh i caught fifteen dozen perch yesterday evening  or last monday i landed a gudgeon weighing eighteen pounds and measuring three feet from the tip to the tail  
there is no art no skill required for that sort of thing 
it shows pluck but that is all 
no your accomplished angler would scorn to tell a lie that way 
his method is a study in itself 
he comes in quietly with his hat on appropriates the most comfortable chair lights his pipe and commences to puff in silence 
he lets the youngsters brag away for a while and then during a momentary lull he removes the pipe from his mouth and remarks as he knocks the ashes out against the bars  well i had a haul on tuesday evening that it s not much good my telling anybody about  
 oh 
why s that  
they ask 
 because i don t expect anybody would believe me if i did  replies the old fellow calmly and without even a tinge of bitterness in his tone as he refills his pipe and requests the landlord to bring him three of scotch cold 
there is a pause after this nobody feeling sufficiently sure of himself to contradict the old gentleman 
so he has to go on by himself without any encouragement 
 no  he continues thoughtfully i shouldn t believe it myself if anybody told it to me but it s a fact for all that 
i had been sitting there all the afternoon and had caught literally nothing  except a few dozen dace and a score of jack and i was just about giving it up as a bad job when i suddenly felt a rather smart pull at the line 
i thought it was another little one and i went to jerk it up 
hang me if i could move the rod 
it took me half an hour  half an hour sir   to land that fish and every moment i thought the line was going to snap 
i reached him at last and what do you think it was 
a sturgeon 
a forty pound sturgeon 
taken on a line sir 
yes you may well look surprised  i ll have another three of scotch landlord please  
and then he goes on to tell of the astonishment of everybody who saw it and what his wife said when he got home and of what joe buggles thought about it 
i asked the landlord of an inn up the river once if it did not injure him sometimes listening to the tales that the fishermen about there told him and he said  oh no not now sir 
it did used to knock me over a bit at first but lor love you 
me and the missus we listens to em all day now 
it s what you re used to you know 
it s what you re used to  
i knew a young man once he was a most conscientious fellow and when he took to fly fishing he determined never to exaggerate his hauls by more than twenty five per cent 
 when i have caught forty fish  said he then i will tell people that i have caught fifty and so on 
but i will not lie any more than that because it is sinful to lie  
but the twenty five per cent 
plan did not work well at all 
he never was able to use it 
the greatest number of fish he ever caught in one day was three and you can t add twenty five per cent 
to three  at least not in fish 
so he increased his percentage to thirty three and a third but that again was awkward when he had only caught one or two so to simplify matters he made up his mind to just double the quantity 
he stuck to this arrangement for a couple of months and then he grew dissatisfied with it 
nobody believed him when he told them that he only doubled and he therefore gained no credit that way whatever while his moderation put him at a disadvantage among the other anglers 
when he had really caught three small fish and said he had caught six it used to make him quite jealous to hear a man whom he knew for a fact had only caught one going about telling people he had landed two dozen 
so eventually he made one final arrangement with himself which he has religiously held to ever since and that was to count each fish that he caught as ten and to assume ten to begin with 
for example if he did not catch any fish at all then he said he had caught ten fish  you could never catch less than ten fish by his system that was the foundation of it 
then if by any chance he really did catch one fish he called it twenty while two fish would count thirty three forty and so on 
it is a simple and easily worked plan and there has been some talk lately of its being made use of by the angling fraternity in general 
indeed the committee of the thames angler s association did recommend its adoption about two years ago but some of the older members opposed it 
they said they would consider the idea if the number were doubled and each fish counted as twenty 
if ever you have an evening to spare up the river i should advise you to drop into one of the little village inns and take a seat in the tap room 
you will be nearly sure to meet one or two old rod men sipping their toddy there and they will tell you enough fishy stories in half an hour to give you indigestion for a month 
george and i  i don t know what had become of harris he had gone out and had a shave early in the afternoon and had then come back and spent full forty minutes in pipeclaying his shoes we had not seen him since  george and i therefore and the dog left to ourselves went for a walk to wallingford on the second evening and coming home we called in at a little river side inn for a rest and other things 
we went into the parlour and sat down 
there was an old fellow there smoking a long clay pipe and we naturally began chatting 
he told us that it had been a fine day to day and we told him that it had been a fine day yesterday and then we all told each other that we thought it would be a fine day to morrow and george said the crops seemed to be coming up nicely 
after that it came out somehow or other that we were strangers in the neighbourhood and that we were going away the next morning 
 picture the trout then a pause ensued in the conversation during which our eyes wandered round the room 
they finally rested upon a dusty old glass case fixed very high up above the chimney piece and containing a trout 
it rather fascinated me that trout it was such a monstrous fish 
in fact at first glance i thought it was a cod 
 ah  
said the old gentleman following the direction of my gaze fine fellow that ain t he  
 quite uncommon  i murmured and george asked the old man how much he thought it weighed 
 eighteen pounds six ounces  said our friend rising and taking down his coat 
 yes  he continued it wur sixteen year ago come the third o next month that i landed him 
i caught him just below the bridge with a minnow 
they told me he wur in the river and i said i d have him and so i did 
you don t see many fish that size about here now i m thinking 
good night gentlemen good night  
and out he went and left us alone 
we could not take our eyes off the fish after that 
it really was a remarkably fine fish 
we were still looking at it when the local carrier who had just stopped at the inn came to the door of the room with a pot of beer in his hand and he also looked at the fish 
 good sized trout that  said george turning round to him 
 ah 
you may well say that sir  replied the man and then after a pull at his beer he added maybe you wasn t here sir when that fish was caught  
 no  we told him 
we were strangers in the neighbourhood 
 ah  
said the carrier then of course how should you 
it was nearly five years ago that i caught that trout  
 oh 
was it you who caught it then  
said i 
 yes sir  replied the genial old fellow 
 i caught him just below the lock  leastways what was the lock then  one friday afternoon and the remarkable thing about it is that i caught him with a fly 
i d gone out pike fishing bless you never thinking of a trout and when i saw that whopper on the end of my line blest if it didn t quite take me aback 
well you see he weighed twenty six pound 
good night gentlemen good night  
five minutes afterwards a third man came in and described how  he  had caught it early one morning with bleak and then he left and a stolid solemn looking middle aged individual came in and sat down over by the window 
none of us spoke for a while but at length george turned to the new comer and said  i beg your pardon i hope you will forgive the liberty that we  perfect strangers in the neighbourhood  are taking but my friend here and myself would be so much obliged if you would tell us how you caught that trout up there  
 why who told you i caught that trout  
was the surprised query 
we said that nobody had told us so but somehow or other we felt instinctively that it was he who had done it 
 well it s a most remarkable thing  most remarkable  answered the stolid stranger laughing because as a matter of fact you are quite right 
i did catch it 
but fancy your guessing it like that 
dear me it s really a most remarkable thing  
and then he went on and told us how it had taken him half an hour to land it and how it had broken his rod 
he said he had weighed it carefully when he reached home and it had turned the scale at thirty four pounds 
he went in his turn and when he was gone the landlord came in to us 
we told him the various histories we had heard about his trout and he was immensely amused and we all laughed very heartily 
 fancy jim bates and joe muggles and mr jones and old billy maunders all telling you that they had caught it 
ha 
ha 
ha 
well that is good  said the honest old fellow laughing heartily 
 yes they are the sort to give it  me  to put up in  my  parlour if  they  had caught it they are 
ha 
ha 
ha  
and then he told us the real history of the fish 
it seemed that he had caught it himself years ago when he was quite a lad not by any art or skill but by that unaccountable luck that appears to always wait upon a boy when he plays the wag from school and goes out fishing on a sunny afternoon with a bit of string tied on to the end of a tree 
he said that bringing home that trout had saved him from a whacking and that even his school master had said it was worth the rule of three and practice put together 
he was called out of the room at this point and george and i again turned our gaze upon the fish 
it really was a most astonishing trout 
the more we looked at it the more we marvelled at it 
it excited george so much that he climbed up on the back of a chair to get a better view of it 
and then the chair slipped and george clutched wildly at the trout case to save himself and down it came with a crash george and the chair on top of it 
 you haven t injured the fish have you  
i cried in alarm rushing up 
 i hope not  said george rising cautiously and looking about 
but he had 
that trout lay shattered into a thousand fragments  i say a thousand but they may have only been nine hundred 
i did not count them 
we thought it strange and unaccountable that a stuffed trout should break up into little pieces like that 
and so it would have been strange and unaccountable if it had been a stuffed trout but it was not 
that trout was plaster of paris 
chapter xviii 
locks   george and i are photographed   wallingford   dorchester   abingdon   a family man   a good spot for drowning   a difficult bit of water   demoralizing effect of river air 
we left streatley early the next morning and pulled up to culham and slept under the canvas in the backwater there 
the river is not extraordinarily interesting between streatley and wallingford 
from cleve you get a stretch of six and a half miles without a lock 
i believe this is the longest uninterrupted stretch anywhere above teddington and the oxford club make use of it for their trial eights 
but however satisfactory this absence of locks may be to rowing men it is to be regretted by the mere pleasure seeker 
for myself i am fond of locks 
they pleasantly break the monotony of the pull 
i like sitting in the boat and slowly rising out of the cool depths up into new reaches and fresh views or sinking down as it were out of the world and then waiting while the gloomy gates creak and the narrow strip of day light between them widens till the fair smiling river lies full before you and you push your little boat out from its brief prison on to the welcoming waters once again 
they are picturesque little spots these locks 
the stout old lock keeper or his cheerful looking wife or bright eyed daughter are pleasant folk to have a passing chat with 
      you meet other boats there and river gossip is exchanged 
the thames would not be the fairyland it is without its flower decked locks 
talking of locks reminds me of an accident george and i very nearly had one summer s morning at hampton court 
it was a glorious day and the lock was crowded and as is a common practice up the river a speculative photographer was taking a picture of us all as we lay upon the rising waters 
i did not catch what was going on at first and was therefore extremely surprised at noticing george hurriedly smooth out his trousers ruffle up his hair and stick his cap on in a rakish manner at the back of his head and then assuming an expression of mingled affability and sadness sit down in a graceful attitude and try to hide his feet 
my first idea was that he had suddenly caught sight of some girl he knew and i looked about to see who it was 
everybody in the lock seemed to have been suddenly struck wooden 
they were all standing or sitting about in the most quaint and curious attitudes i have ever seen off a japanese fan 
all the girls were smiling 
oh they did look so sweet 
and all the fellows were frowning and looking stern and noble 
and then at last the truth flashed across me and i wondered if i should be in time 
ours was the first boat and it would be unkind of me to spoil the man s picture i thought 
so i faced round quickly and took up a position in the prow where i leant with careless grace upon the hitcher in an attitude suggestive of agility and strength 
i arranged my hair with a curl over the forehead and threw an air of tender wistfulness into my expression mingled with a touch of cynicism which i am told suits me 
as we stood waiting for the eventful moment i heard someone behind call out  hi 
look at your nose  
i could not turn round to see what was the matter and whose nose it was that was to be looked at 
i stole a side glance at george s nose 
it was all right  at all events there was nothing wrong with it that could be altered 
i squinted down at my own and that seemed all that could be expected also 
 look at your nose you stupid ass  
came the same voice again louder 
and then another voice cried  push your nose out can t you you  you two with the dog  
neither george nor i dared to turn round 
the man s hand was on the cap and the picture might be taken any moment 
was it us they were calling to 
what was the matter with our noses 
why were they to be pushed out 
but now the whole lock started yelling and a stentorian voice from the back shouted  look at your boat sir you in the red and black caps 
it s your two corpses that will get taken in that photo if you ain t quick  
we looked then and saw that the nose of our boat had got fixed under the woodwork of the lock while the in coming water was rising all around it and tilting it up 
in another moment we should be over 
quick as thought we each seized an oar and a vigorous blow against the side of the lock with the butt ends released the boat and sent us sprawling on our backs 
 picture the photograph we did not come out well in that photograph george and i 
of course as was to be expected our luck ordained it that the man should set his wretched machine in motion at the precise moment that we were both lying on our backs with a wild expression of where am i 
and what is it  
on our faces and our four feet waving madly in the air 
our feet were undoubtedly the leading article in that photograph 
indeed very little else was to be seen 
they filled up the foreground entirely 
behind them you caught glimpses of the other boats and bits of the surrounding scenery but everything and everybody else in the lock looked so utterly insignificant and paltry compared with our feet that all the other people felt quite ashamed of themselves and refused to subscribe to the picture 
the owner of one steam launch who had bespoke six copies rescinded the order on seeing the negative 
he said he would take them if anybody could show him his launch but nobody could 
it was somewhere behind george s right foot 
there was a good deal of unpleasantness over the business 
the photographer thought we ought to take a dozen copies each seeing that the photo was about nine tenths us but we declined 
we said we had no objection to being photo d full length but we preferred being taken the right way up 
wallingford six miles above streatley is a very ancient town and has been an active centre for the making of english history 
it was a rude mud built town in the time of the britons who squatted there until the roman legions evicted them and replaced their clay baked walls by mighty fortifications the trace of which time has not yet succeeded in sweeping away so well those old world masons knew how to build 
but time though he halted at roman walls soon crumbled romans to dust and on the ground in later years fought savage saxons and huge danes until the normans came 
it was a walled and fortified town up to the time of the parliamentary war when it suffered a long and bitter siege from fairfax 
it fell at last and then the walls were razed 
from wallingford up to dorchester the neighbourhood of the river grows more hilly varied and picturesque 
dorchester stands half a mile from the river 
it can be reached by paddling up the thame if you have a small boat but the best way is to leave the river at day s lock and take a walk across the fields 
dorchester is a delightfully peaceful old place nestling in stillness and silence and drowsiness 
dorchester like wallingford was a city in ancient british times it was then called caer doren the city on the water  
in more recent times the romans formed a great camp here the fortifications surrounding which now seem like low even hills 
in saxon days it was the capital of wessex 
it is very old and it was very strong and great once 
now it sits aside from the stirring world and nods and dreams 
round clifton hampden itself a wonderfully pretty village old fashioned peaceful and dainty with flowers the river scenery is rich and beautiful 
if you stay the night on land at clifton you cannot do better than put up at the barley mow  
it is without exception i should say the quaintest most old world inn up the river 
it stands on the right of the bridge quite away from the village 
its low pitched gables and thatched roof and latticed windows give it quite a story book appearance while inside it is even still more once upon a timeyfied 
it would not be a good place for the heroine of a modern novel to stay at 
the heroine of a modern novel is always divinely tall  and she is ever drawing herself up to her full height  
at the barley mow she would bump her head against the ceiling each time she did this 
it would also be a bad house for a drunken man to put up at 
there are too many surprises in the way of unexpected steps down into this room and up into that and as for getting upstairs to his bedroom or ever finding his bed when he got up either operation would be an utter impossibility to him 
we were up early the next morning as we wanted to be in oxford by the afternoon 
it is surprising how early one  can  get up when camping out 
one does not yearn for just another five minutes nearly so much lying wrapped up in a rug on the boards of a boat with a gladstone bag for a pillow as one does in a featherbed 
we had finished breakfast and were through clifton lock by half past eight 
from clifton to culham the river banks are flat monotonous and uninteresting but after you get through culhalm lock  the coldest and deepest lock on the river  the landscape improves 
at abingdon the river passes by the streets 
abingdon is a typical country town of the smaller order  quiet eminently respectable clean and desperately dull 
it prides itself on being old but whether it can compare in this respect with wallingford and dorchester seems doubtful 
a famous abbey stood here once and within what is left of its sanctified walls they brew bitter ale nowadays 
in st nicholas church at abingdon there is a monument to john blackwall and his wife jane who both after leading a happy married life died on the very same day august       and in st helen s church it is recorded that w lee who died in     had in his lifetime issue from his loins two hundred lacking but three  
if you work this out you will find that mr w lee s family numbered one hundred and ninety seven 
mr w lee  five times mayor of abingdon  was no doubt a benefactor to his generation but i hope there are not many of his kind about in this overcrowded nineteenth century 
from abingdon to nuneham courteney is a lovely stretch 
nuneham park is well worth a visit 
it can be viewed on tuesdays and thursdays 
the house contains a fine collection of pictures and curiosities and the grounds are very beautiful 
the pool under sandford lasher just behind the lock is a very good place to drown yourself in 
the undercurrent is terribly strong and if you once get down into it you are all right 
an obelisk marks the spot where two men have already been drowned while bathing there and the steps of the obelisk are generally used as a diving board by young men now who wish to see if the place really  is  dangerous 
 picture river scene  iffley lock and mill a mile before you reach oxford is a favourite subject with the river loving brethren of the brush 
the real article however is rather disappointing after the pictures 
few things i have noticed come quite up to the pictures of them in this world 
we passed through iffley lock at about half past twelve and then having tidied up the boat and made all ready for landing we set to work on our last mile 
between iffley and oxford is the most difficult bit of the river i know 
you want to be born on that bit of water to understand it 
i have been over it a fairish number of times but i have never been able to get the hang of it 
the man who could row a straight course from oxford to iffley ought to be able to live comfortably under one roof with his wife his mother in law his elder sister and the old servant who was in the family when he was a baby 
first the current drives you on to the right bank and then on to the left then it takes you out into the middle turns you round three times and carries you up stream again and always ends by trying to smash you up against a college barge 
of course as a consequence of this we got in the way of a good many other boats during the mile and they in ours and of course as a consequence of that a good deal of bad language occurred 
i don t know why it should be but everybody is always so exceptionally irritable on the river 
little mishaps that you would hardly notice on dry land drive you nearly frantic with rage when they occur on the water 
when harris or george makes an ass of himself on dry land i smile indulgently when they behave in a chuckle head way on the river i use the most blood curdling language to them 
when another boat gets in my way i feel i want to take an oar and kill all the people in it 
the mildest tempered people when on land become violent and blood thirsty when in a boat 
i did a little boating once with a young lady 
she was naturally of the sweetest and gentlest disposition imaginable but on the river it was quite awful to hear her 
 oh drat the man  
she would exclaim when some unfortunate sculler would get in her way why don t he look where he s going  
and oh bother the silly old thing  
she would say indignantly when the sail would not go up properly 
and she would catch hold of it and shake it quite brutally 
yet as i have said when on shore she was kind hearted and amiable enough 
 picture man at the lock picture man at the lock the air of the river has a demoralising effect upon one s temper and this it is i suppose which causes even barge men to be sometimes rude to one another and to use language which no doubt in their calmer moments they regret 
chapter xix 
oxford   montmorency s idea of heaven   the hired up river boat its beauties and advantages   the pride of the thames  
  the weather changes   the river under different aspects   not a cheerful evening   yearnings for the unattainable   the cheery chat goes round   george performs upon the banjo   a mournful melody   another wet day   flight   a little supper and a toast 
 picture dog running we spent two very pleasant days at oxford 
there are plenty of dogs in the town of oxford 
montmorency had eleven fights on the first day and fourteen on the second and evidently thought he had got to heaven 
 picture dogs fighting among folk too constitutionally weak or too constitutionally lazy whichever it may be to relish up stream work it is a common practice to get a boat at oxford and row down 
for the energetic however the up stream journey is certainly to be preferred 
it does not seem good to be always going with the current 
there is more satisfaction in squaring one s back and fighting against it and winning one s way forward in spite of it  at least so i feel when harris and george are sculling and i am steering 
 picture dog running to those who do contemplate making oxford their starting place i would say take your own boat  unless of course you can take someone else s without any possible danger of being found out 
the boats that as a rule are let for hire on the thames above marlow are very good boats 
they are fairly water tight and so long as they are handled with care they rarely come to pieces or sink 
there are places in them to sit down on and they are complete with all the necessary arrangements  or nearly all  to enable you to row them and steer them 
but they are not ornamental 
the boat you hire up the river above marlow is not the sort of boat in which you can flash about and give yourself airs 
the hired up river boat very soon puts a stop to any nonsense of that sort on the part of its occupants 
that is its chief  one may say its only recommendation 
 picture dog the man in the hired up river boat is modest and retiring 
he likes to keep on the shady side underneath the trees and to do most of his travelling early in the morning or late at night when there are not many people about on the river to look at him 
when the man in the hired up river boat sees anyone he knows he gets out on to the bank and hides behind a tree 
i was one of a party who hired an up river boat one summer for a few days trip 
we had none of us ever seen the hired up river boat before and we did not know what it was when we did see it 
we had written for a boat  a double sculling skiff and when we went down with our bags to the yard and gave our names the man said  picture the pride of the thames oh yes you re the party that wrote for a double sculling skiff 
it s all right 
jim fetch round  the pride of the thames  
the boy went and re appeared five minutes afterwards struggling with an antediluvian chunk of wood that looked as though it had been recently dug out of somewhere and dug out carelessly so as to have been unnecessarily damaged in the process 
my own idea on first catching sight of the object was that it was a roman relic of some sort   relic of  what  i do not know possibly of a coffin 
the neighbourhood of the upper thames is rich in roman relics and my surmise seemed to me a very probable one but our serious young man who is a bit of a geologist pooh poohed my roman relic theory and said it was clear to the meanest intellect in which category he seemed to be grieved that he could not conscientiously include mine that the thing the boy had found was the fossil of a whale and he pointed out to us various evidences proving that it must have belonged to the preglacial period 
to settle the dispute we appealed to the boy 
we told him not to be afraid but to speak the plain truth was it the fossil of a pre adamite whale or was it an early roman coffin 
the boy said it was  the pride of the thames 
we thought this a very humorous answer on the part of the boy at first and somebody gave him twopence as a reward for his ready wit but when he persisted in keeping up the joke as we thought too long we got vexed with him 
 come come my lad  
said our captain sharply don t let us have any nonsense 
you take your mother s washing tub home again and bring us a boat  
the boat builder himself came up then and assured us on his word as a practical man that the thing really was a boat  was in fact  the  boat the double sculling skiff selected to take us on our trip down the river 
we grumbled a good deal 
we thought he might at least have had it whitewashed or tarred  had  something  done to it to distinguish it from a bit of a wreck but he could not see any fault in it 
he even seemed offended at our remarks 
he said he had picked us out the best boat in all his stock and he thought we might have been more grateful 
he said it  the pride of the thames  had been in use just as it now stood or rather as it now hung together  for the last forty years to his  knowledge and nobody had complained of it before and he did not see why we should be the first to begin 
we argued no more 
we fastened the so called boat together with some pieces of string got a bit of wall paper and pasted over the shabbier places said our prayers and stepped on board 
they charged us thirty five shillings for the loan of the remnant for six days and we could have bought the thing out and out for four and sixpence at any sale of drift wood round the coast 
the weather changed on the third day   oh 
i am talking about our present trip now   and we started from oxford upon our homeward journey in the midst of a steady drizzle 
the river  with the sunlight flashing from its dancing wavelets gilding gold the grey green beech trunks glinting through the dark cool wood paths chasing shadows o er the shallows flinging diamonds from the mill wheels throwing kisses to the lilies wantoning with the weirs white waters silvering moss grown walls and bridges brightening every tiny townlet making sweet each lane and meadow lying tangled in the rushes peeping laughing from each inlet gleaming gay on many a far sail making soft the air with glory  is a golden fairy stream 
but the river  chill and weary with the ceaseless rain drops falling on its brown and sluggish waters with a sound as of a woman weeping low in some dark chamber while the woods all dark and silent shrouded in their mists of vapour stand like ghosts upon the margin silent ghosts with eyes reproachful like the ghosts of evil actions like the ghosts of friends neglected  is a spirit haunted water through the land of vain regrets 
sunlight is the life blood of nature 
mother earth looks at us with such dull soulless eyes when the sunlight has died away from out of her 
it makes us sad to be with her then she does not seem to know us or to care for us 
she is as a widow who has lost the husband she loved and her children touch her hand and look up into her eyes but gain no smile from her 
we rowed on all that day through the rain and very melancholy work it was 
we pretended at first that we enjoyed it 
we said it was a change and that we liked to see the river under all its different aspects 
we said we could not expect to have it all sunshine nor should we wish it 
we told each other that nature was beautiful even in her tears 
 picture the boat in the rain  indeed harris and i were quite enthusiastic about the business for the first few hours 
and we sang a song about a gipsy s life and how delightful a gipsy s existence was   free to storm and sunshine and to every wind that blew   and how he enjoyed the rain and what a lot of good it did him and how he laughed at people who didn t like it 
george took the fun more soberly and stuck to the umbrella 
we hoisted the cover before we had lunch and kept it up all the afternoon just leaving a little space in the bow from which one of us could paddle and keep a look out 
in this way we made nine miles and pulled up for the night a little below day s lock 
i cannot honestly say that we had a merry evening 
the rain poured down with quiet persistency 
everything in the boat was damp and clammy 
supper was not a success 
cold veal pie when you don t feel hungry is apt to cloy 
i felt i wanted whitebait and a cutlet harris babbled of soles and white sauce and passed the remains of his pie to montmorency who declined it and apparently insulted by the offer went and sat over at the other end of the boat by himself 
george requested that we would not talk about these things at all events until he had finished his cold boiled beef without mustard 
we played penny nap after supper 
we played for about an hour and a half by the end of which time george had won fourpence  george always is lucky at cards  and harris and i had lost exactly twopence each 
we thought we would give up gambling then 
as harris said it breeds an unhealthy excitement when carried too far 
george offered to go on and give us our revenge but harris and i decided not to battle any further against fate 
after that we mixed ourselves some toddy and sat round and talked 
george told us about a man he had known who had come up the river two years ago and who had slept out in a damp boat on just such another night as that was and it had given him rheumatic fever and nothing was able to save him and he had died in great agony ten days afterwards 
george said he was quite a young man and was engaged to be married 
he said it was one of the saddest things he had ever known 
and that put harris in mind of a friend of his who had been in the volunteers and who had slept out under canvas one wet night down at aldershot on just such another night as this  said harris and he had woke up in the morning a cripple for life 
harris said he would introduce us both to the man when we got back to town it would make our hearts bleed to see him 
this naturally led to some pleasant chat about sciatica fevers chills lung diseases and bronchitis and harris said how very awkward it would be if one of us were taken seriously ill in the night seeing how far away we were from a doctor 
there seemed to be a desire for something frolicksome to follow upon this conversation and in a weak moment i suggested that george should get out his banjo and see if he could not give us a comic song 
i will say for george that he did not want any pressing 
there was no nonsense about having left his music at home or anything of that sort 
he at once fished out his instrument and commenced to play two lovely black eyes  
i had always regarded two lovely black eyes as rather a commonplace tune until that evening 
the rich vein of sadness that george extracted from it quite surprised me 
the desire that grew upon harris and myself as the mournful strains progressed was to fall upon each other s necks and weep but by great effort we kept back the rising tears and listened to the wild yearnful melody in silence 
when the chorus came we even made a desperate effort to be merry 
we re filled our glasses and joined in harris in a voice trembling with emotion leading and george and i following a few words behind  two lovely black eyes oh 
what a surprise 
only for telling a man he was wrong two    there we broke down 
the unutterable pathos of george s accompaniment to that two we were in our then state of depression unable to bear 
harris sobbed like a little child and the dog howled till i thought his heart or his jaw must surely break 
george wanted to go on with another verse 
he thought that when he had got a little more into the tune and could throw more abandon  as it were into the rendering it might not seem so sad 
the feeling of the majority however was opposed to the experiment 
there being nothing else to do we went to bed  that is we undressed ourselves and tossed about at the bottom of the boat for some three or four hours 
after which we managed to get some fitful slumber until five a m  when we all got up and had breakfast 
the second day was exactly like the first 
the rain continued to pour down and we sat wrapped up in our mackintoshes underneath the canvas and drifted slowly down 
one of us  i forget which one now but i rather think it was myself  made a few feeble attempts during the course of the morning to work up the old gipsy foolishness about being children of nature and enjoying the wet but it did not go down well at all 
that   i care not for the rain not i  
was so painfully evident as expressing the sentiments of each of us that to sing it seemed unnecessary 
on one point we were all agreed and that was that come what might we would go through with this job to the bitter end 
we had come out for a fortnight s enjoyment on the river and a fortnight s enjoyment on the river we meant to have 
if it killed us 
well that would be a sad thing for our friends and relations but it could not be helped 
we felt that to give in to the weather in a climate such as ours would be a most disastrous precedent 
 it s only two days more  said harris and we are young and strong 
we may get over it all right after all  
at about four o clock we began to discuss our arrangements for the evening 
we were a little past goring then and we decided to paddle on to pangbourne and put up there for the night 
 another jolly evening  
murmured george 
we sat and mused on the prospect 
we should be in at pangbourne by five 
we should finish dinner at say half past six 
after that we could walk about the village in the pouring rain until bed time or we could sit in a dimly lit bar parlour and read the almanac 
 picture lady in skirt why the alhambra would be almost more lively  said harris venturing his head outside the cover for a moment and taking a survey of the sky 
 with a little supper at the       to follow  i added half unconsciously 
 yes it s almost a pity we ve made up our minds to stick to this boat  answered harris and then there was silence for a while 
 if we  hadn t  made up our minds to contract our certain deaths in this bally old coffin  observed george casting a glance of intense malevolence over the boat it might be worth while to mention that there s a train leaves pangbourne i know soon after five which would just land us in town in comfortable time to get a chop and then go on to the place you mentioned afterwards  
nobody spoke 
we looked at one another and each one seemed to see his own mean and guilty thoughts reflected in the faces of the others 
in silence we dragged out and overhauled the gladstone 
we looked up the river and down the river not a soul was in sight 
twenty minutes later three figures followed by a shamed looking dog might have been seen creeping stealthily from the boat house at the swan towards the railway station dressed in the following neither neat nor gaudy costume  black leather shoes dirty suit of boating flannels very dirty brown felt hat much battered mackintosh very wet umbrella 
we had deceived the boatman at pangbourne 
we had not had the face to tell him that we were running away from the rain 
we had left the boat and all it contained in his charge with instructions that it was to be ready for us at nine the next morning 
if we said  if  anything unforeseen should happen preventing our return we would write to him 
we reached paddington at seven and drove direct to the restaurant i have before described where we partook of a light meal left montmorency together with suggestions for a supper to be ready at half past ten and then continued our way to leicester square 
we attracted a good deal of attention at the alhambra 
on our presenting ourselves at the paybox we were gruffly directed to go round to castle street and were informed that we were half an hour behind our time 
we convinced the man with some difficulty that we were  not  the world renowned contortionists from the himalaya mountains  and he took our money and let us pass 
inside we were a still greater success 
our fine bronzed countenances and picturesque clothes were followed round the place with admiring gaze 
we were the cynosure of every eye 
it was a proud moment for us all 
we adjourned soon after the first ballet and wended our way back to the restaurant where supper was already awaiting us 
i must confess to enjoying that supper 
for about ten days we seemed to have been living more or less on nothing but cold meat cake and bread and jam 
it had been a simple a nutritious diet but there had been nothing exciting about it and the odour of burgundy and the smell of french sauces and the sight of clean napkins and long loaves knocked as a very welcome visitor at the door of our inner man 
we pegged and quaffed away in silence for a while until the time came when instead of sitting bolt upright and grasping the knife and fork firmly we leant back in our chairs and worked slowly and carelessly  when we stretched out our legs beneath the table let our napkins fall unheeded to the floor and found time to more critically examine the smoky ceiling than we had hitherto been able to do  when we rested our glasses at arm s length upon the table and felt good and thoughtful and forgiving 
then harris who was sitting next the window drew aside the curtain and looked out upon the street 
it glistened darkly in the wet the dim lamps flickered with each gust the rain splashed steadily into the puddles and trickled down the water spouts into the running gutters 
a few soaked wayfarers hurried past crouching beneath their dripping umbrellas the women holding up their skirts 
 well  said harris reaching his hand out for his glass we have had a pleasant trip and my hearty thanks for it to old father thames  but i think we did well to chuck it when we did 
here s to three men well out of a boat  
and montmorency standing on his hind legs before the window peering out into the night gave a short bark of decided concurrence with the toast

the conservancy of late seems to have constituted itself into a society for the employment of idiots 
a good many of the new lock keepers especially in the more crowded portions of the river are excitable nervous old men quite unfitted for their post 
      a capital little out of the way restaurant in the neighbourhood of    where you can get one of the best cooked and cheapest little french dinners or suppers that i know of with an excellent bottle of beaune for three and six and which i am not going to be idiot enough to advertise
