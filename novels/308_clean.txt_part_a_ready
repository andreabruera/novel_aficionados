the chief beauty of this book lies not so much in its literary style  or in the extent and usefulness of the information it conveys   as in its simple truthfulness 
its pages form the record of events that really happened 
all that has been done is to colour them   and  for this   no extra charge has been made 
george and harris and montmorency are not poetic ideals   but things of flesh and blood  especially george   who weighs about twelve stone 
other works may excel this in depth of thought and knowledge of human nature other books may rival it in originality and size   but   for hopeless and incurable veracity   nothing yet discovered can surpass it 
this  more than all its other charms   will   it is felt   make the volume precious in the eye of the earnest reader   and will lend additional weight to the lesson that the story teaches

 picture graphic of three men in a rowing boat     chapter i 
three invalids   sufferings of george and harris   a victim to one hundred and seven fatal maladies   useful prescriptions   cure for liver complaint in children   we agree that we are overworked and need rest   a week on the rolling deep   george suggests the river   montmorency lodges an objection   original motion carried by majority of three to one 
there were four of us  george and william samuel harris and myself and montmorency 
we were sitting in my room smoking and talking about how bad we were  bad from a medical point of view i mean of course 
we were all feeling seedy and we were getting quite nervous about it 
harris said he felt such extraordinary fits of giddiness come over him at times that he hardly knew what he was doing and then george said that he  had fits of giddiness too and hardly knew what  he  was doing 
with me it was my liver that was out of order 
i knew it was my liver that was out of order because i had just been reading a patent liver pill circular in which were detailed the various symptoms by which a man could tell when his liver was out of order 
i had them all 
it is a most extraordinary thing but i never read a patent medicine advertisement without being impelled to the conclusion that i am suffering from the particular disease therein dealt with in its most virulent form 
the diagnosis seems in every case to correspond exactly with all the sensations that i have ever felt 
 picture man reading book i remember going to the british museum one day to read up the treatment for some slight ailment of which i had a touch  hay fever i fancy it was 
i got down the book and read all i came to read and then in an unthinking moment i idly turned the leaves and began to indolently study diseases generally 
i forget which was the first distemper i plunged into  some fearful devastating scourge i know  and before i had glanced half down the list of premonitory symptoms  it was borne in upon me that i had fairly got it 
i sat for awhile frozen with horror and then in the listlessness of despair i again turned over the pages 
i came to typhoid fever  read the symptoms  discovered that i had typhoid fever must have had it for months without knowing it  wondered what else i had got turned up st vitus s dance  found as i expected that i had that too   began to get interested in my case and determined to sift it to the bottom and so started alphabetically  read up ague and learnt that i was sickening for it and that the acute stage would commence in about another fortnight 
bright s disease i was relieved to find i had only in a modified form and so far as that was concerned i might live for years 
cholera i had with severe complications and diphtheria i seemed to have been born with 
i plodded conscientiously through the twenty six letters and the only malady i could conclude i had not got was housemaid s knee 
i felt rather hurt about this at first it seemed somehow to be a sort of slight 
why hadn t i got housemaid s knee 
why this invidious reservation 
after a while however less grasping feelings prevailed 
i reflected that i had every other known malady in the pharmacology and i grew less selfish and determined to do without housemaid s knee 
gout in its most malignant stage it would appear had seized me without my being aware of it and zymosis i had evidently been suffering with from boyhood 
there were no more diseases after zymosis so i concluded there was nothing else the matter with me 
i sat and pondered 
i thought what an interesting case i must be from a medical point of view what an acquisition i should be to a class 
students would have no need to walk the hospitals  if they had me 
i was a hospital in myself 
all they need do would be to walk round me and after that take their diploma 
then i wondered how long i had to live 
i tried to examine myself 
i felt my pulse 
i could not at first feel any pulse at all 
then all of a sudden it seemed to start off 
i pulled out my watch and timed it 
i made it a hundred and forty seven to the minute 
i tried to feel my heart 
i could not feel my heart 
it had stopped beating 
i have since been induced to come to the opinion that it must have been there all the time and must have been beating but i cannot account for it 
i patted myself all over my front from what i call my waist up to my head and i went a bit round each side and a little way up the back 
but i could not feel or hear anything 
i tried to look at my tongue 
i stuck it out as far as ever it would go and i shut one eye and tried to examine it with the other 
i could only see the tip and the only thing that i could gain from that was to feel more certain than before that i had scarlet fever 
 picture man with walking stick i had walked into that reading room a happy healthy man 
i crawled out a decrepit wreck 
i went to my medical man 
he is an old chum of mine and feels my pulse and looks at my tongue and talks about the weather all for nothing when i fancy i m ill so i thought i would do him a good turn by going to him now 
 what a doctor wants  i said is practice 
he shall have me 
he will get more practice out of me than out of seventeen hundred of your ordinary commonplace patients with only one or two diseases each  
so i went straight up and saw him and he said  well what s the matter with you  
i said  i will not take up your time dear boy with telling you what is the matter with me 
life is brief and you might pass away before i had finished 
but i will tell you what is  not  the matter with me 
i have not got housemaid s knee 
why i have not got housemaid s knee i cannot tell you but the fact remains that i have not got it 
everything else however i  have  got  
and i told him how i came to discover it all 
then he opened me and looked down me and clutched hold of my wrist and then he hit me over the chest when i wasn t expecting it  a cowardly thing to do i call it  and immediately afterwards butted me with the side of his head 
after that he sat down and wrote out a prescription and folded it up and gave it me and i put it in my pocket and went out 
i did not open it 
i took it to the nearest chemist s and handed it in 
the man read it and then handed it back 
he said he didn t keep it 
i said  you are a chemist  
he said  i am a chemist 
if i was a co operative stores and family hotel combined i might be able to oblige you 
being only a chemist hampers me  
i read the prescription 
it ran   lb 
beefsteak with  pt 
bitter beer  every  hours 
 ten mile walk every morning 
 bed at  sharp every night 
and don t stuff up your head with things you don t understand  
i followed the directions with the happy result  speaking for myself  that my life was preserved and is still going on 
in the present instance going back to the liver pill circular i had the symptoms beyond all mistake the chief among them being a general disinclination to work of any kind  
what i suffer in that way no tongue can tell 
from my earliest infancy i have been a martyr to it 
as a boy the disease hardly ever left me for a day 
they did not know then that it was my liver 
medical science was in a far less advanced state than now and they used to put it down to laziness 
 why you skulking little devil you  they would say get up and do something for your living can t you  
  not knowing of course that i was ill  and they didn t give me pills they gave me clumps on the side of the head 
and strange as it may appear those clumps on the head often cured me  for the time being 
i have known one clump on the head have more effect upon my liver and make me feel more anxious to go straight away then and there and do what was wanted to be done without further loss of time than a whole box of pills does now 
you know it often is so  those simple old fashioned remedies are sometimes more efficacious than all the dispensary stuff 
we sat there for half an hour describing to each other our maladies 
i explained to george and william harris how i felt when i got up in the morning and william harris told us how he felt when he went to bed and george stood on the hearth rug and gave us a clever and powerful piece of acting illustrative of how he felt in the night 
george  fancies  he is ill but there s never anything really the matter with him you know 
at this point mrs poppets knocked at the door to know if we were ready for supper 
we smiled sadly at one another and said we supposed we had better try to swallow a bit 
harris said a little something in one s stomach often kept the disease in check and mrs poppets brought the tray in and we drew up to the table and toyed with a little steak and onions and some rhubarb tart 
i must have been very weak at the time because i know after the first half hour or so i seemed to take no interest whatever in my food  an unusual thing for me  and i didn t want any cheese 
this duty done we refilled our glasses lit our pipes and resumed the discussion upon our state of health 
what it was that was actually the matter with us we none of us could be sure of but the unanimous opinion was that it  whatever it was  had been brought on by overwork 
 what we want is rest  said harris 
 rest and a complete change  said george 
 the overstrain upon our brains has produced a general depression throughout the system 
change of scene and absence of the necessity for thought will restore the mental equilibrium  
george has a cousin who is usually described in the charge sheet as a medical student so that he naturally has a somewhat family physicianary way of putting things 
i agreed with george and suggested that we should seek out some retired and old world spot far from the madding crowd and dream away a sunny week among its drowsy lanes  some half forgotten nook hidden away by the fairies out of reach of the noisy world  some quaint perched eyrie on the cliffs of time from whence the surging waves of the nineteenth century would sound far off and faint 
harris said he thought it would be humpy 
he said he knew the sort of place i meant where everybody went to bed at eight o clock and you couldn t get a  referee  for love or money and had to walk ten miles to get your baccy 
 no  said harris if you want rest and change you can t beat a sea trip  
i objected to the sea trip strongly 
a sea trip does you good when you are going to have a couple of months of it but for a week it is wicked 
you start on monday with the idea implanted in your bosom that you are going to enjoy yourself 
you wave an airy adieu to the boys on shore light your biggest pipe and swagger about the deck as if you were captain cook sir francis drake and christopher columbus all rolled into one 
on tuesday you wish you hadn t come 
on wednesday thursday and friday you wish you were dead 
on saturday you are able to swallow a little beef tea and to sit up on deck and answer with a wan sweet smile when kind hearted people ask you how you feel now 
on sunday you begin to walk about again and take solid food 
and on monday morning as with your bag and umbrella in your hand you stand by the gunwale waiting to step ashore you begin to thoroughly like it 
i remember my brother in law going for a short sea trip once for the benefit of his health 
he took a return berth from london to liverpool and when he got to liverpool the only thing he was anxious about was to sell that return ticket 
it was offered round the town at a tremendous reduction so i am told and was eventually sold for eighteenpence to a bilious looking youth who had just been advised by his medical men to go to the sea side and take exercise 
 sea side  
said my brother in law pressing the ticket affectionately into his hand why you ll have enough to last you a lifetime and as for exercise 
why you ll get more exercise sitting down on that ship than you would turning somersaults on dry land  
he himself  my brother in law  came back by train 
he said the north western railway was healthy enough for him 
another fellow i knew went for a week s voyage round the coast and before they started the steward came to him to ask whether he would pay for each meal as he had it or arrange beforehand for the whole series 
the steward recommended the latter course as it would come so much cheaper 
he said they would do him for the whole week at two pounds five 
he said for breakfast there would be fish followed by a grill 
lunch was at one and consisted of four courses 
dinner at six  soup fish entree joint poultry salad sweets cheese and dessert 
and a light meat supper at ten 
my friend thought he would close on the two pound five job he is a hearty eater  and did so 
lunch came just as they were off sheerness 
he didn t feel so hungry as he thought he should and so contented himself with a bit of boiled beef and some strawberries and cream 
he pondered a good deal during the afternoon and at one time it seemed to him that he had been eating nothing but boiled beef for weeks and at other times it seemed that he must have been living on strawberries and cream for years 
neither the beef nor the strawberries and cream seemed happy either  seemed discontented like 
at six they came and told him dinner was ready 
the announcement aroused no enthusiasm within him but he felt that there was some of that two pound five to be worked off and he held on to ropes and things and went down 
a pleasant odour of onions and hot ham mingled with fried fish and greens greeted him at the bottom of the ladder and then the steward came up with an oily smile and said  what can i get you sir  
 picture man feeling ill get me out of this  was the feeble reply 
and they ran him up quick and propped him up over to leeward and left him 
for the next four days he lived a simple and blameless life on thin captain s biscuits i mean that the biscuits were thin not the captain and soda water but towards saturday he got uppish and went in for weak tea and dry toast and on monday he was gorging himself on chicken broth 
he left the ship on tuesday and as it steamed away from the landing stage he gazed after it regretfully 
 there she goes  he said there she goes with two pounds worth of food on board that belongs to me and that i haven t had  
he said that if they had given him another day he thought he could have put it straight 
so i set my face against the sea trip 
not as i explained upon my own account 
i was never queer 
but i was afraid for george 
george said he should be all right and would rather like it but he would advise harris and me not to think of it as he felt sure we should both be ill harris said that to himself it was always a mystery how people managed to get sick at sea  said he thought people must do it on purpose from affectation  said he had often wished to be but had never been able 
then he told us anecdotes of how he had gone across the channel when it was so rough that the passengers had to be tied into their berths and he and the captain were the only two living souls on board who were not ill 
sometimes it was he and the second mate who were not ill but it was generally he and one other man 
if not he and another man then it was he by himself 
it is a curious fact but nobody ever is sea sick  on land 
at sea you come across plenty of people very bad indeed whole boat loads of them but i never met a man yet on land who had ever known at all what it was to be sea sick 
where the thousands upon thousands of bad sailors that swarm in every ship hide themselves when they are on land is a mystery 
if most men were like a fellow i saw on the yarmouth boat one day i could account for the seeming enigma easily enough 
it was just off southend pier i recollect and he was leaning out through one of the port holes in a very dangerous position 
i went up to him to try and save him 
 hi 
come further in  i said shaking him by the shoulder 
 you ll be overboard  
 oh my 
i wish i was  was the only answer i could get and there i had to leave him 
three weeks afterwards i met him in the coffee room of a bath hotel talking about his voyages and explaining with enthusiasm how he loved the sea 
 good sailor  
he replied in answer to a mild young man s envious query well i did feel a little queer  once  i confess 
it was off cape horn 
the vessel was wrecked the next morning  
i said  weren t you a little shaky by southend pier one day and wanted to be thrown overboard  
 southend pier  
he replied with a puzzled expression 
 yes going down to yarmouth last friday three weeks  
 oh ah  yes  he answered brightening up i remember now 
i did have a headache that afternoon 
it was the pickles you know 
they were the most disgraceful pickles i ever tasted in a respectable boat 
did  you  have any  
for myself i have discovered an excellent preventive against sea sickness in balancing myself 
you stand in the centre of the deck and as the ship heaves and pitches you move your body about so as to keep it always straight 
when the front of the ship rises you lean forward till the deck almost touches your nose and when its back end gets up you lean backwards 
this is all very well for an hour or two but you can t balance yourself for a week 
george said  let s go up the river  
he said we should have fresh air exercise and quiet the constant change of scene would occupy our minds including what there was of harris s  and the hard work would give us a good appetite and make us sleep well 
harris said he didn t think george ought to do anything that would have a tendency to make him sleepier than he always was as it might be dangerous 
he said he didn t very well understand how george was going to sleep any more than he did now seeing that there were only twenty four hours in each day summer and winter alike but thought that if he  did  sleep any more he might just as well be dead and so save his board and lodging 
harris said however that the river would suit him to a t   i don t know what a t is except a sixpenny one which includes bread and butter and cake  ad lib 
 and is cheap at the price if you haven t had any dinner  
it seems to suit everybody however which is greatly to its credit 
it suited me to a t too and harris and i both said it was a good idea of george s and we said it in a tone that seemed to somehow imply that we were surprised that george should have come out so sensible 
 picture montmorency the only one who was not struck with the suggestion was montmorency 
he never did care for the river did montmorency 
 it s all very well for you fellows  he says you like it but  i  don t 
there s nothing for me to do 
scenery is not in my line and i don t smoke 
if i see a rat you won t stop and if i go to sleep you get fooling about with the boat and slop me overboard 
if you ask me i call the whole thing bally foolishness  
we were three to one however and the motion was carried 
chapter ii 
plans discussed   pleasures of camping out  on fine nights   ditto wet nights   compromise decided on   montmorency first impressions of   fears lest he is too good for this world fears subsequently dismissed as groundless   meeting adjourns 
we pulled out the maps and discussed plans 
we arranged to start on the following saturday from kingston 
harris and i would go down in the morning and take the boat up to chertsey and george who would not be able to get away from the city till the afternoon george goes to sleep at a bank from ten to four each day except saturdays when they wake him up and put him outside at two  would meet us there 
should we camp out or sleep at inns 
george and i were for camping out 
we said it would be so wild and free so patriarchal like 
slowly the golden memory of the dead sun fades from the hearts of the cold sad clouds 
silent like sorrowing children the birds have ceased their song and only the moorhen s plaintive cry and the harsh croak of the corncrake stirs the awed hush around the couch of waters where the dying day breathes out her last 
from the dim woods on either bank night s ghostly army the grey shadows creep out with noiseless tread to chase away the lingering rear guard of the light and pass with noiseless unseen feet above the waving river grass and through the sighing rushes and night upon her sombre throne folds her black wings above the darkening world and from her phantom palace lit by the pale stars reigns in stillness 
 picture river scene  then we run our little boat into some quiet nook and the tent is pitched and the frugal supper cooked and eaten 
then the big pipes are filled and lighted and the pleasant chat goes round in musical undertone while in the pauses of our talk the river playing round the boat prattles strange old tales and secrets sings low the old child s song that it has sung so many thousand years  will sing so many thousand years to come before its voice grows harsh and old  a song that we who have learnt to love its changing face who have so often nestled on its yielding bosom think somehow we understand though we could not tell you in mere words the story that we listen to 
and we sit there by its margin while the moon who loves it too stoops down to kiss it with a sister s kiss and throws her silver arms around it clingingly and we watch it as it flows ever singing ever whispering out to meet its king the sea  till our voices die away in silence and the pipes go out  till we common place everyday young men enough feel strangely full of thoughts half sad half sweet and do not care or want to speak  till we laugh and rising knock the ashes from our burnt out pipes and say good night  and lulled by the lapping water and the rustling trees we fall asleep beneath the great still stars and dream that the world is young again  young and sweet as she used to be ere the centuries of fret and care had furrowed her fair face ere her children s sins and follies had made old her loving heart  sweet as she was in those bygone days when a new made mother she nursed us her children upon her own deep breast  ere the wiles of painted civilization had lured us away from her fond arms and the poisoned sneers of artificiality had made us ashamed of the simple life we led with her and the simple stately home where mankind was born so many thousands years ago 
harris said  how about when it rained  
you can never rouse harris 
there is no poetry about harris  no wild yearning for the unattainable 
harris never weeps he knows not why  
if harris s eyes fill with tears you can bet it is because harris has been eating raw onions or has put too much worcester over his chop 
 picture mermaid if you were to stand at night by the sea shore with harris and say  hark 
do you not hear 
is it but the mermaids singing deep below the waving waters or sad spirits chanting dirges for white corpses held by seaweed  
harris would take you by the arm and say  i know what it is old man you ve got a chill 
now you come along with me 
i know a place round the corner here where you can get a drop of the finest scotch whisky you ever tasted  put you right in less than no time  
harris always does know a place round the corner where you can get something brilliant in the drinking line 
i believe that if you met harris up in paradise supposing such a thing likely  he would immediately greet you with  so glad you ve come old fellow i ve found a nice place round the corner here where you can get some really first class nectar  
in the present instance however as regarded the camping out his practical view of the matter came as a very timely hint 
camping out in rainy weather is not pleasant 
it is evening 
you are wet through and there is a good two inches of water in the boat and all the things are damp 
you find a place on the banks that is not quite so puddly as other places you have seen and you land and lug out the tent and two of you proceed to fix it 
it is soaked and heavy and it flops about and tumbles down on you and clings round your head and makes you mad 
the rain is pouring steadily down all the time 
it is difficult enough to fix a tent in dry weather in wet the task becomes herculean 
instead of helping you it seems to you that the other man is simply playing the fool 
just as you get your side beautifully fixed he gives it a hoist from his end and spoils it all 
 here 
what are you up to  
you call out 
 what are  you  up to  
he retorts leggo can t you  
 don t pull it you ve got it all wrong you stupid ass  
you shout 
 no i haven t  he yells back let go your side  
 i tell you you ve got it all wrong  
you roar wishing that you could get at him and you give your ropes a lug that pulls all his pegs out 
 ah the bally idiot  
you hear him mutter to himself and then comes a savage haul and away goes your side 
you lay down the mallet and start to go round and tell him what you think about the whole business and at the same time he starts round in the same direction to come and explain his views to you 
and you follow each other round and round swearing at one another until the tent tumbles down in a heap and leaves you looking at each other across its ruins when you both indignantly exclaim in the same breath  there you are 
what did i tell you  
meanwhile the third man who has been baling out the boat and who has spilled the water down his sleeve and has been cursing away to himself steadily for the last ten minutes wants to know what the thundering blazes you re playing at and why the blarmed tent isn t up yet 
at last somehow or other it does get up and you land the things 
it is hopeless attempting to make a wood fire so you light the methylated spirit stove and crowd round that 
rainwater is the chief article of diet at supper 
the bread is two thirds rainwater the beefsteak pie is exceedingly rich in it and the jam and the butter and the salt and the coffee have all combined with it to make soup 
after supper you find your tobacco is damp and you cannot smoke 
luckily you have a bottle of the stuff that cheers and inebriates if taken in proper quantity and this restores to you sufficient interest in life to induce you to go to bed 
there you dream that an elephant has suddenly sat down on your chest and that the volcano has exploded and thrown you down to the bottom of the sea  the elephant still sleeping peacefully on your bosom 
you wake up and grasp the idea that something terrible really has happened 
your first impression is that the end of the world has come and then you think that this cannot be and that it is thieves and murderers or else fire and this opinion you express in the usual method 
no help comes however and all you know is that thousands of people are kicking you and you are being smothered 
somebody else seems in trouble too 
you can hear his faint cries coming from underneath your bed 
determining at all events to sell your life dearly you struggle frantically hitting out right and left with arms and legs and yelling lustily the while and at last something gives way and you find your head in the fresh air 
two feet off you dimly observe a half dressed ruffian waiting to kill you and you are preparing for a life and death struggle with him when it begins to dawn upon you that it s jim 
 oh it s you is it  
he says recognising you at the same moment 
 yes  you answer rubbing your eyes what s happened  
 bally tent s blown down i think  he says 
 where s bill  
then you both raise up your voices and shout for bill  
and the ground beneath you heaves and rocks and the muffled voice that you heard before replies from out the ruin  get off my head can t you  
and bill struggles out a muddy trampled wreck and in an unnecessarily aggressive mood  he being under the evident belief that the whole thing has been done on purpose 
in the morning you are all three speechless owing to having caught severe colds in the night you also feel very quarrelsome and you swear at each other in hoarse whispers during the whole of breakfast time 
we therefore decided that we would sleep out on fine nights and hotel it and inn it and pub 
it like respectable folks when it was wet or when we felt inclined for a change 
montmorency hailed this compromise with much approval 
he does not revel in romantic solitude 
give him something noisy and if a trifle low so much the jollier 
to look at montmorency you would imagine that he was an angel sent upon the earth for some reason withheld from mankind in the shape of a small fox terrier 
there is a sort of oh what a wicked world this is and how i wish i could do something to make it better and nobler expression about montmorency that has been known to bring the tears into the eyes of pious old ladies and gentlemen 
when first he came to live at my expense i never thought i should be able to get him to stop long 
i used to sit down and look at him as he sat on the rug and looked up at me and think oh that dog will never live 
he will be snatched up to the bright skies in a chariot that is what will happen to him  
but when i had paid for about a dozen chickens that he had killed and had dragged him growling and kicking by the scruff of his neck out of a hundred and fourteen street fights and had had a dead cat brought round for my inspection by an irate female who called me a murderer and had been summoned by the man next door but one for having a ferocious dog at large that had kept him pinned up in his own tool shed afraid to venture his nose outside the door for over two hours on a cold night and had learned that the gardener unknown to myself had won thirty shillings by backing him to kill rats against time then i began to think that maybe they d let him remain on earth for a bit longer after all 
to hang about a stable and collect a gang of the most disreputable dogs to be found in the town and lead them out to march round the slums to fight other disreputable dogs is montmorency s idea of life  and so as i before observed he gave to the suggestion of inns and pubs  and hotels his most emphatic approbation 
having thus settled the sleeping arrangements to the satisfaction of all four of us the only thing left to discuss was what we should take with us and this we had begun to argue when harris said he d had enough oratory for one night and proposed that we should go out and have a smile saying that he had found a place round by the square where you could really get a drop of irish worth drinking 
 picture whisky glass george said he felt thirsty i never knew george when he didn t  and as i had a presentiment that a little whisky warm with a slice of lemon would do my complaint good the debate was by common assent adjourned to the following night and the assembly put on its hats and went out 
chapter iii 
arrangements settled   harris s method of doing work   how the elderly family man puts up a picture   george makes a sensible remark   delights of early morning bathing   provisions for getting upset 
so on the following evening we again assembled to discuss and arrange our plans 
harris said  now the first thing to settle is what to take with us 
now you get a bit of paper and write down j  and you get the grocery catalogue george and somebody give me a bit of pencil and then i ll make out a list  
that s harris all over  so ready to take the burden of everything himself and put it on the backs of other people 
he always reminds me of my poor uncle podger 
you never saw such a commotion up and down a house in all your life as when my uncle podger undertook to do a job 
a picture would have come home from the frame maker s and be standing in the dining room waiting to be put up and aunt podger would ask what was to be done with it and uncle podger would say  oh you leave that to  me 
don t you any of you worry yourselves about that 
i ll  do all that  
and then he would take off his coat and begin 
he would send the girl out for sixpen orth of nails and then one of the boys after her to tell her what size to get and from that he would gradually work down and start the whole house 
 picture candle now you go and get me my hammer will  he would shout and you bring me the rule tom and i shall want the step ladder and i had better have a kitchen chair too and jim 
you run round to mr goggles and tell him pa s kind regards and hopes his leg s better and will he lend him his spirit level  
and don t you go maria because i shall want somebody to hold me the light and when the girl comes back she must go out again for a bit of picture cord and tom   where s tom   tom you come here i shall want you to hand me up the picture  
and then he would lift up the picture and drop it and it would come out of the frame and he would try to save the glass and cut himself and then he would spring round the room looking for his handkerchief 
he could not find his handkerchief because it was in the pocket of the coat he had taken off and he did not know where he had put the coat and all the house had to leave off looking for his tools and start looking for his coat while he would dance round and hinder them 
 picture nails etc  
 doesn t anybody in the whole house know where my coat is 
i never came across such a set in all my life  upon my word i didn t 
six of you   and you can t find a coat that i put down not five minutes ago 
well of all the    then he d get up and find that he had been sitting on it and would call out  oh you can give it up 
i ve found it myself now 
might just as well ask the cat to find anything as expect you people to find it  
and when half an hour had been spent in tying up his finger and a new glass had been got and the tools and the ladder and the chair and the candle had been brought he would have another go the whole family including the girl and the charwoman standing round in a semi circle ready to help 
two people would have to hold the chair and a third would help him up on it and hold him there and a fourth would hand him a nail and a fifth would pass him up the hammer and he would take hold of the nail and drop it 
 there  
he would say in an injured tone now the nail s gone  
and we would all have to go down on our knees and grovel for it while he would stand on the chair and grunt and want to know if he was to be kept there all the evening 
the nail would be found at last but by that time he would have lost the hammer 
 where s the hammer 
what did i do with the hammer 
great heavens 
seven of you gaping round there and you don t know what i did with the hammer  
we would find the hammer for him and then he would have lost sight of the mark he had made on the wall where the nail was to go in and each of us had to get up on the chair beside him and see if we could find it and we would each discover it in a different place and he would call us all fools one after another and tell us to get down 
and he would take the rule and re measure and find that he wanted half thirty one and three eighths inches from the corner and would try to do it in his head and go mad 
and we would all try to do it in our heads and all arrive at different results and sneer at one another 
and in the general row the original number would be forgotten and uncle podger would have to measure it again 
he would use a bit of string this time and at the critical moment when the old fool was leaning over the chair at an angle of forty five and trying to reach a point three inches beyond what was possible for him to reach the string would slip and down he would slide on to the piano a really fine musical effect being produced by the suddenness with which his head and body struck all the notes at the same time 
and aunt maria would say that she would not allow the children to stand round and hear such language 
at last uncle podger would get the spot fixed again and put the point of the nail on it with his left hand and take the hammer in his right hand 
and with the first blow he would smash his thumb and drop the hammer with a yell on somebody s toes 
aunt maria would mildly observe that next time uncle podger was going to hammer a nail into the wall she hoped he d let her know in time so that she could make arrangements to go and spend a week with her mother while it was being done 
 oh 
you women you make such a fuss over everything  uncle podger would reply picking himself up 
 why i  like  doing a little job of this sort  
 picture uncle podger admiring his work  and then he would have another try and at the second blow the nail would go clean through the plaster and half the hammer after it and uncle podger be precipitated against the wall with force nearly sufficient to flatten his nose 
then we had to find the rule and the string again and a new hole was made and about midnight the picture would be up  very crooked and insecure the wall for yards round looking as if it had been smoothed down with a rake and everybody dead beat and wretched  except uncle podger 
 there you are  he would say stepping heavily off the chair on to the charwoman s corns and surveying the mess he had made with evident pride 
 why some people would have had a man in to do a little thing like that  
harris will be just that sort of man when he grows up i know and i told him so 
i said i could not permit him to take so much labour upon himself 
i said  no  you  get the paper and the pencil and the catalogue and george write down and i ll do the work  
the first list we made out had to be discarded 
it was clear that the upper reaches of the thames would not allow of the navigation of a boat sufficiently large to take the things we had set down as indispensable so we tore the list up and looked at one another 
george said  you know we are on a wrong track altogether 
we must not think of the things we could do with but only of the things that we can t do without  
george comes out really quite sensible at times 
you d be surprised 
i call that downright wisdom not merely as regards the present case but with reference to our trip up the river of life generally 
how many people on that voyage load up the boat till it is ever in danger of swamping with a store of foolish things which they think essential to the pleasure and comfort of the trip but which are really only useless lumber 
how they pile the poor little craft mast high with fine clothes and big houses with useless servants and a host of swell friends that do not care twopence for them and that they do not care three ha pence for with expensive entertainments that nobody enjoys with formalities and fashions with pretence and ostentation and with  oh heaviest maddest lumber of all   the dread of what will my neighbour think with luxuries that only cloy with pleasures that bore with empty show that like the criminal s iron crown of yore makes to bleed and swoon the aching head that wears it 
it is lumber man  all lumber 
throw it overboard 
it makes the boat so heavy to pull you nearly faint at the oars 
it makes it so cumbersome and dangerous to manage you never know a moment s freedom from anxiety and care never gain a moment s rest for dreamy laziness  no time to watch the windy shadows skimming lightly o er the shallows or the glittering sunbeams flitting in and out among the ripples or the great trees by the margin looking down at their own image or the woods all green and golden or the lilies white and yellow or the sombre waving rushes or the sedges or the orchis or the blue forget me nots 
throw the lumber over man 
let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need  a homely home and simple pleasures one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing 
you will find the boat easier to pull then and it will not be so liable to upset and it will not matter so much if it does upset good plain merchandise will stand water 
you will have time to think as well as to work 
time to drink in life s sunshine  time to listen to the aeolian music that the wind of god draws from the human heart strings around us  time to   i beg your pardon really 
i quite forgot 
well we left the list to george and he began it 
 picture tent we won t take a tent  suggested george we will have a boat with a cover 
it is ever so much simpler and more comfortable  
it seemed a good thought and we adopted it 
i do not know whether you have ever seen the thing i mean 
you fix iron hoops up over the boat and stretch a huge canvas over them and fasten it down all round from stem to stern and it converts the boat into a sort of little house and it is beautifully cosy though a trifle stuffy but there everything has its drawbacks as the man said when his mother in law died and they came down upon him for the funeral expenses 
george said that in that case we must take a rug each a lamp some soap a brush and comb between us  a toothbrush each  a basin some tooth powder some shaving tackle sounds like a french exercise doesn t it 
  and a couple of big towels for bathing 
i notice that people always make gigantic arrangements for bathing when they are going anywhere near the water but that they don t bathe much when they are there 
 picture sea side scene it is the same when you go to the sea side 
i always determine  when thinking over the matter in london  that i ll get up early every morning and go and have a dip before breakfast and i religiously pack up a pair of drawers and a bath towel 
i always get red bathing drawers 
i rather fancy myself in red drawers 
they suit my complexion so 
but when i get to the sea i don t feel somehow that i want that early morning bathe nearly so much as i did when i was in town 
on the contrary i feel more that i want to stop in bed till the last moment and then come down and have my breakfast 
once or twice virtue has triumphed and i have got out at six and half dressed myself and have taken my drawers and towel and stumbled dismally off 
but i haven t enjoyed it 
they seem to keep a specially cutting east wind waiting for me when i go to bathe in the early morning and they pick out all the three cornered stones and put them on the top and they sharpen up the rocks and cover the points over with a bit of sand so that i can t see them and they take the sea and put it two miles out so that i have to huddle myself up in my arms and hop shivering through six inches of water 
and when i do get to the sea it is rough and quite insulting 
one huge wave catches me up and chucks me in a sitting posture as hard as ever it can down on to a rock which has been put there for me 
and before i ve said oh 
ugh  
and found out what has gone the wave comes back and carries me out to mid ocean 
i begin to strike out frantically for the shore and wonder if i shall ever see home and friends again and wish i d been kinder to my little sister when a boy when i was a boy i mean  
just when i have given up all hope a wave retires and leaves me sprawling like a star fish on the sand and i get up and look back and find that i ve been swimming for my life in two feet of water 
i hop back and dress and crawl home where i have to pretend i liked it 
in the present instance we all talked as if we were going to have a long swim every morning 
george said it was so pleasant to wake up in the boat in the fresh morning and plunge into the limpid river 
harris said there was nothing like a swim before breakfast to give you an appetite 
he said it always gave him an appetite 
george said that if it was going to make harris eat more than harris ordinarily ate then he should protest against harris having a bath at all 
he said there would be quite enough hard work in towing sufficient food for harris up against stream as it was 
i urged upon george however how much pleasanter it would be to have harris clean and fresh about the boat even if we did have to take a few more hundredweight of provisions and he got to see it in my light and withdrew his opposition to harris s bath 
agreed finally that we should take  three  bath towels so as not to keep each other waiting 
for clothes george said two suits of flannel would be sufficient as we could wash them ourselves in the river when they got dirty 
we asked him if he had ever tried washing flannels in the river and he replied no not exactly himself like but he knew some fellows who had and it was easy enough  and harris and i were weak enough to fancy he knew what he was talking about and that three respectable young men without position or influence and with no experience in washing could really clean their own shirts and trousers in the river thames with a bit of soap 
we were to learn in the days to come when it was too late that george was a miserable impostor who could evidently have known nothing whatever about the matter 
if you had seen these clothes after  but as the shilling shockers say we anticipate 
george impressed upon us to take a change of under things and plenty of socks in case we got upset and wanted a change also plenty of handkerchiefs as they would do to wipe things and a pair of leather boots as well as our boating shoes as we should want them if we got upset 
chapter iv 
the food question   objections to paraffine oil as an atmosphere   advantages of cheese as a travelling companion   a married woman deserts her home   further provision for getting upset   i pack   cussedness of tooth brushes   george and harris pack   awful behaviour of montmorency   we retire to rest 
then we discussed the food question 
george said  begin with breakfast  
 george is so practical  
 now for breakfast we shall want a frying pan    harris said it was indigestible but we merely urged him not to be an ass and george went on    a tea pot and a kettle and a methylated spirit stove  
 no oil  said george with a significant look and harris and i agreed 
we had taken up an oil stove once but never again  
it had been like living in an oil shop that week 
it oozed 
i never saw such a thing as paraffine oil is to ooze 
we kept it in the nose of the boat and from there it oozed down to the rudder impregnating the whole boat and everything in it on its way and it oozed over the river and saturated the scenery and spoilt the atmosphere 
sometimes a westerly oily wind blew and at other times an easterly oily wind and sometimes it blew a northerly oily wind and maybe a southerly oily wind but whether it came from the arctic snows or was raised in the waste of the desert sands it came alike to us laden with the fragrance of paraffine oil 
and that oil oozed up and ruined the sunset and as for the moonbeams they positively reeked of paraffine 
we tried to get away from it at marlow 
we left the boat by the bridge and took a walk through the town to escape it but it followed us 
the whole town was full of oil 
we passed through the church yard and it seemed as if the people had been buried in oil 
the high street stunk of oil we wondered how people could live in it 
and we walked miles upon miles out birmingham way but it was no use the country was steeped in oil 
at the end of that trip we met together at midnight in a lonely field under a blasted oak and took an awful oath we had been swearing for a whole week about the thing in an ordinary middle class way but this was a swell affair   an awful oath never to take paraffine oil with us in a boat again except of course in case of sickness 
therefore in the present instance we confined ourselves to methylated spirit 
even that is bad enough 
you get methylated pie and methylated cake 
but methylated spirit is more wholesome when taken into the system in large quantities than paraffine oil 
for other breakfast things george suggested eggs and bacon which were easy to cook cold meat tea bread and butter and jam 
for lunch he said we could have biscuits cold meat bread and butter and jam  but no cheese 
cheese like oil makes too much of itself 
it wants the whole boat to itself 
it goes through the hamper and gives a cheesy flavour to everything else there 
you can t tell whether you are eating apple pie or german sausage or strawberries and cream 
it all seems cheese 
there is too much odour about cheese 
i remember a friend of mine buying a couple of cheeses at liverpool 
splendid cheeses they were ripe and mellow and with a two hundred horse power scent about them that might have been warranted to carry three miles and knock a man over at two hundred yards 
i was in liverpool at the time and my friend said that if i didn t mind he would get me to take them back with me to london as he should not be coming up for a day or two himself and he did not think the cheeses ought to be kept much longer 
 oh with pleasure dear boy  i replied with pleasure  
i called for the cheeses and took them away in a cab 
it was a ramshackle affair dragged along by a knock kneed broken winded somnambulist which his owner in a moment of enthusiasm during conversation referred to as a horse 
i put the cheeses on the top and we started off at a shamble that would have done credit to the swiftest steam roller ever built and all went merry as a funeral bell until we turned the corner 
there the wind carried a whiff from the cheeses full on to our steed 
it woke him up and with a snort of terror he dashed off at three miles an hour 
the wind still blew in his direction and before we reached the end of the street he was laying himself out at the rate of nearly four miles an hour leaving the cripples and stout old ladies simply nowhere 
it took two porters as well as the driver to hold him in at the station and i do not think they would have done it even then had not one of the men had the presence of mind to put a handkerchief over his nose and to light a bit of brown paper 
i took my ticket and marched proudly up the platform with my cheeses the people falling back respectfully on either side 
the train was crowded and i had to get into a carriage where there were already seven other people 
one crusty old gentleman objected but i got in notwithstanding and putting my cheeses upon the rack squeezed down with a pleasant smile and said it was a warm day 
a few moments passed and then the old gentleman began to fidget 
 very close in here  he said 
 quite oppressive  said the man next him 
and then they both began sniffing and at the third sniff they caught it right on the chest and rose up without another word and went out 
and then a stout lady got up and said it was disgraceful that a respectable married woman should be harried about in this way and gathered up a bag and eight parcels and went 
the remaining four passengers sat on for a while until a solemn looking man in the corner who from his dress and general appearance seemed to belong to the undertaker class said it put him in mind of dead baby and the other three passengers tried to get out of the door at the same time and hurt themselves 
 picture railway carriage  i smiled at the black gentleman and said i thought we were going to have the carriage to ourselves and he laughed pleasantly and said that some people made such a fuss over a little thing 
but even he grew strangely depressed after we had started and so when we reached crewe i asked him to come and have a drink 
he accepted and we forced our way into the buffet where we yelled and stamped and waved our umbrellas for a quarter of an hour and then a young lady came and asked us if we wanted anything 
 what s yours  
i said turning to my friend 
 i ll have half a crown s worth of brandy neat if you please miss  he responded 
and he went off quietly after he had drunk it and got into another carriage which i thought mean 
from crewe i had the compartment to myself though the train was crowded 
as we drew up at the different stations the people seeing my empty carriage would rush for it 
 here y are maria come along plenty of room  
 all right tom we ll get in here  they would shout 
and they would run along carrying heavy bags and fight round the door to get in first 
and one would open the door and mount the steps and stagger back into the arms of the man behind him and they would all come and have a sniff and then droop off and squeeze into other carriages or pay the difference and go first 
from euston i took the cheeses down to my friend s house 
when his wife came into the room she smelt round for an instant 
then she said  what is it 
tell me the worst  
i said  it s cheeses 
tom bought them in liverpool and asked me to bring them up with me  
and i added that i hoped she understood that it had nothing to do with me and she said that she was sure of that but that she would speak to tom about it when he came back 
my friend was detained in liverpool longer than he expected and three days later as he hadn t returned home his wife called on me 
she said  what did tom say about those cheeses  
i replied that he had directed they were to be kept in a moist place and that nobody was to touch them 
she said  nobody s likely to touch them 
had he smelt them  
i thought he had and added that he seemed greatly attached to them 
 you think he would be upset  she queried if i gave a man a sovereign to take them away and bury them  
i answered that i thought he would never smile again 
an idea struck her 
she said  do you mind keeping them for him 
let me send them round to you  
 madam  i replied for myself i like the smell of cheese and the journey the other day with them from liverpool i shall ever look back upon as a happy ending to a pleasant holiday 
but in this world we must consider others 
the lady under whose roof i have the honour of residing is a widow and for all i know possibly an orphan too 
she has a strong i may say an eloquent objection to being what she terms put upon  
the presence of your husband s cheeses in her house she would i instinctively feel regard as a put upon  and it shall never be said that i put upon the widow and the orphan  
 very well then  said my friend s wife rising all i have to say is that i shall take the children and go to an hotel until those cheeses are eaten 
i decline to live any longer in the same house with them  
she kept her word leaving the place in charge of the charwoman who when asked if she could stand the smell replied what smell  
and who when taken close to the cheeses and told to sniff hard said she could detect a faint odour of melons 
it was argued from this that little injury could result to the woman from the atmosphere and she was left 
the hotel bill came to fifteen guineas and my friend after reckoning everything up found that the cheeses had cost him eight and sixpence a pound 
he said he dearly loved a bit of cheese but it was beyond his means so he determined to get rid of them 
he threw them into the canal but had to fish them out again as the bargemen complained 
they said it made them feel quite faint 
and after that he took them one dark night and left them in the parish mortuary 
but the coroner discovered them and made a fearful fuss 
he said it was a plot to deprive him of his living by waking up the corpses 
my friend got rid of them at last by taking them down to a sea side town and burying them on the beach 
it gained the place quite a reputation 
visitors said they had never noticed before how strong the air was and weak chested and consumptive people used to throng there for years afterwards 
fond as i am of cheese therefore i hold that george was right in declining to take any 
 we shan t want any tea  said george harris s face fell at this  but we ll have a good round square slap up meal at seven  dinner tea and supper combined  
harris grew more cheerful 
george suggested meat and fruit pies cold meat tomatoes fruit and green stuff 
for drink we took some wonderful sticky concoction of harris s which you mixed with water and called lemonade plenty of tea and a bottle of whisky in case as george said we got upset 
it seemed to me that george harped too much on the getting upset idea 
it seemed to me the wrong spirit to go about the trip in 
but i m glad we took the whisky 
we didn t take beer or wine 
they are a mistake up the river 
they make you feel sleepy and heavy 
a glass in the evening when you are doing a mouch round the town and looking at the girls is all right enough but don t drink when the sun is blazing down on your head and you ve got hard work to do 
we made a list of the things to be taken and a pretty lengthy one it was before we parted that evening 
the next day which was friday we got them all together and met in the evening to pack 
we got a big gladstone for the clothes and a couple of hampers for the victuals and the cooking utensils 
we moved the table up against the window piled everything in a heap in the middle of the floor and sat round and looked at it 
i said i d pack 
i rather pride myself on my packing 
packing is one of those many things that i feel i know more about than any other person living 
 it surprises me myself sometimes how many of these subjects there are  
i impressed the fact upon george and harris and told them that they had better leave the whole matter entirely to me 
they fell into the suggestion with a readiness that had something uncanny about it 
george put on a pipe and spread himself over the easy chair and harris cocked his legs on the table and lit a cigar 
this was hardly what i intended 
what i had meant of course was that i should boss the job and that harris and george should potter about under my directions i pushing them aside every now and then with oh you    
 here let me do it  
 there you are simple enough  
  really teaching them as you might say 
their taking it in the way they did irritated me 
there is nothing does irritate me more than seeing other people sitting about doing nothing when i m working 
i lived with a man once who used to make me mad that way 
he would loll on the sofa and watch me doing things by the hour together following me round the room with his eyes wherever i went 
he said it did him real good to look on at me messing about 
he said it made him feel that life was not an idle dream to be gaped and yawned through but a noble task full of duty and stern work 
he said he often wondered now how he could have gone on before he met me never having anybody to look at while they worked 
now i m not like that 
i can t sit still and see another man slaving and working 
i want to get up and superintend and walk round with my hands in my pockets and tell him what to do 
it is my energetic nature 
i can t help it 
however i did not say anything but started the packing 
it seemed a longer job than i had thought it was going to be but i got the bag finished at last and i sat on it and strapped it 
 ain t you going to put the boots in  
said harris 
and i looked round and found i had forgotten them 
that s just like harris 
he couldn t have said a word until i d got the bag shut and strapped of course 
and george laughed  one of those irritating senseless chuckle headed crack jawed laughs of his 
they do make me so wild 
i opened the bag and packed the boots in and then just as i was going to close it a horrible idea occurred to me 
had i packed my tooth brush 
i don t know how it is but i never do know whether i ve packed my tooth brush 
my tooth brush is a thing that haunts me when i m travelling and makes my life a misery 
i dream that i haven t packed it and wake up in a cold perspiration and get out of bed and hunt for it 
and in the morning i pack it before i have used it and have to unpack again to get it and it is always the last thing i turn out of the bag and then i repack and forget it and have to rush upstairs for it at the last moment and carry it to the railway station wrapped up in my pocket handkerchief 
 picture boot of course i had to turn every mortal thing out now and of course i could not find it 
i rummaged the things up into much the same state that they must have been before the world was created and when chaos reigned 
of course i found george s and harris s eighteen times over but i couldn t find my own 
i put the things back one by one and held everything up and shook it 
then i found it inside a boot 
i repacked once more 
when i had finished george asked if the soap was in 
i said i didn t care a hang whether the soap was in or whether it wasn t and i slammed the bag to and strapped it and found that i had packed my tobacco pouch in it and had to re open it 
it got shut up finally at    p m  and then there remained the hampers to do 
harris said that we should be wanting to start in less than twelve hours time and thought that he and george had better do the rest and i agreed and sat down and they had a go 
they began in a light hearted spirit evidently intending to show me how to do it 
i made no comment i only waited 
when george is hanged harris will be the worst packer in this world and i looked at the piles of plates and cups and kettles and bottles and jars and pies and stoves and cakes and tomatoes c  and felt that the thing would soon become exciting 
it did 
they started with breaking a cup 
that was the first thing they did 
they did that just to show you what they  could  do and to get you interested 
then harris packed the strawberry jam on top of a tomato and squashed it and they had to pick out the tomato with a teaspoon 
and then it was george s turn and he trod on the butter 
i didn t say anything but i came over and sat on the edge of the table and watched them 
it irritated them more than anything i could have said 
i felt that 
it made them nervous and excited and they stepped on things and put things behind them and then couldn t find them when they wanted them and they packed the pies at the bottom and put heavy things on top and smashed the pies in 
they upset salt over everything and as for the butter 
i never saw two men do more with one and twopence worth of butter in my whole life than they did 
after george had got it off his slipper they tried to put it in the kettle 
it wouldn t go in and what  was  in wouldn t come out 
they did scrape it out at last and put it down on a chair and harris sat on it and it stuck to him and they went looking for it all over the room 
 i ll take my oath i put it down on that chair  said george staring at the empty seat 
 i saw you do it myself not a minute ago  said harris 
then they started round the room again looking for it and then they met again in the centre and stared at one another 
 most extraordinary thing i ever heard of  said george 
 so mysterious  
said harris 
then george got round at the back of harris and saw it 
 why here it is all the time  he exclaimed indignantly 
 where  
cried harris spinning round 
 stand still can t you  
roared george flying after him 
and they got it off and packed it in the teapot 
montmorency was in it all of course 
montmorency s ambition in life is to get in the way and be sworn at 
if he can squirm in anywhere where he particularly is not wanted and be a perfect nuisance and make people mad and have things thrown at his head then he feels his day has not been wasted 
to get somebody to stumble over him and curse him steadily for an hour is his highest aim and object and when he has succeeded in accomplishing this his conceit becomes quite unbearable 
he came and sat down on things just when they were wanted to be packed and he laboured under the fixed belief that whenever harris or george reached out their hand for anything it was his cold damp nose that they wanted 
he put his leg into the jam and he worried the teaspoons and he pretended that the lemons were rats and got into the hamper and killed three of them before harris could land him with the frying pan 
harris said i encouraged him 
i didn t encourage him 
a dog like that don t want any encouragement 
it s the natural original sin that is born in him that makes him do things like that 
the packing was done at      and harris sat on the big hamper and said he hoped nothing would be found broken 
george said that if anything was broken it was broken which reflection seemed to comfort him 
he also said he was ready for bed 
we were all ready for bed 
harris was to sleep with us that night and we went upstairs 
we tossed for beds and harris had to sleep with me 
he said  do you prefer the inside or the outside j   
i said i generally preferred to sleep  inside  a bed 
harris said it was old 
george said  what time shall i wake you fellows  
harris said  seven  
i said  no  six  because i wanted to write some letters 
harris and i had a bit of a row over it but at last split the difference and said half past six 
 wake us at     george  we said 
george made no answer and we found on going over that he had been asleep for some time so we placed the bath where he could tumble into it on getting out in the morning and went to bed ourselves 
 picture luggage with dog on top     chapter v   mrs p arouses us   george the sluggard   the weather forecast swindle   our luggage   depravity of the small boy   the people gather round us   we drive off in great style and arrive at waterloo   innocence of south western officials concerning such worldly things as trains   we are afloat afloat in an open boat 
 picture mrs poppets it was mrs poppets that woke me up next morning 
she said  do you know that it s nearly nine o clock sir  
 nine o what  
i cried starting up 
 nine o clock  she replied through the keyhole 
 i thought you was a oversleeping yourselves  
i woke harris and told him 
he said  i thought you wanted to get up at six  
 so i did  i answered why didn t you wake me  
 how could i wake you when you didn t wake me  
he retorted 
 now we shan t get on the water till after twelve 
i wonder you take the trouble to get up at all  
 um  i replied lucky for you that i do 
if i hadn t woke you you d have lain there for the whole fortnight  
 picture george snoring we snarled at one another in this strain for the next few minutes when we were interrupted by a defiant snore from george 
it reminded us for the first time since our being called of his existence 
there he lay  the man who had wanted to know what time he should wake us  on his back with his mouth wide open and his knees stuck up 
i don t know why it should be i am sure but the sight of another man asleep in bed when i am up maddens me 
it seems to me so shocking to see the precious hours of a man s life  the priceless moments that will never come back to him again  being wasted in mere brutish sleep 
there was george throwing away in hideous sloth the inestimable gift of time his valuable life every second of which he would have to account for hereafter passing away from him unused 
he might have been up stuffing himself with eggs and bacon irritating the dog or flirting with the slavey instead of sprawling there sunk in soul clogging oblivion 
it was a terrible thought 
harris and i appeared to be struck by it at the same instant 
we determined to save him and in this noble resolve our own dispute was forgotten 
we flew across and slung the clothes off him and harris landed him one with a slipper and i shouted in his ear and he awoke 
 wasermarrer  
he observed sitting up 
 get up you fat headed chunk  
roared harris 
 it s quarter to ten  
 what  
he shrieked jumping out of bed into the bath who the thunder put this thing here  
we told him he must have been a fool not to see the bath 
we finished dressing and when it came to the extras we remembered that we had packed the tooth brushes and the brush and comb that tooth brush of mine will be the death of me i know  and we had to go downstairs and fish them out of the bag 
and when we had done that george wanted the shaving tackle 
we told him that he would have to go without shaving that morning as we weren t going to unpack that bag again for him nor for anyone like him 
he said  don t be absurd 
how can i go into the city like this  
it was certainly rather rough on the city but what cared we for human suffering 
as harris said in his common vulgar way the city would have to lump it 
 picture two dogs and umbrella we went downstairs to breakfast 
montmorency had invited two other dogs to come and see him off and they were whiling away the time by fighting on the doorstep 
we calmed them with an umbrella and sat down to chops and cold beef 
harris said  the great thing is to make a good breakfast  and he started with a couple of chops saying that he would take these while they were hot as the beef could wait 
george got hold of the paper and read us out the boating fatalities and the weather forecast which latter prophesied rain cold wet to fine whatever more than usually ghastly thing in weather that may be  occasional local thunder storms east wind with general depression over the midland counties london and channel  
bar 
falling  
i do think that of all the silly irritating tomfoolishness by which we are plagued this weather forecast fraud is about the most aggravating 
it forecasts precisely what happened yesterday or the day before and precisely the opposite of what is going to happen to day 
i remember a holiday of mine being completely ruined one late autumn by our paying attention to the weather report of the local newspaper 
 heavy showers with thunderstorms may be expected to day  it would say on monday and so we would give up our picnic and stop indoors all day waiting for the rain   and people would pass the house going off in wagonettes and coaches as jolly and merry as could be the sun shining out and not a cloud to be seen 
 ah  
we said as we stood looking out at them through the window won t they come home soaked  
and we chuckled to think how wet they were going to get and came back and stirred the fire and got our books and arranged our specimens of seaweed and cockle shells 
by twelve o clock with the sun pouring into the room the heat became quite oppressive and we wondered when those heavy showers and occasional thunderstorms were going to begin 
 ah 
they ll come in the afternoon you ll find  we said to each other 
 oh  won t  those people get wet 
what a lark  
at one o clock the landlady would come in to ask if we weren t going out as it seemed such a lovely day 
 no no  we replied with a knowing chuckle not we 
we  don t mean to get wet  no no  
and when the afternoon was nearly gone and still there was no sign of rain we tried to cheer ourselves up with the idea that it would come down all at once just as the people had started for home and were out of the reach of any shelter and that they would thus get more drenched than ever 
but not a drop ever fell and it finished a grand day and a lovely night after it 
the next morning we would read that it was going to be a warm fine to set fair day much heat  and we would dress ourselves in flimsy things and go out and half an hour after we had started it would commence to rain hard and a bitterly cold wind would spring up and both would keep on steadily for the whole day and we would come home with colds and rheumatism all over us and go to bed 
the weather is a thing that is beyond me altogether 
i never can understand it 
the barometer is useless it is as misleading as the newspaper forecast 
there was one hanging up in a hotel at oxford at which i was staying last spring and when i got there it was pointing to set fair  
it was simply pouring with rain outside and had been all day and i couldn t quite make matters out 
i tapped the barometer and it jumped up and pointed to very dry  
the boots stopped as he was passing and said he expected it meant to morrow 
i fancied that maybe it was thinking of the week before last but boots said no he thought not 
i tapped it again the next morning and it went up still higher and the rain came down faster than ever 
on wednesday i went and hit it again and the pointer went round towards set fair  very dry  and much heat  until it was stopped by the peg and couldn t go any further 
it tried its best but the instrument was built so that it couldn t prophesy fine weather any harder than it did without breaking itself 
it evidently wanted to go on and prognosticate drought and water famine and sunstroke and simooms and such things but the peg prevented it and it had to be content with pointing to the mere commonplace very dry  
meanwhile the rain came down in a steady torrent and the lower part of the town was under water owing to the river having overflowed 
boots said it was evident that we were going to have a prolonged spell of grand weather  some time  and read out a poem which was printed over the top of the oracle about  long foretold long last short notice soon past  
the fine weather never came that summer 
i expect that machine must have been referring to the following spring 
then there are those new style of barometers the long straight ones 
i never can make head or tail of those 
there is one side for  a m yesterday and one side for  a m to day but you can t always get there as early as ten you know 
it rises or falls for rain and fine with much or less wind and one end is nly and the other ely what s ely got to do with it 
  and if you tap it it doesn t tell you anything 
and you ve got to correct it to sea level and reduce it to fahrenheit and even then i don t know the answer 
but who wants to be foretold the weather 
it is bad enough when it comes without our having the misery of knowing about it beforehand 
the prophet we like is the old man who on the particularly gloomy looking morning of some day when we particularly want it to be fine looks round the horizon with a particularly knowing eye and says  oh no sir i think it will clear up all right 
it will break all right enough sir  
 ah he knows  we say as we wish him good morning and start off wonderful how these old fellows can tell  
and we feel an affection for that man which is not at all lessened by the circumstances of its  not  clearing up but continuing to rain steadily all day 
 ah well  we feel he did his best  
for the man that prophesies us bad weather on the contrary we entertain only bitter and revengeful thoughts 
 going to clear up d ye think  
we shout cheerily as we pass 
 well no sir i m afraid it s settled down for the day  he replies shaking his head 
 stupid old fool  
we mutter what s  he  know about it  
and if his portent proves correct we come back feeling still more angry against him and with a vague notion that somehow or other he has had something to do with it 
it was too bright and sunny on this especial morning for george s blood curdling readings about bar 
falling  atmospheric disturbance passing in an oblique line over southern europe  and pressure increasing  to very much upset us and so finding that he could not make us wretched and was only wasting his time he sneaked the cigarette that i had carefully rolled up for myself and went 
then harris and i having finished up the few things left on the table carted out our luggage on to the doorstep and waited for a cab 
 picture the luggage  there seemed a good deal of luggage when we put it all together 
there was the gladstone and the small hand bag and the two hampers and a large roll of rugs and some four or five overcoats and macintoshes and a few umbrellas and then there was a melon by itself in a bag because it was too bulky to go in anywhere and a couple of pounds of grapes in another bag and a japanese paper umbrella and a frying pan which being too long to pack we had wrapped round with brown paper 
it did look a lot and harris and i began to feel rather ashamed of it though why we should be i can t see 
no cab came by but the street boys did and got interested in the show apparently and stopped 
biggs s boy was the first to come round 
biggs is our greengrocer and his chief talent lies in securing the services of the most abandoned and unprincipled errand boys that civilisation has as yet produced 
if anything more than usually villainous in the boy line crops up in our neighbourhood we know that it is biggs s latest 
i was told that at the time of the great coram street murder it was promptly concluded by our street that biggs s boy for that period was at the bottom of it and had he not been able in reply to the severe cross examination to which he was subjected by no 
   when he called there for orders the morning after the crime assisted by no 
   who happened to be on the step at the time  to prove a complete  alibi  it would have gone hard with him 
i didn t know biggs s boy at that time but from what i have seen of them since i should not have attached much importance to that alibi  myself 
biggs s boy as i have said came round the corner 
he was evidently in a great hurry when he first dawned upon the vision but on catching sight of harris and me and montmorency and the things he eased up and stared 
harris and i frowned at him 
this might have wounded a more sensitive nature but biggs s boys are not as a rule touchy 
he came to a dead stop a yard from our step and leaning up against the railings and selecting a straw to chew fixed us with his eye 
he evidently meant to see this thing out 
in another moment the grocer s boy passed on the opposite side of the street 
biggs s boy hailed him  hi 
ground floor o   s a moving  
the grocer s boy came across and took up a position on the other side of the step 
then the young gentleman from the boot shop stopped and joined biggs s boy while the empty can superintendent from the blue posts took up an independent position on the curb 
 they ain t a going to starve are they  
said the gentleman from the boot shop 
 ah 
you d want to take a thing or two with  you  retorted the blue posts  if you was a going to cross the atlantic in a small boat  
 they ain t a going to cross the atlantic  struck in biggs s boy they re a going to find stanley  
by this time quite a small crowd had collected and people were asking each other what was the matter 
one party the young and giddy portion of the crowd held that it was a wedding and pointed out harris as the bridegroom while the elder and more thoughtful among the populace inclined to the idea that it was a funeral and that i was probably the corpse s brother 
at last an empty cab turned up it is a street where as a rule and when they are not wanted empty cabs pass at the rate of three a minute and hang about and get in your way  and packing ourselves and our belongings into it and shooting out a couple of montmorency s friends who had evidently sworn never to forsake him we drove away amidst the cheers of the crowd biggs s boy shying a carrot after us for luck 
we got to waterloo at eleven and asked where the eleven five started from 
of course nobody knew nobody at waterloo ever does know where a train is going to start from or where a train when it does start is going to or anything about it 
the porter who took our things thought it would go from number two platform while another porter with whom he discussed the question had heard a rumour that it would go from number one 
the station master on the other hand was convinced it would start from the local 
to put an end to the matter we went upstairs and asked the traffic superintendent and he told us that he had just met a man who said he had seen it at number three platform 
we went to number three platform but the authorities there said that they rather thought that train was the southampton express or else the windsor loop 
but they were sure it wasn t the kingston train though why they were sure it wasn t they couldn t say 
then our porter said he thought that must be it on the high level platform said he thought he knew the train 
so we went to the high level platform and saw the engine driver and asked him if he was going to kingston 
he said he couldn t say for certain of course but that he rather thought he was 
anyhow if he wasn t the    for kingston he said he was pretty confident he was the    for virginia water or the  a m express for the isle of wight or somewhere in that direction and we should all know when we got there 
we slipped half a crown into his hand and begged him to be the    for kingston 
 nobody will ever know on this line  we said what you are or where you re going 
you know the way you slip off quietly and go to kingston  
 well i don t know gents  replied the noble fellow but i suppose some  train s got to go to kingston and i ll do it 
gimme the half crown  
thus we got to kingston by the london and south western railway 
we learnt afterwards that the train we had come by was really the exeter mail and that they had spent hours at waterloo looking for it and nobody knew what had become of it 
our boat was waiting for us at kingston just below bridge and to it we wended our way and round it we stored our luggage and into it we stepped 
 are you all right sir  
said the man 
 right it is  we answered and with harris at the sculls and i at the tiller lines and montmorency unhappy and deeply suspicious in the prow out we shot on to the waters which for a fortnight were to be our home 
chapter vi 
kingston   instructive remarks on early english history   instructive observations on carved oak and life in general   sad case of stivvings junior   musings on antiquity   i forget that i am steering   interesting result   hampton court maze   harris as a guide 
it was a glorious morning late spring or early summer as you care to take it when the dainty sheen of grass and leaf is blushing to a deeper green and the year seems like a fair young maid trembling with strange wakening pulses on the brink of womanhood 
the quaint back streets of kingston where they came down to the water s edge looked quite picturesque in the flashing sunlight the glinting river with its drifting barges the wooded towpath the trim kept villas on the other side harris in a red and orange blazer grunting away at the sculls the distant glimpses of the grey old palace of the tudors all made a sunny picture so bright but calm so full of life and yet so peaceful that early in the day though it was i felt myself being dreamily lulled off into a musing fit 
i mused on kingston or kyningestun  as it was once called in the days when saxon kinges were crowned there 
great caesar crossed the river there and the roman legions camped upon its sloping uplands 
caesar like in later years elizabeth seems to have stopped everywhere only he was more respectable than good queen bess he didn t put up at the public houses 
she was nuts on public houses was england s virgin queen 
there s scarcely a pub 
of any attractions within ten miles of london that she does not seem to have looked in at or stopped at or slept at some time or other 
i wonder now supposing harris say turned over a new leaf and became a great and good man and got to be prime minister and died if they would put up signs over the public houses that he had patronised harris had a glass of bitter in this house  harris had two of scotch cold here in the summer of     harris was chucked from here in december      
no there would be too many of them 
it would be the houses that he had never entered that would become famous 
 only house in south london that harris never had a drink in  
the people would flock to it to see what could have been the matter with it 
how poor weak minded king edwy must have hated kyningestun 
the coronation feast had been too much for him 
maybe boar s head stuffed with sugar plums did not agree with him it wouldn t with me i know  and he had had enough of sack and mead so he slipped from the noisy revel to steal a quiet moonlight hour with his beloved elgiva 
perhaps from the casement standing hand in hand they were watching the calm moonlight on the river while from the distant halls the boisterous revelry floated in broken bursts of faint heard din and tumult 
then brutal odo and st dunstan force their rude way into the quiet room and hurl coarse insults at the sweet faced queen and drag poor edwy back to the loud clamour of the drunken brawl 
years later to the crash of battle music saxon kings and saxon revelry were buried side by side and kingston s greatness passed away for a time to rise once more when hampton court became the palace of the tudors and the stuarts and the royal barges strained at their moorings on the river s bank and bright cloaked gallants swaggered down the water steps to cry what ferry ho 
gadzooks gramercy  
many of the old houses round about speak very plainly of those days when kingston was a royal borough and nobles and courtiers lived there near their king and the long road to the palace gates was gay all day with clanking steel and prancing palfreys and rustling silks and velvets and fair faces 
the large and spacious houses with their oriel latticed windows their huge fireplaces and their gabled roofs breathe of the days of hose and doublet of pearl embroidered stomachers and complicated oaths 
they were upraised in the days when men knew how to build  
the hard red bricks have only grown more firmly set with time and their oak stairs do not creak and grunt when you try to go down them quietly 
speaking of oak staircases reminds me that there is a magnificent carved oak staircase in one of the houses in kingston 
it is a shop now in the market place but it was evidently once the mansion of some great personage 
a friend of mine who lives at kingston went in there to buy a hat one day and in a thoughtless moment put his hand in his pocket and paid for it then and there 
the shopman he knows my friend was naturally a little staggered at first but quickly recovering himself and feeling that something ought to be done to encourage this sort of thing asked our hero if he would like to see some fine old carved oak 
my friend said he would and the shopman thereupon took him through the shop and up the staircase of the house 
the balusters were a superb piece of workmanship and the wall all the way up was oak panelled with carving that would have done credit to a palace 
from the stairs they went into the drawing room which was a large bright room decorated with a somewhat startling though cheerful paper of a blue ground 
there was nothing however remarkable about the apartment and my friend wondered why he had been brought there 
the proprietor went up to the paper and tapped it 
it gave forth a wooden sound 
 oak  he explained 
 all carved oak right up to the ceiling just the same as you saw on the staircase  
 but great caesar 
man  expostulated my friend you don t mean to say you have covered over carved oak with blue wall paper  
 yes  was the reply it was expensive work 
had to match board it all over first of course 
but the room looks cheerful now 
it was awful gloomy before  
i can t say i altogether blame the man which is doubtless a great relief to his mind  
from his point of view which would be that of the average householder desiring to take life as lightly as possible and not that of the old curiosity shop maniac there is reason on his side 
carved oak is very pleasant to look at and to have a little of but it is no doubt somewhat depressing to live in for those whose fancy does not lie that way 
it would be like living in a church 
no what was sad in his case was that he who didn t care for carved oak should have his drawing room panelled with it while people who do care for it have to pay enormous prices to get it 
it seems to be the rule of this world 
each person has what he doesn t want and other people have what he does want 
married men have wives and don t seem to want them and young single fellows cry out that they can t get them 
poor people who can hardly keep themselves have eight hearty children 
rich old couples with no one to leave their money to die childless 
then there are girls with lovers 
the girls that have lovers never want them 
they say they would rather be without them that they bother them and why don t they go and make love to miss smith and miss brown who are plain and elderly and haven t got any lovers 
they themselves don t want lovers 
they never mean to marry 
it does not do to dwell on these things it makes one so sad 
there was a boy at our school we used to call him sandford and merton 
his real name was stivvings 
he was the most extraordinary lad i ever came across 
i believe he really liked study 
he used to get into awful rows for sitting up in bed and reading greek and as for french irregular verbs there was simply no keeping him away from them 
he was full of weird and unnatural notions about being a credit to his parents and an honour to the school and he yearned to win prizes and grow up and be a clever man and had all those sorts of weak minded ideas 
i never knew such a strange creature yet harmless mind you as the babe unborn 
well that boy used to get ill about twice a week so that he couldn t go to school 
there never was such a boy to get ill as that sandford and merton 
if there was any known disease going within ten miles of him he had it and had it badly 
he would take bronchitis in the dog days and have hay fever at christmas 
after a six weeks period of drought he would be stricken down with rheumatic fever and he would go out in a november fog and come home with a sunstroke 
they put him under laughing gas one year poor lad and drew all his teeth and gave him a false set because he suffered so terribly with toothache and then it turned to neuralgia and ear ache 
he was never without a cold except once for nine weeks while he had scarlet fever and he always had chilblains 
during the great cholera scare of     our neighbourhood was singularly free from it 
there was only one reputed case in the whole parish that case was young stivvings 
he had to stop in bed when he was ill and eat chicken and custards and hot house grapes and he would lie there and sob because they wouldn t let him do latin exercises and took his german grammar away from him 
and we other boys who would have sacrificed ten terms of our school life for the sake of being ill for a day and had no desire whatever to give our parents any excuse for being stuck up about us couldn t catch so much as a stiff neck 
we fooled about in draughts and it did us good and freshened us up and we took things to make us sick and they made us fat and gave us an appetite 
nothing we could think of seemed to make us ill until the holidays began 
then on the breaking up day we caught colds and whooping cough and all kinds of disorders which lasted till the term recommenced when in spite of everything we could manoeuvre to the contrary we would get suddenly well again and be better than ever 
such is life and we are but as grass that is cut down and put into the oven and baked 
to go back to the carved oak question they must have had very fair notions of the artistic and the beautiful our great great grandfathers 
why all our art treasures of to day are only the dug up commonplaces of three or four hundred years ago 
i wonder if there is real intrinsic beauty in the old soup plates beer mugs and candle snuffers that we prize so now or if it is only the halo of age glowing around them that gives them their charms in our eyes 
the old blue that we hang about our walls as ornaments were the common every day household utensils of a few centuries ago and the pink shepherds and the yellow shepherdesses that we hand round now for all our friends to gush over and pretend they understand were the unvalued mantel ornaments that the mother of the eighteenth century would have given the baby to suck when he cried 
will it be the same in the future 
will the prized treasures of to day always be the cheap trifles of the day before 
will rows of our willow pattern dinner plates be ranged above the chimneypieces of the great in the years    and odd 
will the white cups with the gold rim and the beautiful gold flower inside species unknown  that our sarah janes now break in sheer light heartedness of spirit be carefully mended and stood upon a bracket and dusted only by the lady of the house 
 picture china dog that china dog that ornaments the bedroom of my furnished lodgings 
it is a white dog 
its eyes blue 
its nose is a delicate red with spots 
its head is painfully erect its expression is amiability carried to verge of imbecility 
i do not admire it myself 
considered as a work of art i may say it irritates me 
thoughtless friends jeer at it and even my landlady herself has no admiration for it and excuses its presence by the circumstance that her aunt gave it to her 
but in   years time it is more than probable that that dog will be dug up from somewhere or other minus its legs and with its tail broken and will be sold for old china and put in a glass cabinet 
and people will pass it round and admire it 
they will be struck by the wonderful depth of the colour on the nose and speculate as to how beautiful the bit of the tail that is lost no doubt was 
we in this age do not see the beauty of that dog 
we are too familiar with it 
it is like the sunset and the stars we are not awed by their loveliness because they are common to our eyes 
so it is with that china dog 
in    people will gush over it 
the making of such dogs will have become a lost art 
our descendants will wonder how we did it and say how clever we were 
we shall be referred to lovingly as those grand old artists that flourished in the nineteenth century and produced those china dogs  
the sampler that the eldest daughter did at school will be spoken of as tapestry of the victorian era  and be almost priceless 
the blue and white mugs of the present day roadside inn will be hunted up all cracked and chipped and sold for their weight in gold and rich people will use them for claret cups and travellers from japan will buy up all the presents from ramsgate  and souvenirs of margate  that may have escaped destruction and take them back to jedo as ancient english curios 
at this point harris threw away the sculls got up and left his seat and sat on his back and stuck his legs in the air 
montmorency howled and turned a somersault and the top hamper jumped up and all the things came out 
i was somewhat surprised but i did not lose my temper 
i said pleasantly enough  hulloa 
what s that for  
 what s that for 
why    no on second thoughts i will not repeat what harris said 
i may have been to blame i admit it but nothing excuses violence of language and coarseness of expression especially in a man who has been carefully brought up as i know harris has been 
i was thinking of other things and forgot as any one might easily understand that i was steering and the consequence was that we had got mixed up a good deal with the tow path 
it was difficult to say for the moment which was us and which was the middlesex bank of the river but we found out after a while and separated ourselves 
harris however said he had done enough for a bit and proposed that i should take a turn so as we were in i got out and took the tow line and ran the boat on past hampton court 
what a dear old wall that is that runs along by the river there 
i never pass it without feeling better for the sight of it 
such a mellow bright sweet old wall what a charming picture it would make with the lichen creeping here and the moss growing there a shy young vine peeping over the top at this spot to see what is going on upon the busy river and the sober old ivy clustering a little farther down 
there are fifty shades and tints and hues in every ten yards of that old wall 
if i could only draw and knew how to paint i could make a lovely sketch of that old wall i m sure 
i ve often thought i should like to live at hampton court 
it looks so peaceful and so quiet and it is such a dear old place to ramble round in the early morning before many people are about 
but there i don t suppose i should really care for it when it came to actual practice 
it would be so ghastly dull and depressing in the evening when your lamp cast uncanny shadows on the panelled walls and the echo of distant feet rang through the cold stone corridors and now drew nearer and now died away and all was death like silence save the beating of one s own heart 
we are creatures of the sun we men and women 
we love light and life 
that is why we crowd into the towns and cities and the country grows more and more deserted every year 
in the sunlight  in the daytime when nature is alive and busy all around us we like the open hill sides and the deep woods well enough but in the night when our mother earth has gone to sleep and left us waking oh 
the world seems so lonesome and we get frightened like children in a silent house 
then we sit and sob and long for the gas lit streets and the sound of human voices and the answering throb of human life 
we feel so helpless and so little in the great stillness when the dark trees rustle in the night wind 
there are so many ghosts about and their silent sighs make us feel so sad 
let us gather together in the great cities and light huge bonfires of a million gas jets and shout and sing together and feel brave 
 picture people at hampton maze harris asked me if i d ever been in the maze at hampton court 
he said he went in once to show somebody else the way 
he had studied it up in a map and it was so simple that it seemed foolish  hardly worth the twopence charged for admission 
harris said he thought that map must have been got up as a practical joke because it wasn t a bit like the real thing and only misleading 
it was a country cousin that harris took in 
he said  we ll just go in here so that you can say you ve been but it s very simple 
it s absurd to call it a maze 
you keep on taking the first turning to the right 
we ll just walk round for ten minutes and then go and get some lunch  
they met some people soon after they had got inside who said they had been there for three quarters of an hour and had had about enough of it 
harris told them they could follow him if they liked he was just going in and then should turn round and come out again 
they said it was very kind of him and fell behind and followed 
they picked up various other people who wanted to get it over as they went along until they had absorbed all the persons in the maze 
people who had given up all hopes of ever getting either in or out or of ever seeing their home and friends again plucked up courage at the sight of harris and his party and joined the procession blessing him 
harris said he should judge there must have been twenty people following him in all and one woman with a baby who had been there all the morning insisted on taking his arm for fear of losing him 
harris kept on turning to the right but it seemed a long way and his cousin said he supposed it was a very big maze 
 oh one of the largest in europe  said harris 
 yes it must be  replied the cousin because we ve walked a good two miles already  
harris began to think it rather strange himself but he held on until at last they passed the half of a penny bun on the ground that harris s cousin swore he had noticed there seven minutes ago 
harris said oh impossible  
but the woman with the baby said not at all  as she herself had taken it from the child and thrown it down there just before she met harris 
she also added that she wished she never had met harris and expressed an opinion that he was an impostor 
that made harris mad and he produced his map and explained his theory 
 the map may be all right enough  said one of the party if you know whereabouts in it we are now  
harris didn t know and suggested that the best thing to do would be to go back to the entrance and begin again 
for the beginning again part of it there was not much enthusiasm but with regard to the advisability of going back to the entrance there was complete unanimity and so they turned and trailed after harris again in the opposite direction 
about ten minutes more passed and then they found themselves in the centre 
harris thought at first of pretending that that was what he had been aiming at but the crowd looked dangerous and he decided to treat it as an accident 
anyhow they had got something to start from then 
they did know where they were and the map was once more consulted and the thing seemed simpler than ever and off they started for the third time 
and three minutes later they were back in the centre again 
after that they simply couldn t get anywhere else 
whatever way they turned brought them back to the middle 
it became so regular at length that some of the people stopped there and waited for the others to take a walk round and come back to them 
harris drew out his map again after a while but the sight of it only infuriated the mob and they told him to go and curl his hair with it 
harris said that he couldn t help feeling that to a certain extent he had become unpopular 
they all got crazy at last and sang out for the keeper and the man came and climbed up the ladder outside and shouted out directions to them 
but all their heads were by this time in such a confused whirl that they were incapable of grasping anything and so the man told them to stop where they were and he would come to them 
they huddled together and waited and he climbed down and came in 
he was a young keeper as luck would have it and new to the business and when he got in he couldn t find them and he wandered about trying to get to them and then  he  got lost 
they caught sight of him every now and then rushing about the other side of the hedge and he would see them and rush to get to them and they would wait there for about five minutes and then he would reappear again in exactly the same spot and ask them where they had been 
they had to wait till one of the old keepers came back from his dinner before they got out 
harris said he thought it was a very fine maze so far as he was a judge and we agreed that we would try to get george to go into it on our way back

thomas s tomb   the man who loves not graves and coffins and skulls   harris mad   his views on george and banks and lemonade   he performs tricks 
it was while passing through moulsey lock that harris told me about his maze experience 
it took us some time to pass through as we were the only boat and it is a big lock 
i don t think i ever remember to have seen moulsey lock before with only one boat in it 
it is i suppose boulter s not even excepted the busiest lock on the river 
i have stood and watched it sometimes when you could not see any water at all but only a brilliant tangle of bright blazers and gay caps and saucy hats and many coloured parasols and silken rugs and cloaks and streaming ribbons and dainty whites when looking down into the lock from the quay you might fancy it was a huge box into which flowers of every hue and shade had been thrown pell mell and lay piled up in a rainbow heap that covered every corner 
on a fine sunday it presents this appearance nearly all day long while up the stream and down the stream lie waiting their turn outside the gates long lines of still more boats and boats are drawing near and passing away so that the sunny river from the palace up to hampton church is dotted and decked with yellow and blue and orange and white and red and pink 
all the inhabitants of hampton and moulsey dress themselves up in boating costume and come and mouch round the lock with their dogs and flirt and smoke and watch the boats and altogether what with the caps and jackets of the men the pretty coloured dresses of the women the excited dogs the moving boats the white sails the pleasant landscape and the sparkling water it is one of the gayest sights i know of near this dull old london town 
the river affords a good opportunity for dress 
for once in a way we men are able to show  our  taste in colours and i think we come out very natty if you ask me 
i always like a little red in my things  red and black 
you know my hair is a sort of golden brown rather a pretty shade i ve been told and a dark red matches it beautifully and then i always think a light blue necktie goes so well with it and a pair of those russian leather shoes and a red silk handkerchief round the waist  a handkerchief looks so much better than a belt 
harris always keeps to shades or mixtures of orange or yellow but i don t think he is at all wise in this 
his complexion is too dark for yellows 
yellows don t suit him there can be no question about it 
i want him to take to blue as a background with white or cream for relief but there 
the less taste a person has in dress the more obstinate he always seems to be 
it is a great pity because he will never be a success as it is while there are one or two colours in which he might not really look so bad with his hat on 
george has bought some new things for this trip and i m rather vexed about them 
the blazer is loud 
i should not like george to know that i thought so but there really is no other word for it 
he brought it home and showed it to us on thursday evening 
we asked him what colour he called it and he said he didn t know 
he didn t think there was a name for the colour 
the man had told him it was an oriental design 
george put it on and asked us what we thought of it 
harris said that as an object to hang over a flower bed in early spring to frighten the birds away he should respect it but that considered as an article of dress for any human being except a margate nigger it made him ill  george got quite huffy but as harris said if he didn t want his opinion why did he ask for it 
what troubles harris and myself with regard to it is that we are afraid it will attract attention to the boat 
 picture young lady girls also don t look half bad in a boat if prettily dressed 
nothing is more fetching to my thinking than a tasteful boating costume 
but a boating costume  it would be as well if all ladies would understand ought to be a costume that can be worn in a boat and not merely under a glass case 
it utterly spoils an excursion if you have folk in the boat who are thinking all the time a good deal more of their dress than of the trip 
it was my misfortune once to go for a water picnic with two ladies of this kind 
we did have a lively time 
they were both beautifully got up  all lace and silky stuff and flowers and ribbons and dainty shoes and light gloves 
but they were dressed for a photographic studio not for a river picnic 
they were the boating costumes of a french fashion plate 
it was ridiculous fooling about in them anywhere near real earth air and water 
the first thing was that they thought the boat was not clean 
we dusted all the seats for them and then assured them that it was but they didn t believe us 
one of them rubbed the cushion with the forefinger of her glove and showed the result to the other and they both sighed and sat down with the air of early christian martyrs trying to make themselves comfortable up against the stake 
you are liable to occasionally splash a little when sculling and it appeared that a drop of water ruined those costumes 
the mark never came out and a stain was left on the dress for ever 
i was stroke 
i did my best 
i feathered some two feet high and i paused at the end of each stroke to let the blades drip before returning them and i picked out a smooth bit of water to drop them into again each time 
 bow said after a while that he did not feel himself a sufficiently accomplished oarsman to pull with me but that he would sit still if i would allow him and study my stroke 
he said it interested him  
but notwithstanding all this and try as i would i could not help an occasional flicker of water from going over those dresses 
the girls did not complain but they huddled up close together and set their lips firm and every time a drop touched them they visibly shrank and shuddered 
it was a noble sight to see them suffering thus in silence but it unnerved me altogether 
i am too sensitive 
i got wild and fitful in my rowing and splashed more and more the harder i tried not to 
i gave it up at last i said i d row bow 
bow thought the arrangement would be better too and we changed places 
the ladies gave an involuntary sigh of relief when they saw me go and quite brightened up for a moment 
poor girls 
they had better have put up with me 
the man they had got now was a jolly light hearted thick headed sort of a chap with about as much sensitiveness in him as there might be in a newfoundland puppy 
you might look daggers at him for an hour and he would not notice it and it would not trouble him if he did 
he set a good rollicking dashing stroke that sent the spray playing all over the boat like a fountain and made the whole crowd sit up straight in no time 
when he spread more than pint of water over one of those dresses he would give a pleasant little laugh and say  i beg your pardon i m sure  and offer them his handkerchief to wipe it off with 
 oh it s of no consequence  the poor girls would murmur in reply and covertly draw rugs and coats over themselves and try and protect themselves with their lace parasols 
at lunch they had a very bad time of it 
people wanted them to sit on the grass and the grass was dusty and the tree trunks against which they were invited to lean did not appear to have been brushed for weeks so they spread their handkerchiefs on the ground and sat on those bolt upright 
somebody in walking about with a plate of beef steak pie tripped up over a root and sent the pie flying 
none of it went over them fortunately but the accident suggested a fresh danger to them and agitated them and whenever anybody moved about after that with anything in his hand that could fall and make a mess they watched that person with growing anxiety until he sat down again 
 picture washing up  now then you girls  said our friend bow to them cheerily after it was all over come along you ve got to wash up  
they didn t understand him at first 
when they grasped the idea they said they feared they did not know how to wash up 
 oh i ll soon show you  he cried it s rare fun 
you lie down on your  i mean you lean over the bank you know and sloush the things about in the water  
the elder sister said that she was afraid that they hadn t got on dresses suited to the work 
 oh they ll be all right  said he light heartedly tuck em up  
and he made them do it too 
he told them that that sort of thing was half the fun of a picnic 
they said it was very interesting 
now i come to think it over was that young man as dense headed as we thought 
or was he  no impossible 
there was such a simple child like expression about him 
harris wanted to get out at hampton church to go and see mrs thomas s tomb 
 who is mrs 
thomas  
i asked 
 how should i know  
replied harris 
 she s a lady that s got a funny tomb and i want to see it  
i objected 
i don t know whether it is that i am built wrong but i never did seem to hanker after tombstones myself 
i know that the proper thing to do when you get to a village or town is to rush off to the churchyard and enjoy the graves but it is a recreation that i always deny myself 
i take no interest in creeping round dim and chilly churches behind wheezy old men and reading epitaphs 
not even the sight of a bit of cracked brass let into a stone affords me what i call real happiness 
i shock respectable sextons by the imperturbability i am able to assume before exciting inscriptions and by my lack of enthusiasm for the local family history while my ill concealed anxiety to get outside wounds their feelings 
one golden morning of a sunny day i leant against the low stone wall that guarded a little village church and i smoked and drank in deep calm gladness from the sweet restful scene  the grey old church with its clustering ivy and its quaint carved wooden porch the white lane winding down the hill between tall rows of elms the thatched roof cottages peeping above their trim kept hedges the silver river in the hollow the wooded hills beyond 
it was a lovely landscape 
it was idyllic poetical and it inspired me 
i felt good and noble 
i felt i didn t want to be sinful and wicked any more 
i would come and live here and never do any more wrong and lead a blameless beautiful life and have silver hair when i got old and all that sort of thing 
in that moment i forgave all my friends and relations for their wickedness and cussedness and i blessed them 
they did not know that i blessed them 
they went their abandoned way all unconscious of what i far away in that peaceful village was doing for them but i did it and i wished that i could let them know that i had done it because i wanted to make them happy 
i was going on thinking away all these grand tender thoughts when my reverie was broken in upon by a shrill piping voice crying out  all right sur i m a coming i m a coming 
it s all right sur don t you be in a hurry  
i looked up and saw an old bald headed man hobbling across the churchyard towards me carrying a huge bunch of keys in his hand that shook and jingled at every step 
i motioned him away with silent dignity but he still advanced screeching out the while  i m a coming sur i m a coming 
i m a little lame 
i ain t as spry as i used to be 
this way sur  
 go away you miserable old man  i said 
 i ve come as soon as i could sur  he replied 
 my missis never see you till just this minute 
you follow me sur  
 go away  i repeated leave me before i get over the wall and slay you  
he seemed surprised 
 don t you want to see the tombs  
he said 
 no  i answered i don t 
i want to stop here leaning up against this gritty old wall 
go away and don t disturb me 
i am chock full of beautiful and noble thoughts and i want to stop like it because it feels nice and good 
don t you come fooling about making me mad chivying away all my better feelings with this silly tombstone nonsense of yours 
go away and get somebody to bury you cheap and i ll pay half the expense  
he was bewildered for a moment 
he rubbed his eyes and looked hard at me 
i seemed human enough on the outside he couldn t make it out 
he said  yuise a stranger in these parts 
you don t live here  
 picture graves no  i said i don t 
you  wouldn t if  i  did  
 well then  he said you want to see the tombs  graves  folks been buried you know  coffins  
 you are an untruther  i replied getting roused i do not want to see tombs  not your tombs 
why should i 
we have graves of our own our family has 
why my uncle podger has a tomb in kensal green cemetery that is the pride of all that country side and my grandfather s vault at bow is capable of accommodating eight visitors while my great aunt susan has a brick grave in finchley churchyard with a headstone with a coffee pot sort of thing in bas relief upon it and a six inch best white stone coping all the way round that cost pounds 
when i want graves it is to those places that i go and revel 
i do not want other folk s 
when you yourself are buried i will come and see yours 
that is all i can do for you  
he burst into tears 
he said that one of the tombs had a bit of stone upon the top of it that had been said by some to be probably part of the remains of the figure of a man and that another had some words carved upon it that nobody had ever been able to decipher 
i still remained obdurate and in broken hearted tones he said  well won t you come and see the memorial window  
i would not even see that so he fired his last shot 
he drew near and whispered hoarsely  i ve got a couple of skulls down in the crypt  he said come and see those 
oh do come and see the skulls 
you are a young man out for a holiday and you want to enjoy yourself 
come and see the skulls  
then i turned and fled and as i sped i heard him calling to me  oh come and see the skulls come back and see the skulls  
harris however revels in tombs and graves and epitaphs and monumental inscriptions and the thought of not seeing mrs thomas s grave made him crazy 
he said he had looked forward to seeing mrs thomas s grave from the first moment that the trip was proposed  said he wouldn t have joined if it hadn t been for the idea of seeing mrs thomas s tomb 
i reminded him of george and how we had to get the boat up to shepperton by five o clock to meet him and then he went for george 
why was george to fool about all day and leave us to lug this lumbering old top heavy barge up and down the river by ourselves to meet him 
why couldn t george come and do some work 
why couldn t he have got the day off and come down with us 
bank be blowed 
what good was he at the bank 
 i never see him doing any work there  continued harris whenever i go in 
he sits behind a bit of glass all day trying to look as if he was doing something 
what s the good of a man behind a bit of glass 
i have to work for my living 
why can t he work 
what use is he there and what s the good of their banks 
they take your money and then when you draw a cheque they send it back smeared all over with no effects  refer to drawer  
what s the good of that 
that s the sort of trick they served me twice last week 
i m not going to stand it much longer 
i shall withdraw my account 
if he was here we could go and see that tomb 
i don t believe he s at the bank at all 
he s larking about somewhere that s what he s doing leaving us to do all the work 
i m going to get out and have a drink  
i pointed out to him that we were miles away from a pub 
 and then he went on about the river and what was the good of the river and was everyone who came on the river to die of thirst 
it is always best to let harris have his head when he gets like this 
then he pumps himself out and is quiet afterwards 
i reminded him that there was concentrated lemonade in the hamper and a gallon jar of water in the nose of the boat and that the two only wanted mixing to make a cool and refreshing beverage 
then he flew off about lemonade and such like sunday school slops  as he termed them ginger beer raspberry syrup c  c  he said they all produced dyspepsia and ruined body and soul alike and were the cause of half the crime in england 
he said he must drink something however and climbed upon the seat and leant over to get the bottle 
it was right at the bottom of the hamper and seemed difficult to find and he had to lean over further and further and in trying to steer at the same time from a topsy turvy point of view he pulled the wrong line and sent the boat into the bank and the shock upset him and he dived down right into the hamper and stood there on his head holding on to the sides of the boat like grim death his legs sticking up into the air 
he dared not move for fear of going over and had to stay there till i could get hold of his legs and haul him back and that made him madder than ever 
chapter viii 
blackmailing   the proper course to pursue   selfish boorishness of river side landowner    notice boards   unchristianlike feelings of harris   how harris sings a comic song   a high class party   shameful conduct of two abandoned young men   some useless information   george buys a banjo 
we stopped under the willows by kempton park and lunched 
it is a pretty little spot there a pleasant grass plateau running along by the water s edge and overhung by willows 
we had just commenced the third course  the bread and jam  when a gentleman in shirt sleeves and a short pipe came along and wanted to know if we knew that we were trespassing 
we said we hadn t given the matter sufficient consideration as yet to enable us to arrive at a definite conclusion on that point but that if he assured us on his word as a gentleman that we  were  trespassing we would without further hesitation believe it 
he gave us the required assurance and we thanked him but he still hung about and seemed to be dissatisfied so we asked him if there was anything further that we could do for him and harris who is of a chummy disposition offered him a bit of bread and jam 
i fancy he must have belonged to some society sworn to abstain from bread and jam for he declined it quite gruffly as if he were vexed at being tempted with it and he added that it was his duty to turn us off 
harris said that if it was a duty it ought to be done and asked the man what was his idea with regard to the best means for accomplishing it 
harris is what you would call a well made man of about number one size and looks hard and bony and the man measured him up and down and said he would go and consult his master and then come back and chuck us both into the river 
of course we never saw him any more and of course all he really wanted was a shilling 
there are a certain number of riverside roughs who make quite an income during the summer by slouching about the banks and blackmailing weak minded noodles in this way 
they represent themselves as sent by the proprietor 
the proper course to pursue is to offer your name and address and leave the owner if he really has anything to do with the matter to summon you and prove what damage you have done to his land by sitting down on a bit of it 
but the majority of people are so intensely lazy and timid that they prefer to encourage the imposition by giving in to it rather than put an end to it by the exertion of a little firmness 
where it is really the owners that are to blame they ought to be shown up 
the selfishness of the riparian proprietor grows with every year 
if these men had their way they would close the river thames altogether 
they actually do this along the minor tributary streams and in the backwaters 
they drive posts into the bed of the stream and draw chains across from bank to bank and nail huge notice boards on every tree 
the sight of those notice boards rouses every evil instinct in my nature 
i feel i want to tear each one down and hammer it over the head of the man who put it up until i have killed him and then i would bury him and put the board up over the grave as a tombstone 
i mentioned these feelings of mine to harris and he said he had them worse than that 
he said he not only felt he wanted to kill the man who caused the board to be put up but that he should like to slaughter the whole of his family and all his friends and relations and then burn down his house 
this seemed to me to be going too far and i said so to harris but he answered  not a bit of it 
serve em all jolly well right and i d go and sing comic songs on the ruins  
i was vexed to hear harris go on in this blood thirsty strain 
we never ought to allow our instincts of justice to degenerate into mere vindictiveness 
it was a long while before i could get harris to take a more christian view of the subject but i succeeded at last and he promised me that he would spare the friends and relations at all events and would not sing comic songs on the ruins 
you have never heard harris sing a comic song or you would understand the service i had rendered to mankind 
it is one of harris s fixed ideas that he  can  sing a comic song the fixed idea on the contrary among those of harris s friends who have heard him try is that he  can t  and never will be able to and that he ought not to be allowed to try 
when harris is at a party and is asked to sing he replies well i can only sing a  comic  song you know  and he says it in a tone that implies that his singing of  that  however is a thing that you ought to hear once and then die 
 oh that  is  nice  says the hostess 
 do sing one mr harris  and harris gets up and makes for the piano with the beaming cheeriness of a generous minded man who is just about to give somebody something 
 now silence please everybody says the hostess turning round mr harris is going to sing a comic song  
 oh how jolly  
they murmur and they hurry in from the conservatory and come up from the stairs and go and fetch each other from all over the house and crowd into the drawing room and sit round all smirking in anticipation 
then harris begins 
well you don t look for much of a voice in a comic song 
you don t expect correct phrasing or vocalization 
you don t mind if a man does find out when in the middle of a note that he is too high and comes down with a jerk 
you don t bother about time 
you don t mind a man being two bars in front of the accompaniment and easing up in the middle of a line to argue it out with the pianist and then starting the verse afresh 
but you do expect the words 
you don t expect a man to never remember more than the first three lines of the first verse and to keep on repeating these until it is time to begin the chorus 
you don t expect a man to break off in the middle of a line and snigger and say it s very funny but he s blest if he can think of the rest of it and then try and make it up for himself and afterwards suddenly recollect it when he has got to an entirely different part of the song and break off without a word of warning to go back and let you have it then and there 
you don t  well i will just give you an idea of harris s comic singing and then you can judge of it for yourself 
 picture harris harris  standing up in front of piano and addressing the expectant mob  i m afraid it s a very old thing you know 
i expect you all know it you know 
but it s the only thing i know 
it s the judge s song out of  pinafore  no i don t mean  pinafore  i mean  you know what i mean  the other thing you know 
you must all join in the chorus you know  
 murmurs of delight and anxiety to join in the chorus 
brilliant performance of prelude to the judge s song in   trial by jury   by nervous pianist 
moment arrives for harris to join in 
harris takes no notice of it 
nervous pianist commences prelude over again and harris   commencing singing at the same time   dashes off the first two lines of the first lord s song out of   pinafore  
nervous pianist tries to push on with prelude   gives it up   and tries to follow harris with accompaniment to judge s song out of   trial by jury   finds that doesn t answer   and tries to recollect what he is doing   and where he is   feels his mind giving way   and stops short  
harris  with kindly encouragement  it s all right 
you re doing it very well indeed  go on  
nervous pianist i m afraid there s a mistake somewhere 
what are you singing  
harris  promptly  why the judge s song out of trial by jury 
don t you know it  
some friend of harris s  from the back of the room  no you re not you chuckle head you re singing the admiral s song from  pinafore  
 long argument between harris and harris s friend as to what harris is really singing 
friend finally suggests that it doesn t matter what harris is singing so long as harris gets on and sings it   and harris  with an evident sense of injustice rankling inside him   requests pianist to begin again 
pianist   thereupon   starts prelude to the admiral s song   and harris   seizing what he considers to be a favourable opening in the music   begins  
harris   when i was young and called to the bar   
 general roar of laughter   taken by harris as a compliment 
pianist   thinking of his wife and family   gives up the unequal contest and retires   his place being taken by a stronger nerved man 
the new pianist  cheerily  now then old man you start off and i ll follow 
we won t bother about any prelude  
harris  upon whom the explanation of matters has slowly dawned  laughing  by jove 
i beg your pardon 
of course  i ve been mixing up the two songs 
it was jenkins confused me you know 
now then 
 singing   his voice appearing to come from the cellar   and suggesting the first low warnings of an approaching earthquake 
  when i was young i served a term as office boy to an attorney s firm  
 aside to pianist  it is too low old man we ll have that over again if you don t mind  
 sings first two lines over again   in a high falsetto this time 
great surprise on the part of the audience 
nervous old lady near the fire begins to cry   and has to be led out  
harris  continuing    i swept the windows and i swept the door and i    no  no i cleaned the windows of the big front door 
and i polished up the floor  no dash it  i beg your pardon  funny thing i can t think of that line 
and i  and i  oh well we ll get on to the chorus and chance it  sings    and i diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle de till now i am the ruler of the queen s navee  
now then chorus  it is the last two lines repeated you know 
general chorus  and he diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle dee d till now he is the ruler of the queen s navee  
and harris never sees what an ass he is making of himself and how he is annoying a lot of people who never did him any harm 
he honestly imagines that he has given them a treat and says he will sing another comic song after supper 
speaking of comic songs and parties reminds me of a rather curious incident at which i once assisted which as it throws much light upon the inner mental working of human nature in general ought i think to be recorded in these pages 
we were a fashionable and highly cultured party 
we had on our best clothes and we talked pretty and were very happy  all except two young fellows students just returned from germany commonplace young men who seemed restless and uncomfortable as if they found the proceedings slow 
the truth was we were too clever for them 
our brilliant but polished conversation and our high class tastes were beyond them 
they were out of place among us 
they never ought to have been there at all 
everybody agreed upon that later on 
we played  morceaux  from the old german masters 
we discussed philosophy and ethics 
we flirted with graceful dignity 
we were even humorous  in a high class way 
somebody recited a french poem after supper and we said it was beautiful and then a lady sang a sentimental ballad in spanish and it made one or two of us weep  it was so pathetic 
and then those two young men got up and asked us if we had ever heard herr slossenn boschen who had just arrived and was then down in the supper room sing his great german comic song 
none of us had heard it that we could remember 
the young men said it was the funniest song that had ever been written and that if we liked they would get herr slossenn boschen whom they knew very well to sing it 
they said it was so funny that when herr slossenn boschen had sung it once before the german emperor he the german emperor had had to be carried off to bed 
they said nobody could sing it like herr slossenn boschen he was so intensely serious all through it that you might fancy he was reciting a tragedy and that of course made it all the funnier 
they said he never once suggested by his tone or manner that he was singing anything funny  that would spoil it 
it was his air of seriousness almost of pathos that made it so irresistibly amusing 
we said we yearned to hear it that we wanted a good laugh and they went downstairs and fetched herr slossenn boschen 
he appeared to be quite pleased to sing it for he came up at once and sat down to the piano without another word 
 oh it will amuse you 
you will laugh  whispered the two young men as they passed through the room and took up an unobtrusive position behind the professor s back 
herr slossenn boschen accompanied himself 
the prelude did not suggest a comic song exactly 
it was a weird soulful air 
it quite made one s flesh creep but we murmured to one another that it was the german method and prepared to enjoy it 
i don t understand german myself 
i learned it at school but forgot every word of it two years after i had left and have felt much better ever since 
still i did not want the people there to guess my ignorance so i hit upon what i thought to be rather a good idea 
i kept my eye on the two young students and followed them 
when they tittered i tittered when they roared i roared and i also threw in a little snigger all by myself now and then as if i had seen a bit of humour that had escaped the others 
i considered this particularly artful on my part 
i noticed as the song progressed that a good many other people seemed to have their eye fixed on the two young men as well as myself 
these other people also tittered when the young men tittered and roared when the young men roared and as the two young men tittered and roared and exploded with laughter pretty continuously all through the song it went exceedingly well 
and yet that german professor did not seem happy 
at first when we began to laugh the expression of his face was one of intense surprise as if laughter were the very last thing he had expected to be greeted with 
we thought this very funny we said his earnest manner was half the humour 
the slightest hint on his part that he knew how funny he was would have completely ruined it all 
as we continued to laugh his surprise gave way to an air of annoyance and indignation and he scowled fiercely round upon us all except upon the two young men who being behind him he could not see  
that sent us into convulsions 
we told each other that it would be the death of us this thing 
the words alone we said were enough to send us into fits but added to his mock seriousness  oh it was too much 
in the last verse he surpassed himself 
he glowered round upon us with a look of such concentrated ferocity that but for our being forewarned as to the german method of comic singing we should have been nervous and he threw such a wailing note of agony into the weird music that if we had not known it was a funny song we might have wept 
he finished amid a perfect shriek of laughter 
we said it was the funniest thing we had ever heard in all our lives 
we said how strange it was that in the face of things like these there should be a popular notion that the germans hadn t any sense of humour 
and we asked the professor why he didn t translate the song into english so that the common people could understand it and hear what a real comic song was like 
then herr slossenn boschen got up and went on awful 
he swore at us in german which i should judge to be a singularly effective language for that purpose  and he danced and shook his fists and called us all the english he knew 
he said he had never been so insulted in all his life 
it appeared that the song was not a comic song at all 
it was about a young girl who lived in the hartz mountains and who had given up her life to save her lover s soul and he died and met her spirit in the air and then in the last verse he jilted her spirit and went on with another spirit  i m not quite sure of the details but it was something very sad i know 
herr boschen said he had sung it once before the german emperor and he the german emperor had sobbed like a little child 
he herr boschen said it was generally acknowledged to be one of the most tragic and pathetic songs in the german language 
it was a trying situation for us  very trying 
there seemed to be no answer 
we looked around for the two young men who had done this thing but they had left the house in an unostentatious manner immediately after the end of the song 
that was the end of that party 
i never saw a party break up so quietly and with so little fuss 
we never said good night even to one another 
we came downstairs one at a time walking softly and keeping the shady side 
we asked the servant for our hats and coats in whispers and opened the door for ourselves and slipped out and got round the corner quickly avoiding each other as much as possible 
i have never taken much interest in german songs since then 
we reached sunbury lock at half past three 
the river is sweetly pretty just there before you come to the gates and the backwater is charming but don t attempt to row up it 
i tried to do so once 
i was sculling and asked the fellows who were steering if they thought it could be done and they said oh yes they thought so if i pulled hard 
we were just under the little foot bridge that crosses it between the two weirs when they said this and i bent down over the sculls and set myself up and pulled 
i pulled splendidly 
i got well into a steady rhythmical swing 
i put my arms and my legs and my back into it 
i set myself a good quick dashing stroke and worked in really grand style 
my two friends said it was a pleasure to watch me 
at the end of five minutes i thought we ought to be pretty near the weir and i looked up 
we were under the bridge in exactly the same spot that we were when i began and there were those two idiots injuring themselves by violent laughing 
i had been grinding away like mad to keep that boat stuck still under that bridge 
i let other people pull up backwaters against strong streams now 
we sculled up to walton a rather large place for a riverside town 
as with all riverside places only the tiniest corner of it comes down to the water so that from the boat you might fancy it was a village of some half dozen houses all told 
windsor and abingdon are the only towns between london and oxford that you can really see anything of from the stream 
all the others hide round corners and merely peep at the river down one street my thanks to them for being so considerate and leaving the river banks to woods and fields and water works 
even reading though it does its best to spoil and sully and make hideous as much of the river as it can reach is good natured enough to keep its ugly face a good deal out of sight 
caesar of course had a little place at walton  a camp or an entrenchment or something of that sort 
caesar was a regular up river man 
also queen elizabeth she was there too 
you can never get away from that woman go where you will 
cromwell and bradshaw not the guide man but the king charles s head man likewise sojourned here 
they must have been quite a pleasant little party altogether 
there is an iron scold s bridle in walton church 
they used these things in ancient days for curbing women s tongues 
they have given up the attempt now 
i suppose iron was getting scarce and nothing else would be strong enough 
there are also tombs of note in the church and i was afraid i should never get harris past them but he didn t seem to think of them and we went on 
above the bridge the river winds tremendously 
this makes it look picturesque but it irritates you from a towing or sculling point of view and causes argument between the man who is pulling and the man who is steering 
you pass oatlands park on the right bank here 
it is a famous old place 
henry viii 
stole it from some one or the other i forget whom now and lived in it 
there is a grotto in the park which you can see for a fee and which is supposed to be very wonderful but i cannot see much in it myself 
the late duchess of york who lived at oatlands was very fond of dogs and kept an immense number 
she had a special graveyard made in which to bury them when they died and there they lie about fifty of them with a tombstone over each and an epitaph inscribed thereon 
well i dare say they deserve it quite as much as the average christian does 
at corway stakes   the first bend above walton bridge  was fought a battle between caesar and cassivelaunus 
cassivelaunus had prepared the river for caesar by planting it full of stakes and had no doubt put up a notice board  
but caesar crossed in spite of this 
you couldn t choke caesar off that river 
he is the sort of man we want round the backwaters now 
halliford and shepperton are both pretty little spots where they touch the river but there is nothing remarkable about either of them 
there is a tomb in shepperton churchyard however with a poem on it and i was nervous lest harris should want to get out and fool round it 
i saw him fix a longing eye on the landing stage as we drew near it so i managed by an adroit movement to jerk his cap into the water and in the excitement of recovering that and his indignation at my clumsiness he forgot all about his beloved graves 
at weybridge the wey a pretty little stream navigable for small boats up to guildford and one which i have always been making up my mind to explore and never have  the bourne and the basingstoke canal all enter the thames together 
the lock is just opposite the town and the first thing that we saw when we came in view of it was george s blazer on one of the lock gates closer inspection showing that george was inside it 
montmorency set up a furious barking i shrieked harris roared george waved his hat and yelled back 
the lock keeper rushed out with a drag under the impression that somebody had fallen into the lock and appeared annoyed at finding that no one had 
george had rather a curious oilskin covered parcel in his hand 
it was round and flat at one end with a long straight handle sticking out of it 
 what s that  
said harris   a frying pan  
 no  said george with a strange wild look glittering in his eyes they are all the rage this season everybody has got them up the river 
it s a banjo  
 i never knew you played the banjo  
cried harris and i in one breath 
 not exactly  replied george but it s very easy they tell me and i ve got the instruction book  
 picture george and the banjo     chapter ix 
george is introduced to work   heathenish instincts of tow lines   ungrateful conduct of a double sculling skiff   towers and towed   a use discovered for lovers   strange disappearance of an elderly lady   much haste less speed   being towed by girls exciting sensation   the missing lock or the haunted river   music   saved 
we made george work now we had got him 
he did not want to work of course that goes without saying 
he had had a hard time in the city so he explained 
harris who is callous in his nature and not prone to pity said  ah 
and now you are going to have a hard time on the river for a change change is good for everyone 
out you get  
he could not in conscience  not even george s conscience  object though he did suggest that perhaps it would be better for him to stop in the boat and get tea ready while harris and i towed because getting tea was such a worrying work and harris and i looked tired 
the only reply we made to this however was to pass him over the tow line and he took it and stepped out 
 picture dog wrapped in tow line there is something very strange and unaccountable about a tow line 
you roll it up with as much patience and care as you would take to fold up a new pair of trousers and five minutes afterwards when you pick it up it is one ghastly soul revolting tangle 
i do not wish to be insulting but i firmly believe that if you took an average tow line and stretched it out straight across the middle of a field and then turned your back on it for thirty seconds that when you looked round again you would find that it had got itself altogether in a heap in the middle of the field and had twisted itself up and tied itself into knots and lost its two ends and become all loops and it would take you a good half hour sitting down there on the grass and swearing all the while to disentangle it again 
that is my opinion of tow lines in general 
of course there may be honourable exceptions i do not say that there are not 
there may be tow lines that are a credit to their profession  conscientious respectable tow lines  tow lines that do not imagine they are crochet work and try to knit themselves up into antimacassars the instant they are left to themselves 
i say there  may  be such tow lines i sincerely hope there are 
but i have not met with them 
this tow line i had taken in myself just before we had got to the lock 
i would not let harris touch it because he is careless 
i had looped it round slowly and cautiously and tied it up in the middle and folded it in two and laid it down gently at the bottom of the boat 
harris had lifted it up scientifically and had put it into george s hand 
george had taken it firmly and held it away from him and had begun to unravel it as if he were taking the swaddling clothes off a new born infant and before he had unwound a dozen yards the thing was more like a badly made door mat than anything else 
it is always the same and the same sort of thing always goes on in connection with it 
the man on the bank who is trying to disentangle it thinks all the fault lies with the man who rolled it up and when a man up the river thinks a thing he says it 
 what have you been trying to do with it make a fishing net of it 
you ve made a nice mess you have why couldn t you wind it up properly you silly dummy  
he grunts from time to time as he struggles wildly with it and lays it out flat on the tow path and runs round and round it trying to find the end 
on the other hand the man who wound it up thinks the whole cause of the muddle rests with the man who is trying to unwind it 
 it was all right when you took it  
he exclaims indignantly 
 why don t you think what you are doing 
you go about things in such a slap dash style 
you d get a scaffolding pole entangled  you  would  
and they feel so angry with one another that they would like to hang each other with the thing 
ten minutes go by and the first man gives a yell and goes mad and dances on the rope and tries to pull it straight by seizing hold of the first piece that comes to his hand and hauling at it 
of course this only gets it into a tighter tangle than ever 
then the second man climbs out of the boat and comes to help him and they get in each other s way and hinder one another 
they both get hold of the same bit of line and pull at it in opposite directions and wonder where it is caught 
in the end they do get it clear and then turn round and find that the boat has drifted off and is making straight for the weir 
this really happened once to my own knowledge 
it was up by boveney one rather windy morning 
we were pulling down stream and as we came round the bend we noticed a couple of men on the bank 
they were looking at each other with as bewildered and helplessly miserable expression as i have ever witnessed on any human countenance before or since and they held a long tow line between them 
it was clear that something had happened so we eased up and asked them what was the matter 
 why our boat s gone off  
they replied in an indignant tone 
 we just got out to disentangle the tow line and when we looked round it was gone  
and they seemed hurt at what they evidently regarded as a mean and ungrateful act on the part of the boat 
we found the truant for them half a mile further down held by some rushes and we brought it back to them 
i bet they did not give that boat another chance for a week 
i shall never forget the picture of those two men walking up and down the bank with a tow line looking for their boat 
one sees a good many funny incidents up the river in connection with towing 
one of the most common is the sight of a couple of towers walking briskly along deep in an animated discussion while the man in the boat a hundred yards behind them is vainly shrieking to them to stop and making frantic signs of distress with a scull 
something has gone wrong the rudder has come off or the boat hook has slipped overboard or his hat has dropped into the water and is floating rapidly down stream 
he calls to them to stop quite gently and politely at first 
 picture hat in the water hi 
stop a minute will you  
he shouts cheerily 
 i ve dropped my hat over board  
then hi 
tom  dick 
can t you hear  
not quite so affably this time 
then hi 
confound  you  you dunder headed idiots 
hi 
stop 
oh you    
after that he springs up and dances about and roars himself red in the face and curses everything he knows 
and the small boys on the bank stop and jeer at him and pitch stones at him as he is pulled along past them at the rate of four miles an hour and can t get out 
much of this sort of trouble would be saved if those who are towing would keep remembering that they are towing and give a pretty frequent look round to see how their man is getting on 
it is best to let one person tow 
when two are doing it they get chattering and forget and the boat itself offering as it does but little resistance is of no real service in reminding them of the fact 
as an example of how utterly oblivious a pair of towers can be to their work george told us later on in the evening when we were discussing the subject after supper of a very curious instance 
 picture two people towing boat adrift  he and three other men so he said were sculling a very heavily laden boat up from maidenhead one evening and a little above cookham lock they noticed a fellow and a girl walking along the towpath both deep in an apparently interesting and absorbing conversation 
they were carrying a boat hook between them and attached to the boat hook was a tow line which trailed behind them its end in the water 
no boat was near no boat was in sight 
there must have been a boat attached to that tow line at some time or other that was certain but what had become of it what ghastly fate had overtaken it and those who had been left in it was buried in mystery 
whatever the accident may have been however it had in no way disturbed the young lady and gentleman who were towing 
they had the boat hook and they had the line and that seemed to be all that they thought necessary to their work 
george was about to call out and wake them up but at that moment a bright idea flashed across him and he didn t 
he got the hitcher instead and reached over and drew in the end of the tow line and they made a loop in it and put it over their mast and then they tidied up the sculls and went and sat down in the stern and lit their pipes 
and that young man and young woman towed those four hulking chaps and a heavy boat up to marlow 
george said he never saw so much thoughtful sadness concentrated into one glance before as when at the lock that young couple grasped the idea that for the last two miles they had been towing the wrong boat 
george fancied that if it had not been for the restraining influence of the sweet woman at his side the young man might have given way to violent language 
the maiden was the first to recover from her surprise and when she did she clasped her hands and said wildly  oh henry then  where  is auntie  
 did they ever recover the old lady  
asked harris 
george replied he did not know 
another example of the dangerous want of sympathy between tower and towed was witnessed by george and myself once up near walton 
it was where the tow path shelves gently down into the water and we were camping on the opposite bank noticing things in general 
by and by a small boat came in sight towed through the water at a tremendous pace by a powerful barge horse on which sat a very small boy 
scattered about the boat in dreamy and reposeful attitudes lay five fellows the man who was steering having a particularly restful appearance 
 i should like to see him pull the wrong line  murmured george as they passed 
and at that precise moment the man did it and the boat rushed up the bank with a noise like the ripping up of forty thousand linen sheets 
two men a hamper and three oars immediately left the boat on the larboard side and reclined on the bank and one and a half moments afterwards two other men disembarked from the starboard and sat down among boat hooks and sails and carpet bags and bottles 
the last man went on twenty yards further and then got out on his head 
this seemed to sort of lighten the boat and it went on much easier the small boy shouting at the top of his voice and urging his steed into a gallop 
the fellows sat up and stared at one another 
it was some seconds before they realised what had happened to them but when they did they began to shout lustily for the boy to stop 
he however was too much occupied with the horse to hear them and we watched them flying after him until the distance hid them from view 
i cannot say i was sorry at their mishap 
indeed i only wish that all the young fools who have their boats towed in this fashion  and plenty do  could meet with similar misfortunes 
besides the risk they run themselves they become a danger and an annoyance to every other boat they pass 
going at the pace they do it is impossible for them to get out of anybody else s way or for anybody else to get out of theirs 
their line gets hitched across your mast and overturns you or it catches somebody in the boat and either throws them into the water or cuts their face open 
the best plan is to stand your ground and be prepared to keep them off with the butt end of a mast 
of all experiences in connection with towing the most exciting is being towed by girls 
it is a sensation that nobody ought to miss 
it takes three girls to tow always two hold the rope and the other one runs round and round and giggles 
they generally begin by getting themselves tied up 
they get the line round their legs and have to sit down on the path and undo each other and then they twist it round their necks and are nearly strangled 
they fix it straight however at last and start off at a run pulling the boat along at quite a dangerous pace 
at the end of a hundred yards they are naturally breathless and suddenly stop and all sit down on the grass and laugh and your boat drifts out to mid stream and turns round before you know what has happened or can get hold of a scull 
then they stand up and are surprised 
 oh look  
they say he s gone right out into the middle  
 picture lady pinning up frock they pull on pretty steadily for a bit after this and then it all at once occurs to one of them that she will pin up her frock and they ease up for the purpose and the boat runs aground 
you jump up and push it off and you shout to them not to stop 
 yes 
what s the matter  
they shout back 
 don t stop  you roar 
 don t what  
 don t stop  go on  go on  
 go back emily and see what it is they want  says one and emily comes back and asks what it is 
 what do you want  
she says anything happened  
 no  you reply it s all right only go on you know  don t stop  
 why not  
 why we can t steer if you keep stopping 
you must keep some way on the boat  
 keep some what  
 some way  you must keep the boat moving  
 oh all right i ll tell em 
are we doing it all right  
 oh yes very nicely indeed only don t stop  
 it doesn t seem difficult at all 
i thought it was so hard  
 oh no it s simple enough 
you want to keep on steady at it that s all  
 i see 
give me out my red shawl it s under the cushion  
you find the shawl and hand it out and by this time another one has come back and thinks she will have hers too and they take mary s on chance and mary does not want it so they bring it back and have a pocket comb instead 
it is about twenty minutes before they get off again and at the next corner they see a cow and you have to leave the boat to chivy the cow out of their way 
there is never a dull moment in the boat while girls are towing it 
george got the line right after a while and towed us steadily on to penton hook 
there we discussed the important question of camping 
we had decided to sleep on board that night and we had either to lay up just about there or go on past staines 
it seemed early to think about shutting up then however with the sun still in the heavens and we settled to push straight on for runnymead three and a half miles further a quiet wooded part of the river and where there is good shelter 
we all wished however afterward that we had stopped at penton hook 
three or four miles up stream is a trifle early in the morning but it is a weary pull at the end of a long day 
you take no interest in the scenery during these last few miles 
you do not chat and laugh 
every half mile you cover seems like two 
you can hardly believe you are only where you are and you are convinced that the map must be wrong and when you have trudged along for what seems to you at least ten miles and still the lock is not in sight you begin to seriously fear that somebody must have sneaked it and run off with it 
i remember being terribly upset once up the river in a figurative sense i mean  
i was out with a young lady  cousin on my mother s side  and we were pulling down to goring 
it was rather late and we were anxious to get in  at least  she  was anxious to get in 
it was half past six when we reached benson s lock and dusk was drawing on and she began to get excited then 
she said she must be in to supper 
i said it was a thing i felt i wanted to be in at too and i drew out a map i had with me to see exactly how far it was 
i saw it was just a mile and a half to the next lock  wallingford  and five on from there to cleeve 
 oh it s all right  
i said 
 we ll be through the next lock before seven and then there is only one more  and i settled down and pulled steadily away 
we passed the bridge and soon after that i asked if she saw the lock 
she said no she did not see any lock and i said oh  
and pulled on 
another five minutes went by and then i asked her to look again 
 no  she said i can t see any signs of a lock  
 you  you are sure you know a lock when you do see one  
i asked hesitatingly not wishing to offend her 
the question did offend her however and she suggested that i had better look for myself so i laid down the sculls and took a view 
the river stretched out straight before us in the twilight for about a mile not a ghost of a lock was to be seen 
 you don t think we have lost our way do you  
asked my companion 
i did not see how that was possible though as i suggested we might have somehow got into the weir stream and be making for the falls 
this idea did not comfort her in the least and she began to cry 
she said we should both be drowned and that it was a judgment on her for coming out with me 
it seemed an excessive punishment i thought but my cousin thought not and hoped it would all soon be over 
i tried to reassure her and to make light of the whole affair 
i said that the fact evidently was that i was not rowing as fast as i fancied i was but that we should soon reach the lock now and i pulled on for another mile 
then i began to get nervous myself 
i looked again at the map 
there was wallingford lock clearly marked a mile and a half below benson s 
it was a good reliable map and besides i recollected the lock myself 
i had been through it twice 
where were we 
what had happened to us 
i began to think it must be all a dream and that i was really asleep in bed and should wake up in a minute and be told it was past ten 
i asked my cousin if she thought it could be a dream and she replied that she was just about to ask me the same question and then we both wondered if we were both asleep and if so who was the real one that was dreaming and who was the one that was only a dream it got quite interesting 
i still went on pulling however and still no lock came in sight and the river grew more and more gloomy and mysterious under the gathering shadows of night and things seemed to be getting weird and uncanny 
i thought of hobgoblins and banshees and will o  the wisps and those wicked girls who sit up all night on rocks and lure people into whirl pools and things and i wished i had been a better man and knew more hymns and in the middle of these reflections i heard the blessed strains of he s got em on  played badly on a concertina and knew that we were saved 
i do not admire the tones of a concertina as a rule but oh 
how beautiful the music seemed to us both then  far far more beautiful than the voice of orpheus or the lute of apollo or anything of that sort could have sounded 
heavenly melody in our then state of mind would only have still further harrowed us 
a soul moving harmony correctly performed we should have taken as a spirit warning and have given up all hope 
but about the strains of he s got em on  jerked spasmodically and with involuntary variations out of a wheezy accordion there was something singularly human and reassuring 
the sweet sounds drew nearer and soon the boat from which they were worked lay alongside us 
it contained a party of provincial arrys and arriets out for a moonlight sail 
 there was not any moon but that was not their fault  
i never saw more attractive lovable people in all my life 
i hailed them and asked if they could tell me the way to wallingford lock and i explained that i had been looking for it for the last two hours 
 wallingford lock  
they answered 
 lor love you sir that s been done away with for over a year 
there ain t no wallingford lock now sir 
you re close to cleeve now 
blow me tight if ere ain t a gentleman been looking for wallingford lock bill  
i had never thought of that 
i wanted to fall upon all their necks and bless them but the stream was running too strong just there to allow of this so i had to content myself with mere cold sounding words of gratitude 
we thanked them over and over again and we said it was a lovely night and we wished them a pleasant trip and i think i invited them all to come and spend a week with me and my cousin said her mother would be so pleased to see them 
and we sang the soldiers chorus out of  faust  and got home in time for supper after all 
 picture people in rowing boat     chapter x 
our first night   under canvas   an appeal for help   contrariness of tea kettles how to overcome   supper   how to feel virtuous   wanted 
a comfortably appointed well drained desert island neighbourhood of south pacific ocean preferred   funny thing that happened to george s father   a restless night 
harris and i began to think that bell weir lock must have been done away with after the same manner 
george had towed us up to staines and we had taken the boat from there and it seemed that we were dragging fifty tons after us and were walking forty miles 
it was half past seven when we were through and we all got in and sculled up close to the left bank looking out for a spot to haul up in 
we had originally intended to go on to magna charta island a sweetly pretty part of the river where it winds through a soft green valley and to camp in one of the many picturesque inlets to be found round that tiny shore 
but somehow we did not feel that we yearned for the picturesque nearly so much now as we had earlier in the day 
a bit of water between a coal barge and a gas works would have quite satisfied us for that night 
we did not want scenery 
we wanted to have our supper and go to bed 
however we did pull up to the point   picnic point  it is called  and dropped into a very pleasant nook under a great elm tree to the spreading roots of which we fastened the boat 
then we thought we were going to have supper we had dispensed with tea so as to save time  but george said no that we had better get the canvas up first before it got quite dark and while we could see what we were doing 
then he said all our work would be done and we could sit down to eat with an easy mind 
that canvas wanted more putting up than i think any of us had bargained for 
it looked so simple in the abstract 
you took five iron arches like gigantic croquet hoops and fitted them up over the boat and then stretched the canvas over them and fastened it down it would take quite ten minutes we thought 
that was an under estimate 
we took up the hoops and began to drop them into the sockets placed for them 
you would not imagine this to be dangerous work but looking back now the wonder to me is that any of us are alive to tell the tale 
they were not hoops they were demons 
first they would not fit into their sockets at all and we had to jump on them and kick them and hammer at them with the boat hook and when they were in it turned out that they were the wrong hoops for those particular sockets and they had to come out again 
but they would not come out until two of us had gone and struggled with them for five minutes when they would jump up suddenly and try and throw us into the water and drown us 
they had hinges in the middle and when we were not looking they nipped us with these hinges in delicate parts of the body and while we were wrestling with one side of the hoop and endeavouring to persuade it to do its duty the other side would come behind us in a cowardly manner and hit us over the head 
we got them fixed at last and then all that was to be done was to arrange the covering over them 
george unrolled it and fastened one end over the nose of the boat 
harris stood in the middle to take it from george and roll it on to me and i kept by the stern to receive it 
it was a long time coming down to me 
george did his part all right but it was new work to harris and he bungled it 
how he managed it i do not know he could not explain himself but by some mysterious process or other he succeeded after ten minutes of superhuman effort in getting himself completely rolled up in it 
he was so firmly wrapped round and tucked in and folded over that he could not get out 
he of course made frantic struggles for freedom  the birthright of every englishman   and in doing so i learned this afterwards  knocked over george and then george swearing at harris began to struggle too and got  himself  entangled and rolled up 
 picture watching and waiting i knew nothing about all this at the time 
i did not understand the business at all myself 
i had been told to stand where i was and wait till the canvas came to me and montmorency and i stood there and waited both as good as gold 
we could see the canvas being violently jerked and tossed about pretty considerably but we supposed this was part of the method and did not interfere 
we also heard much smothered language coming from underneath it and we guessed that they were finding the job rather troublesome and concluded that we would wait until things had got a little simpler before we joined in 
we waited some time but matters seemed to get only more and more involved until at last george s head came wriggling out over the side of the boat and spoke up 
it said  give us a hand here can t you you cuckoo standing there like a stuffed mummy when you see we are both being suffocated you dummy  
i never could withstand an appeal for help so i went and undid them not before it was time either for harris was nearly black in the face 
it took us half an hour s hard labour after that before it was properly up and then we cleared the decks and got out supper 
we put the kettle on to boil up in the nose of the boat and went down to the stern and pretended to take no notice of it but set to work to get the other things out 
that is the only way to get a kettle to boil up the river 
if it sees that you are waiting for it and are anxious it will never even sing 
you have to go away and begin your meal as if you were not going to have any tea at all 
you must not even look round at it 
then you will soon hear it sputtering away mad to be made into tea 
it is a good plan too if you are in a great hurry to talk very loudly to each other about how you don t need any tea and are not going to have any 
you get near the kettle so that it can overhear you and then you shout out i don t want any tea do you george  
to which george shouts back oh no i don t like tea we ll have lemonade instead  tea s so indigestible  
upon which the kettle boils over and puts the stove out 
we adopted this harmless bit of trickery and the result was that by the time everything else was ready the tea was waiting 
then we lit the lantern and squatted down to supper 
we wanted that supper 
for five and thirty minutes not a sound was heard throughout the length and breadth of that boat save the clank of cutlery and crockery and the steady grinding of four sets of molars 
at the end of five and thirty minutes harris said ah  
and took his left leg out from under him and put his right one there instead 
five minutes afterwards george said ah  
too and threw his plate out on the bank and three minutes later than that montmorency gave the first sign of contentment he had exhibited since we had started and rolled over on his side and spread his legs out and then i said ah  
and bent my head back and bumped it against one of the hoops but i did not mind it 
i did not even swear 
how good one feels when one is full  how satisfied with ourselves and with the world 
people who have tried it tell me that a clear conscience makes you very happy and contented but a full stomach does the business quite as well and is cheaper and more easily obtained 
one feels so forgiving and generous after a substantial and well digested meal  so noble minded so kindly hearted 
it is very strange this domination of our intellect by our digestive organs 
we cannot work we cannot think unless our stomach wills so 
it dictates to us our emotions our passions 
after eggs and bacon it says work  
after beefsteak and porter it says sleep  
after a cup of tea two spoonsful for each cup and don t let it stand more than three minutes  it says to the brain now rise and show your strength 
be eloquent and deep and tender see with a clear eye into nature and into life spread your white wings of quivering thought and soar a god like spirit over the whirling world beneath you up through long lanes of flaming stars to the gates of eternity  
after hot muffins it says be dull and soulless like a beast of the field  a brainless animal with listless eye unlit by any ray of fancy or of hope or fear or love or life  
and after brandy taken in sufficient quantity it says now come fool grin and tumble that your fellow men may laugh  drivel in folly and splutter in senseless sounds and show what a helpless ninny is poor man whose wit and will are drowned like kittens side by side in half an inch of alcohol  
we are but the veriest sorriest slaves of our stomach
