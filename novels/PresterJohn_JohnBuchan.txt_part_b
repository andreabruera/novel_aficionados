yours.  I am his prisoner.  But if you lift your hand on me to-day so
as to draw one drop of blood the Inkulu will make short work of you.
The vow is upon you, and if you break it you know what happens.'  And I
repeated, in a fair imitation of the priest's voice, the terrible curse
he had pronounced in the cave.

You should have seen the change in that cur's face.  I had guessed he
was a coward, as he was most certainly a bully, and now I knew it.  He
shivered, and drew his hand over his eyes.

'Nay, Baas,' he pleaded, 'it was but a joke.  No harm shall come on you
to-day.  But tomorrow--' and his ugly face grew more cheerful.

'To-morrow we shall see what we shall see,' I said stoically, and a
loud drum-beat sounded through the camp.

It was the signal for moving, for in the east a thin pale line of gold
was beginning to show over the trees.  The bonds at my knees and ankles
were cut, and I was bundled on to the back of a horse.  Then my feet
were strapped firmly below its belly. The bridle of my beast was tied
to 'Mwanga's, so that there was little chance of escape even if I had
been unshackled.

My thoughts were very gloomy.  So far all had happened as I planned,
but I seemed to have lost my nerve, and I could not believe in my
rescue at the Letaba, while I thought of Inanda's Kraal with sheer
horror.  Last night I had looked into the heart of darkness, and the
sight had terrified me.  What part should I play in the great
purification?  Most likely that of the Biblical scapegoat.  But the
dolour of my mind was surpassed by the discomfort of my body.  I was
broken with pains and weariness, and I had a desperate headache.  Also,
before we had gone a mile, I began to think that I should split in two.
The paces of my beast were uneven, to say the best of it, and the
bump-bump was like being on the rack.  I remembered that the saints of
the Covenant used to journey to prison this way, especially the great
Mr Peden, and I wondered how they liked it.  When I hear of a man doing
a brave deed, I always want to discover whether at the time he was well
and comfortable in body. That, I am certain, is the biggest ingredient
in courage, and those who plan and execute great deeds in bodily
weakness have my homage as truly heroic.  For myself, I had not the
spirit of a chicken as I jogged along at 'Mwanga's side.  I wished he
would begin to insult me, if only to distract my mind, but he kept
obstinately silent.  He was sulky, and I think rather afraid of me.

As the sun got up I could see something of the host around me.  I am no
hand at guessing numbers, but I should put the fighting men I saw at
not less than twenty thousand.  Every man of them was on this side his
prime, and all were armed with good rifles and bandoliers.  There were
none of your old roers[1] and decrepit Enfields, which I had seen signs
of in Kaffir kraals.  These guns were new, serviceable Mausers, and the
men who bore them looked as if they knew how to handle them.  There
must have been long months of training behind this show, and I
marvelled at the man who had organized it.  I saw no field-guns, and
the little transport they had was evidently for food only.  We did not
travel in ranks like an orthodox column.  About a third of the force
was mounted, and this formed the centre.  On each wing the infantry
straggled far afield, but there was method in their disorder, for in
the bush close ranks would have been impossible.  At any rate we kept
wonderfully well together, and when we mounted a knoll the whole army
seemed to move in one piece.  I was well in the rear of the centre
column, but from the crest of a slope I sometimes got a view in front.
I could see nothing of Laputa, who was probably with the van, but in
the very heart of the force I saw the old priest of the Snake, with his
treasure carried in the kind of litter which the Portuguese call a
machila, between rows of guards.  A white man rode beside him, whom I
judged to be Henriques.  Laputa trusted this fellow, and I wondered
why.  I had not forgotten the look on his face while he had stared at
the rubies in the cave.  I had a notion that the Portugoose might be an
unsuspected ally of mine, though for blackguard reasons.

About ten o'clock, as far as I could judge by the sun, we passed
Umvelos', and took the right bank of the Labongo. There was nothing in
the store to loot, but it was overrun by Kaffirs, who carried off the
benches for firewood.  It gave me an odd feeling to see the remains of
the meal at which I had entertained Laputa in the hands of a dozen
warriors.  I thought of the long sunny days when I had sat by my
nachtmaal while the Dutch farmers rode in to trade.  Now these men were
all dead, and I was on my way to the same bourne.

Soon the blue line of the Berg rose in the west, and through the corner
of my eye, as I rode, I could see the gap of the Klein Labongo.  I
wondered if Arcoll and his men were up there watching us.  About this
time I began to be so wretched in body that I ceased to think of the
future.  I had had no food for seventeen hours, and I was dropping from
lack of sleep. The ache of my bones was so great that I found myself
crying like a baby.  What between pain and weakness and nervous
exhaustion, I was almost at the end of my tether, and should have
fainted dead away if a halt had not been called.  But about midday,
after we had crossed the track from Blaauwildebeestefontein to the
Portuguese frontier, we came to the broad, shallow drift of the Klein
Labongo.  It is the way of the Kaffirs to rest at noon, and on the
other side of the drift we encamped. I remember the smell of hot earth
and clean water as my horse scrambled up the bank.  Then came the smell
of wood-smoke as fires were lit.  It seemed an age after we stopped
before my feet were loosed and I was allowed to fall over on the
ground. I lay like a log where I fell, and was asleep in ten seconds. I
awoke two hours later much refreshed, and with a raging hunger.  My
ankles and knees had been tied again, but the sleep had taken the worst
stiffness out of my joints.  The natives were squatting in groups round
their fires, but no one came near me.  I satisfied myself by straining
at my bonds that this solitude gave no chance of escape.  I wanted
food, and I shouted on 'Mwanga, but he never came.  Then I rolled over
into the shadow of a wacht-en-beetje bush to get out of the glare.

I saw a Kaffir on the other side of the bush who seemed to be grinning
at me.  Slowly he moved round to my side, and stood regarding me with
interest.

'For God's sake get me some food,' I said.

'Ja, Baas,' was the answer; and he disappeared for a minute, and
returned with a wooden bowl of hot mealie-meal porridge, and a calabash
full of water.

I could not use my hands, so he fed me with the blade of his knife.
Such porridge without salt or cream is beastly food, but my hunger was
so great that I could have eaten a vat of it.

Suddenly it appeared that the Kaffir had something to say to me.  As he
fed me he began to speak in a low voice in English.

'Baas,' he said, 'I come from Ratitswan, and I have a message for you.'

I guessed that Ratitswan was the native name for Arcoll. There was no
one else likely to send a message. 'Ratitswan says,' he went on, "'Look
out for Dupree's Drift." I will be near you and cut your bonds; then
you must swim across when Ratitswan begins to shoot.'

The news took all the weight of care from my mind.  Colin had got home,
and my friends were out for rescue.  So volatile is the mood of 19 that
I veered round from black despair to an unwarranted optimism.  I saw
myself already safe, and Laputa's rising scattered.  I saw my hands on
the treasure, and Henriques' ugly neck below my heel.

'I don't know your name,' I said to the Kaffir, 'but you are a good
fellow.  When I get out of this business I won't forget you.'

'There is another message, Baas,' he said.  'It is written on paper in
a strange tongue.  Turn your head to the bush, and see, I will hold it
inside the bowl, that you may read it.'

I did as I was told, and found myself looking at a dirty half-sheet of
notepaper, marked by the Kaffir's thumbs.  Some words were written on
it in Wardlaw's hand; and, characteristically, in Latin, which was not
a bad cipher.  I read--

'_Henricus de Letaba transeunda apud Duprei vada jam nos certiores
fecit._'[2]

I had guessed rightly.  Henriques was a traitor to the cause he had
espoused.  Arcoll's message had given me new heart, but Wardlaw's gave
me information of tremendous value.  I repented that I had ever
underrated the schoolmaster's sense. He did not come out of Aberdeen
for nothing.

I asked the Kaffir how far it was to Dupree's Drift, and was told three
hours' march.  We should get there after the darkening. It seemed he
had permission to ride with me instead of 'Mwanga, who had no love for
the job.  How he managed this I do not know; but Arcoll's men had their
own ways of doing things.  He undertook to set me free when the first
shot was fired at the ford.  Meantime I bade him leave me, to avert
suspicion.

There is a story of one of King Arthur's knights--Sir Percival, I
think--that once, riding through a forest, he found a lion fighting
with a serpent.  He drew his sword and helped the lion, for he thought
it was the more natural beast of the two.  To me Laputa was the lion,
and Henriques the serpent; and though I had no good will to either, I
was determined to spoil the serpent's game.  He was after the rubies,
as I had fancied; he had never been after anything else. He had found
out about Arcoll's preparations, and had sent him a warning, hoping, no
doubt, that, if Laputa's force was scattered on the Letaba, he would
have a chance of getting off with the necklace in the confusion.  If he
succeeded, he would go over the Lebombo to Mozambique, and whatever
happened afterwards in the rising would be no concern of Mr Henriques.
I determined that he should fail; but how to manage it I could not see.
Had I had a pistol, I think I would have shot him; but I had no weapon
of any kind.  I could not warn Laputa, for that would seal my own fate,
even if I were believed.  It was clear that Laputa must go to Dupree's
Drift, for otherwise I could not escape; and it was equally clear that
I must find the means of spoiling the Portugoose's game.

A shadow fell across the sunlight, and I looked up to see the man I was
thinking of standing before me.  He had a cigarette in his mouth, and
his hands in the pockets of his riding-breeches. He stood eyeing me
with a curious smile on his face.

'Well, Mr Storekeeper,' he said, 'you and I have met before under
pleasanter circumstances.'

I said nothing, my mind being busy with what to do at the drift.

'We were shipmates, if I am not mistaken,' he said.  'I dare say you
found it nicer work smoking on the after-deck than lying here in the
sun.'

Still I said nothing.  If the man had come to mock me, he would get no
change out of David Crawfurd.

'Tut, tut, don't be sulky.  You have no quarrel with me. Between
ourselves,' and he dropped his voice, 'I tried to save you; but you had
seen rather too much to be safe.  What devil prompted you to steal a
horse and go to the cave?  I don't blame you for overhearing us; but if
you had had the sense of a louse you would have gone off to the Berg
with your news.  By the way, how did you manage it?  A cellar, I
suppose.  Our friend Laputa was a fool not to take better precautions;
but I must say you acted the drunkard pretty well.'

The vanity of 19 is an incalculable thing.  I rose to the fly.

'I know the kind of precaution you wanted to take,' I muttered.

'You heard that too?  Well, I confess I am in favour of doing a job
thoroughly when I take it up.'

'In the Koodoo Flats, for example,' I said.

He sat down beside me, and laughed softly.  'You heard my little story?
You are clever, Mr Storekeeper, but not quite clever enough.  What if I
can act a part as well as yourself?' And he thrust his yellow face
close to mine.

I saw his meaning, and did not for a second believe him; but I had the
sense to temporize.

'Do you mean to say that you did not kill the Dutchmen, and did not
mean to knife me?'

'I mean to say that I am not a fool,' he said, lighting another
cigarette.

'I am a white man, Mr Storekeeper, and I play the white man's game.
Why do you think I am here?  Simply because I was the only man in
Africa who had the pluck to get to the heart of this business.  I am
here to dish Laputa, and by God I am going to do it.'

I was scarcely prepared for such incredible bluff.  I knew every word
was a lie, but I wanted to hear more, for the man fascinated me.

'I suppose you know what will happen to you,' he said, flicking the
ashes from his cigarette.  'To-morrow at Inanda's Kraal, when the vow
is over, they will give you a taste of Kaffir habits.  Not death, my
friend--that would be simple enough--but a slow death with every
refinement of horror.  You have broken into their sacred places, and
you will be sacrificed to Laputa's god.  I have seen native torture
before, and his own mother would run away shrieking from a man who had
endured it.'

I said nothing, but the thought made my flesh creep.

'Well,' he went on, 'you're in an awkward plight, but I think I can
help you.  What if I can save your life, Mr Storekeeper? You are
trussed up like a fowl, and can do nothing.  I am the only man alive
who can help you.  I am willing to do it, too--on my own terms.'

I did not wait to hear those terms, for I had a shrewd guess what they
would be.  My hatred of Henriques rose and choked me.  I saw murder and
trickery in his mean eyes and cruel mouth.  I could not, to be saved
from the uttermost horror, have made myself his ally.

'Now listen, Mr Portugoose,' I cried.  'You tell me you are a spy.
What if I shout that through the camp?  There will be short shrift for
you if Laputa hears it.'

He laughed loudly.  'You are a bigger fool than I took you for.  Who
would believe you, my friend.  Not Laputa.  Not any man in this army.
It would only mean tighter bonds for these long legs of yours.'

By this time I had given up all thought of diplomacy.  'Very well, you
yellow-faced devil, you will hear my answer.  I would not take my
freedom from you, though I were to be boiled alive.  I know you for a
traitor to the white man's cause, a dirty I.D.B. swindler, whose name
is a byword among honest men. By your own confession you are a traitor
to this idiot rising. You murdered the Dutchmen and God knows how many
more, and you would fain have murdered me.  I pray to Heaven that the
men whose cause you have betrayed and the men whose cause you would
betray may join to stamp the life out of you and send your soul to
hell. I know the game you would have me join in, and I fling your offer
in your face.  But I tell you one thing--you are damned yourself. The
white men are out, and you will never get over the Lebombo. From black
or white you will get justice before many hours, and your carcass will
be left to rot in the bush.  Get out of my sight, you swine.'

In that moment I was so borne up in my passion that I forgot my bonds
and my grave danger.  I was inspired like a prophet with a sense of
approaching retribution.  Henriques heard me out; but his smile changed
to a scowl, and a flush rose on his sallow cheek.

'Stew in your own juice,' he said, and spat in my face.  Then he
shouted in Kaffir that I had insulted him, and demanded that I should
be bound tighter and gagged.

It was Arcoll's messenger who answered his summons.  That admirable
fellow rushed at me with a great appearance of savagery.  He made a
pretence of swathing me up in fresh rawhide ropes, but his knots were
loose and the thing was a farce. He gagged me with what looked like a
piece of wood, but was in reality a chunk of dry banana.  And all the
while, till Henriques was out of hearing, he cursed me with a noble
gift of tongues.

The drums beat for the advance, and once more I was hoisted on my
horse, while Arcoll's Kaffir tied my bridle to his own.  A Kaffir
cannot wink, but he has a way of slanting his eyes which does as well,
and as we moved on he would turn his head to me with this strange
grimace.

Henriques wanted me to help him to get the rubies--that I presumed was
the offer he had meant to make.  Well, thought I, I will perish before
the jewel reaches the Portuguese's hands. He hoped for a stampede when
Arcoll opposed the crossing of the river, and in the confusion intended
to steal the casket.  My plan must be to get as near the old priest as
possible before we reached the ford.  I spoke to my warder and told him
what I wanted.  He nodded, and in the first mile we managed to edge a
good way forward.  Several things came to aid us.  As I have said, we
of the centre were not marching in close ranks, but in a loose column,
and often it was possible by taking a short cut on rough ground to join
the column some distance ahead. There was a vlei, too, which many
circumvented, but we swam, and this helped our lead.  In a couple of
hours we were so near the priest's litter that I could have easily
tossed a cricket ball on the head of Henriques who rode beside it.

Very soon the twilight of the winter day began to fall.  The far hills
grew pink and mulberry in the sunset, and strange shadows stole over
the bush.  Still creeping forward, we found ourselves not twenty yards
behind the litter, while far ahead I saw a broad, glimmering space of
water with a high woody bank beyond.

'Dupree's Drift;' whispered my warder.  'Courage, Inkoos;[3] in an
hour's time you will be free.'


[1] Boer elephant guns.

[2] 'Henriques has already told us about the crossing at Dupree's
Drift.'

[3] Great chief.



CHAPTER XIII

THE DRIFT OF THE LETABA

The dusk was gathering fast as we neared the stream.  From the stagnant
reaches above and below a fine white mist was rising, but the long
shallows of the ford were clear.  My heart was beginning to flutter
wildly, but I kept a tight grip on myself and prayed for patience.  As
I stared into the evening my hopes sank.  I had expected, foolishly
enough, to see on the far bank some sign of my friends, but the tall
bush was dead and silent.

The drift slants across the river at an acute angle, roughly S.S.W.  I
did not know this at the time, and was amazed to see the van of the
march turn apparently up stream.  Laputa's great voice rang out in some
order which was repeated down the column, and the wide flanks of the
force converged on the narrow cart-track which entered the water.  We
had come to a standstill while the front ranks began the passage.

I sat shaking with excitement, my eyes straining into the gloom.  Water
holds the evening light for long, and I could make out pretty clearly
what was happening.  The leading horsemen rode into the stream with
Laputa in front.  The ford is not the best going, so they had to pick
their way, but in five or ten minutes they were over.  Then came some
of the infantry of the flanks, who crossed with the water to their
waists, and their guns held high above their heads.  They made a
portentous splashing, but not a sound came from their throats.  I shall
never know how Laputa imposed silence on the most noisy race on earth.
Several thousand footmen must have followed the riders, and disappeared
into the far bush.  But not a shot came from the bluffs in front.

I watched with a sinking heart.  Arcoll had failed, and there was to be
no check at the drift.  There remained for me only the horrors at
Inanda's Kraal.  I resolved to make a dash for freedom, at all costs,
and was in the act of telling Arcoll's man to cut my bonds, when a
thought occurred to me.

Henriques was after the rubies, and it was his interest to get Laputa
across the river before the attack began.  It was Arcoll's business to
split the force, and above all to hold up the leader. Henriques would
tell him, and for that matter he must have assumed himself, that Laputa
would ride in the centre of the force.  Therefore there would be no
check till the time came for the priest's litter to cross.

It was well that I had not had my bonds cut.  Henriques came riding
towards me, his face sharp and bright as a ferret's. He pulled up and
asked if I were safe.  My Kaffir showed my strapped elbows and feet,
and tugged at the cords to prove their tightness.

'Keep him well,' said Henriques, 'or you will answer to Inkulu.
Forward with him now and get him through the water.'  Then he turned
and rode back.

My warder, apparently obeying orders, led me out of the column and into
the bush on the right hand.  Soon we were abreast of the litter and
some twenty yards to the west of it. The water gleamed through the
trees a few paces in front.  I could see the masses of infantry
converging on the drift, and the churning like a cascade which they
made in the passage.

Suddenly from the far bank came an order.  It was Laputa's voice, thin
and high-pitched, as the Kaffir cries when he wishes his words to carry
a great distance.  Henriques repeated it, and the infantry halted.  The
riders of the column in front of the litter began to move into the
stream.

We should have gone with them, but instead we pulled our horses back
into the darkness of the bush.  It seemed to me that odd things were
happening around the priest's litter. Henriques had left it, and dashed
past me so close that I could have touched him.  From somewhere among
the trees a pistol-shot cracked into the air.

As if in answer to a signal the high bluff across the stream burst into
a sheet of fire.  'A sheet of fire' sounds odd enough for scientific
warfare.  I saw that my friends were using shot-guns and firing with
black powder into the mob in the water. It was humane and it was good
tactics, for the flame in the grey dusk had the appearance of a heavy
battery of ordnance. Once again I heard Henriques' voice.  He was
turning the column to the right.  He shouted to them to get into cover,
and take the water higher up.  I thought, too, that from far away I
heard Laputa.

These were maddening seconds.  We had left the business of cutting my
bonds almost too late.  In the darkness of the bush the strips of hide
could only be felt for, and my Kaffir had a woefully blunt knife.
Reims are always tough to sever, and mine had to be sawn through.  Soon
my arms were free, and I was plucking at my other bonds.  The worst
were those on my ankles below the horse's belly.  The Kaffir fumbled
away in the dark, and pricked my beast so that he reared and struck
out. And all the while I was choking with impatience, and gabbling
prayers to myself.

The men on the other side had begun to use ball-cartridge. I could see
through a gap the centre of the river, and it was filled with a mass of
struggling men and horses.  I remember that it amazed me that no shot
was fired in return.  Then I remembered the vow, and was still more
amazed at the power of a ritual on that savage horde.

The column was moving past me to the right.  It was a disorderly rabble
which obeyed Henriques' orders.  Bullets began to sing through the
trees, and one rider was hit in the shoulder and came down with a
crash.  This increased the confusion, for most of them dismounted and
tried to lead their horses in the cover.  The infantry coming in from
the wings collided with them, and there was a struggle of excited
beasts and men in the thickets of thorn and mopani.  And still my
Kaffir was trying to get my ankles loose as fast as a plunging horse
would let him. At last I was free, and dropped stiffly to the ground.
I fell prone on my face with cramp, and when I got up I rolled like a
drunk man.  Here I made a great blunder.  I should have left my horse
with my Kaffir, and bidden him follow me.  But I was too eager to be
cautious, so I let it go, and crying to the Kaffir to await me, I ran
towards the litter.

Henriques had laid his plans well.  The column had abandoned the
priest, and by the litter were only the two bearers. As I caught sight
of them one fell with a bullet in his chest. The other, wild with
fright, kept turning his head to every quarter of the compass.  Another
bullet passed close to his head.  This was too much for him, and with a
yell he ran away.

As I broke through the thicket I looked to the quarter whence the
bullets had come.  These, I could have taken my oath, were not fired by
my friends on the farther bank.  It was close-quarter shooting, and I
knew who had done it.  But I saw nobody.  The last few yards of the
road were clear, and only out in the water was the struggling shouting
mass of humanity. I saw a tall man on a big horse plunge into the river
on his way back.  It must be Laputa returning to command the panic.

My business was not with Laputa but with Henriques.  The old priest in
the litter, who had been sleeping, had roused himself, and was looking
vacantly round him.  He did not look long.  A third bullet, fired from
a dozen yards away, drilled a hole in his forehead.  He fell back dead,
and the ivory box, which lay on his lap, tilted forward on the ground.

I had no weapon of any kind, and I did not want the fourth bullet for
myself.  Henriques was too pretty a shot to trifle with.  I waited
quietly on the edge of the shade till the Portugoose came out of the
thicket.  I saw him running forward with a rifle in his hand.  A whinny
from a horse told me that somewhere near his beast was tied up.  It was
all but dark, but it seemed to me that I could see the lust of greed in
his eyes as he rushed to the litter.

Very softly I stole behind him.  He tore off the lid of the box, and
pulled out the great necklace.  For a second it hung in his hands, but
only for a second.  So absorbed was he that he did not notice me
standing full before him.  Nay, he lifted his head, and gave me the
finest chance of my life.  I was something of a boxer, and all my
accumulated fury went into the blow.  It caught him on the point of the
chin, and his neck cricked like the bolt of a rifle.  He fell limply on
the ground and the jewels dropped from his hand.

I picked them up and stuffed them into my breeches pocket.

Then I pulled the pistol out of his belt.  It was six-chambered, and I
knew that only three had been emptied.  I remembered feeling
extraordinarily cool and composed, and yet my wits must have been
wandering or I would have never taken the course I did.

The right thing to do--on Arcoll's instructions--was to make for the
river and swim across to my friends.  But Laputa was coming back, and I
dreaded meeting him.  Laputa seemed to my heated fancy omnipresent.  I
thought of him as covering the whole bank of the river, whereas I might
easily have crossed a little farther down, and made my way up the other
bank to my friends.  It was plain that Laputa intended to evade the
patrol, not to capture it, and there, consequently, I should be safe.
The next best thing was to find Arcoll's Kaffir, who was not twenty
yards away, get some sort of horse, and break for the bush.  Long
before morning we should have been over the Berg and in safety.  Nay,
if I wanted a mount, there was Henriques' whinnying a few paces off.

Instead I did the craziest thing of all.  With the jewels in one
pocket, and the Portugoose's pistol in the other, I started running
back the road we had come.



CHAPTER XIV

I CARRY THE COLLAR OF PRESTER JOHN

I ran till my breath grew short, for some kind of swift motion I had to
have or choke.  The events of the last few minutes had inflamed my
brain.  For the first time in my life I had seen men die by
violence--nay, by brutal murder.  I had put my soul into the blow which
laid out Henriques, and I was still hot with the pride of it.  Also I
had in my pocket the fetich of the whole black world; I had taken their
Ark of the Covenant, and soon Laputa would be on my trail.  Fear,
pride, and a blind exultation all throbbed in my veins.  I must have
run three miles before I came to my sober senses.

I put my ear to the ground, but heard no sound of pursuit. Laputa, I
argued, would have enough to do for a little, shepherding his flock
over the water.  He might surround and capture the patrol, or he might
evade it; the vow prevented him from fighting it.  On the whole I was
clear that he would ignore it and push on for the rendezvous.  All this
would take time, and the business of the priest would have to wait.
When Henriques came to he would no doubt have a story to tell, and the
scouts would be on my trail.  I wished I had shot the Portugoose while
I was at the business.  It would have been no murder, but a righteous
execution.

Meanwhile I must get off the road.  The sand had been disturbed by an
army, so there was little fear of my steps being traced.  Still it was
only wise to leave the track which I would be assumed to have taken,
for Laputa would guess I had fled back the way to
Blaauwildebeestefontein.  I turned into the bush, which here was thin
and sparse like whins on a common.

The Berg must be my goal.  Once on the plateau I would be inside the
white man's lines.  Down here in the plains I was in the country of my
enemies.  Arcoll meant to fight on the uplands when it came to
fighting.  The black man might rage as he pleased in his own flats, but
we stood to defend the gates of the hills.  Therefore over the Berg I
must be before morning, or there would be a dead man with no tales to
tell.

I think that even at the start of that night's work I realized the
exceeding precariousness of my chances.  Some twenty miles of bush and
swamp separated me from the foot of the mountains.  After that there
was the climbing of them, for at the point opposite where I now stood
the Berg does not descend sharply on the plain, but is broken into
foot-hills around the glens of the Klein Letaba and the Letsitela.
From the spot where these rivers emerge on the flats to the crown of
the plateau is ten miles at the shortest.  I had a start of an hour or
so, but before dawn I had to traverse thirty miles of unknown and
difficult country.  Behind me would follow the best trackers in Africa,
who knew every foot of the wilderness. It was a wild hazard, but it was
my only hope.  At this time I was feeling pretty courageous.  For one
thing I had Henriques' pistol close to my leg, and for another I still
thrilled with the satisfaction of having smitten his face.

I took the rubies, and stowed them below my shirt and next my skin.  I
remember taking stock of my equipment and laughing at the humour of it.
One of the heels was almost twisted off my boots, and my shirt and
breeches were old at the best and ragged from hard usage.  The whole
outfit would have been dear at five shillings, or seven-and-six with
the belt thrown in.  Then there was the Portugoose's pistol, costing,
say, a guinea; and last, the Prester's collar, worth several millions.

What was more important than my clothing was my bodily strength.  I was
still very sore from the bonds and the jog of that accursed horse, but
exercise was rapidly suppling my joints.  About five hours ago I had
eaten a filling, though not very sustaining, meal, and I thought I
could go on very well till morning.  But I was still badly in arrears
with my sleep, and there was no chance of my snatching a minute till I
was over the Berg.  It was going to be a race against time, and I swore
that I would drive my body to the last ounce of strength.

Moonrise was still an hour or two away, and the sky was bright with
myriad stars.  I knew now what starlight meant, for there was ample
light to pick my way by.  I steered by the Southern Cross, for I was
aware that the Berg ran north and south, and with that constellation on
my left hand I was bound to reach it sooner or later.  The bush closed
around me with its mysterious dull green shades, and trees, which in
the daytime were thin scrub, now loomed like tall timber.  It was very
eerie moving, a tiny fragment of mortality, in that great wide silent
wilderness, with the starry vault, like an impassive celestial
audience, watching with many eyes.  They cheered me, those stars.  In
my hurry and fear and passion they spoke of the old calm dignities of
man.  I felt less alone when I turned my face to the lights which were
slanting alike on this uncanny bush and on the homely streets of
Kirkcaple.

The silence did not last long.  First came the howl of a wolf, to be
answered by others from every quarter of the compass. This serenade
went on for a bit, till the jackals chimed in with their harsh bark.  I
had been caught by darkness before this when hunting on the Berg, but I
was not afraid of wild beasts. That is one terror of the bush which
travellers' tales have put too high.  It was true that I might meet a
hungry lion, but the chance was remote, and I had my pistol.  Once
indeed a huge animal bounded across the road a little in front of me.
For a moment I took him for a lion, but on reflection I was inclined to
think him a very large bush-pig.

By this time I was out of the thickest bush and into a piece of
parkland with long, waving tambuki grass, which the Kaffirs would burn
later.  The moon was coming up, and her faint rays silvered the flat
tops of the mimosa trees.  I could hear and feel around me the rustling
of animals.  Once or twice a big buck--an eland or a koodoo--broke
cover, and at the sight of me went off snorting down the slope.  Also
there were droves of smaller game--rhebok and springbok and
duikers--which brushed past at full gallop without even noticing me.

The sight was so novel that it set me thinking.  That shy wild things
should stampede like this could only mean that they had been thoroughly
scared.  Now obviously the thing that scared them must be on this side
of the Letaba.  This must mean that Laputa's army, or a large part of
it, had not crossed at Dupree's Drift, but had gone up the stream to
some higher ford.  If that was so, I must alter my course; so I bore
away to the right for a mile or two, making a line due north-west.

In about an hour's time the ground descended steeply, and I saw before
me the shining reaches of a river.  I had the chief features of the
countryside clear in my mind, both from old porings over maps, and from
Arcoll's instructions.  This stream must be the Little Letaba, and I
must cross it if I would get to the mountains.  I remembered that
Majinje's kraal stood on its left bank, and higher up in its valley in
the Berg 'Mpefu lived. At all costs the kraals must be avoided.  Once
across it I must make for the Letsitela, another tributary of the Great
Letaba, and by keeping the far bank of that stream I should cross the
mountains to the place on the plateau of the Wood Bush which Arcoll had
told me would be his headquarters.

It is easy to talk about crossing a river, and looking to-day at the
slender streak on the map I am amazed that so small a thing should have
given me such ugly tremors.  Yet I have rarely faced a job I liked so
little.  The stream ran yellow and sluggish under the clear moon.  On
the near side a thick growth of bush clothed the bank, but on the far
side I made out a swamp with tall bulrushes.  The distance across was
no more than fifty yards, but I would have swum a mile more readily in
deep water.  The place stank of crocodiles.  There was no ripple to
break the oily flow except where a derelict branch swayed with the
current.  Something in the stillness, the eerie light on the water, and
the rotting smell of the swamp made that stream seem unhallowed and
deadly.

I sat down and considered the matter.  Crocodiles had always terrified
me more than any created thing, and to be dragged by iron jaws to death
in that hideous stream seemed to me the most awful of endings.  Yet
cross it I must if I were to get rid of my human enemies.  I remembered
a story of an escaped prisoner during the war who had only the Komati
River between him and safety.  But he dared not enter it, and was
recaptured by a Boer commando.  I was determined that such cowardice
should not be laid to my charge.  If I was to die, I would at least
have given myself every chance of life. So I braced myself as best I
could, and looked for a place to enter.

The veld-craft I had mastered had taught me a few things. One was that
wild animals drink at night, and that they have regular drinking
places.  I thought that the likeliest place for crocodiles was at or
around such spots, and, therefore, I resolved to take the water away
from a drinking place.  I went up the bank, noting where the narrow
bush-paths emerged on the water-side.  I scared away several little
buck, and once the violent commotion in the bush showed that I had
frightened some bigger animal, perhaps a hartebeest.  Still following
the bank I came to a reach where the undergrowth was unbroken and the
water looked deeper.

Suddenly--I fear I must use this adverb often, for all the happenings
on that night were sudden--I saw a biggish animal break through the
reeds on the far side.  It entered the water and, whether wading or
swimming I could not see, came out a little distance.  Then some sense
must have told it of my presence, for it turned and with a grunt made
its way back.

I saw that it was a big wart-hog, and began to think.  Pig, unlike
other beasts, drink not at night, but in the daytime. The hog had,
therefore, not come to drink, but to swim across. Now, I argued, he
would choose a safe place, for the wart-hog, hideous though he is, is a
wise beast.  What was safe for him would, therefore, in all likelihood
be safe for me.

With this hope to comfort me I prepared to enter.  My first care was
the jewels, so, feeling them precarious in my shirt, I twined the
collar round my neck and clasped it.  The snake-clasp was no flimsy
device of modern jewellery, and I had no fear but that it would hold.
I held the pistol between my teeth, and with a prayer to God slipped
into the muddy waters.

I swam in the wild way of a beginner who fears cramp.  The current was
light and the water moderately warm, but I seemed to go very slowly,
and I was cold with apprehension.  In the middle it suddenly shallowed,
and my breast came against a mudshoal.  I thought it was a crocodile,
and in my confusion the pistol dropped from my mouth and disappeared.

I waded a few steps and then plunged into deep water again. Almost
before I knew, I was among the bulrushes, with my feet in the slime of
the bank.  With feverish haste I scrambled through the reeds and up
through roots and undergrowth to the hard soil.  I was across, but,
alas, I had lost my only weapon.

The swim and the anxiety had tired me considerably, and though it meant
delay, I did not dare to continue with the weight of water-logged
clothes to impede me.  I found a dry sheltered place in the bush and
stripped to the skin.  I emptied my boots and wrung out my shirt and
breeches, while the Prester's jewels were blazing on my neck.  Here was
a queer counterpart to Laputa in the cave!

The change revived me, and I continued my way in better form.  So far
there had been no sign of pursuit.  Before me the Letsitela was the
only other stream, and from what I remembered of its character near the
Berg I thought I should have little trouble.  It was smaller than the
Klein Letaba, and a rushing torrent where shallows must be common.

I kept running till I felt my shirt getting dry on my back. Then I
restored the jewels to their old home, and found their cool touch on my
breast very comforting.  The country was getting more broken as I
advanced.  Little kopjes with thickets of wild bananas took the place
of the dead levels.  Long before I reached the Letsitela, I saw that I
was right in my guess.  It ran, a brawling mountain stream, in a narrow
rift in the bush. I crossed it almost dry-shod on the boulders above a
little fall, stopping for a moment to drink and lave my brow.

After that the country changed again.  The wood was now getting like
that which clothed the sides of the Berg.  There were tall
timber-trees--yellowwood, sneezewood, essenwood, stinkwood--and the
ground was carpeted with thick grass and ferns.  The sight gave me my
first earnest of safety.  I was approaching my own country.  Behind me
was heathendom and the black fever flats.  In front were the cool
mountains and bright streams, and the guns of my own folk.

As I struggled on--for I was getting very footsore and weary--I became
aware of an odd sound in my rear.  It was as if something were
following me.  I stopped and listened with a sudden dread.  Could
Laputa's trackers have got up with me already?  But the sound was not
of human feet.  It was as if some heavy animal were plunging through
the undergrowth. At intervals came the soft pad of its feet on the
grass.

It must be the hungry lion of my nightmare, and Henriques' pistol was
in the mud of the Klein Letaba!  The only thing was a tree, and I had
sprung for one and scrambled wearily into the first branches when a
great yellow animal came into the moonlight.

Providence had done kindly in robbing me of my pistol.  The next minute
I was on the ground with Colin leaping on me and baying with joy.  I
hugged that blessed hound and buried my head in his shaggy neck,
sobbing like a child.  How he had traced me I can never tell.  The
secret belongs only to the Maker of good and faithful dogs.

With him by my side I was a new man.  The awesome loneliness had gone.
I felt as if he were a message from my own people to take me safely
home.  He clearly knew the business afoot, for he padded beside me with
never a glance to right or left.  Another time he would have been
snowking in every thicket; but now he was on duty, a serious,
conscientious dog with no eye but for business.

The moon went down, and the starry sky was our only light. The thick
gloom which brooded over the landscape pointed to the night being far
gone.  I thought I saw a deeper blackness ahead which might be the line
of the Berg.  Then came that period of utter stillness when every bush
sound is hushed and the world seems to swoon.  I felt almost impious
hurrying through that profound silence, when not even the leaves
stirred or a frog croaked.

Suddenly as we came over a rise a little wind blew on the back of my
head, and a bitter chill came into the air.  I knew from nights spent
in the open that it was the precursor of dawn.  Sure enough, as I
glanced back, far over the plain a pale glow was stealing upwards into
the sky.  In a few minutes the pall melted into an airy haze, and above
me I saw the heavens shot with tremors of blue light.  Then the
foreground began to clear, and there before me, with their heads still
muffled in vapour, were the mountains.

Xenophon's Ten Thousand did not hail the sea more gladly than I
welcomed those frowning ramparts of the Berg.

Once again my weariness was eased.  I cried to Colin, and together we
ran down into the wide, shallow trough which lies at the foot of the
hills.  As the sun rose above the horizon, the black masses changed to
emerald and rich umber, and the fleecy mists of the summits opened and
revealed beyond shining spaces of green.  Some lines of Shakespeare ran
in my head, which I have always thought the most beautiful of all
poetry:

     'Night's candles are burned out, and jocund day
     Walks tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.'

Up there among the clouds was my salvation.  Like the Psalmist, I
lifted my eyes to the hills from whence came my aid.

Hope is a wonderful restorative.  To be near the hills, to smell their
odours, to see at the head of the glens the lines of the plateau where
were white men and civilization--all gave me new life and courage.
Colin saw my mood, and spared a moment now and then to inspect a hole
or a covert.  Down in the shallow trough I saw the links of a burn, the
Machudi, which flowed down the glen it was my purpose to ascend. Away
to the north in the direction of Majinje's were patches of Kaffir
tillage, and I thought I discerned the smoke from fires. Majinje's
womankind would be cooking their morning meal. To the south ran a thick
patch of forest, but I saw beyond it the spur of the mountain over
which runs the highroad to Wesselsburg.  The clear air of dawn was like
wine in my blood. I was not free, but I was on the threshold of
freedom.  If I could only reach my friends with the Prester's collar in
my shirt, I would have performed a feat which would never be forgotten.
I would have made history by my glorious folly. Breakfastless and
footsore, I was yet a proud man as I crossed the hollow to the mouth of
Machudi's glen.

My chickens had been counted too soon, and there was to be no hatching.
Colin grew uneasy, and began to sniff up wind.  I was maybe a quarter
of a mile from the glen foot, plodding through the long grass of the
hollow, when the behaviour of the dog made me stop and listen.  In that
still air sounds carry far, and I seemed to hear the noise of feet
brushing through cover.  The noise came both from north and south, from
the forest and from the lower course of the Machudi.

I dropped into shelter, and running with bent back got to the summit of
a little bush-clad knoll.  It was Colin who first caught sight of my
pursuers.  He was staring at a rift in the trees, and suddenly gave a
short bark.  I looked and saw two men, running hard, cross the grass
and dip into the bed of the stream.  A moment later I had a glimpse of
figures on the edge of the forest, moving fast to the mouth of the
glen.  The pursuit had not followed me; it had waited to cut me off.
Fool that I was, I had forgotten the wonders of Kaffir telegraphy.  It
had been easy for Laputa to send word thirty miles ahead to stop any
white man who tried to cross the Berg.

And then I knew that I was very weary.



CHAPTER XV

MORNING IN THE BERG

I was perhaps half a mile the nearer to the glen, and was likely to get
there first.  And after that?  I could see the track winding by the
waterside and then crossing a hill-shoulder which diverted the stream.
It was a road a man could scarcely ride, and a tired man would have a
hard job to climb.  I do not think that I had any hope.  My
exhilaration had died as suddenly as it had been born.  I saw myself
caught and carried off to Laputa, who must now be close on the
rendezvous at Inanda's Kraal.  I had no weapon to make a fight for it.
My foemen were many and untired.  It must be only a matter of minutes
till I was in their hands.

More in a dogged fury of disappointment than with any hope of escape I
forced my sore legs up the glen.  Ten minutes ago I had been exulting
in the glories of the morning, and now the sun was not less bright or
the colours less fair, but the heart had gone out of the spectator.  At
first I managed to get some pace out of myself, partly from fear and
partly from anger.  But I soon found that my body had been tried too
far. I could plod along, but to save my life I could not have hurried.
Any healthy savage could have caught me in a hundred yards.

The track, I remember, was overhung with creepers, and often I had to
squeeze through thickets of tree-ferns.  Countless little brooks ran
down from the hillside, threads of silver among the green pastures.
Soon I left the stream and climbed up on the shoulder, where the road
was not much better than a precipice.  Every step was a weariness.  I
could hardly drag one foot after the other, and my heart was beating
like the fanners of a mill, I had spasms of acute sickness, and it took
all my resolution to keep me from lying down by the roadside.

At last I was at the top of the shoulder and could look back. There was
no sign of anybody on the road so far as I could see.  Could I have
escaped them?  I had been in the shadow of the trees for the first
part, and they might have lost sight of me and concluded that I had
avoided the glen or tried one of the faces.  Before me, I remember,
there stretched the upper glen, a green cup-shaped hollow with the
sides scarred by ravines. There was a high waterfall in one of them
which was white as snow against the red rocks.  My wits must have been
shaky, for I took the fall for a snowdrift, and wondered sillily why
the Berg had grown so Alpine.

A faint spasm of hope took me into that green cup.  The bracken was as
thick as on the Pentlands, and there was a multitude of small lovely
flowers in the grass.  It was like a water-meadow at home, such a place
as I had often in boyhood searched for moss-cheepers' and corncrakes'
eggs.  Birds were crying round me as I broke this solitude, and one
small buck--a klipspringer--rose from my feet and dashed up one of the
gullies.  Before me was a steep green wall with the sky blue above it.
Beyond it was safety, but as my sweat-dimmed eyes looked at it I knew
that I could never reach it.

Then I saw my pursuers.  High up on the left side, and rounding the rim
of the cup, were little black figures.  They had not followed my trail,
but, certain of my purpose, had gone forward to intercept me.  I
remember feeling a puny weakling compared with those lusty natives who
could make such good going on steep mountains.  They were certainly no
men of the plains, but hillmen, probably some remnants of old Machudi's
tribe who still squatted in the glen.  Machudi was a blackguard chief
whom the Boers long ago smashed in one of their native wars.  He was a
fierce old warrior and had put up a good fight to the last, till a
hired impi of Swazis had surrounded his hiding-place in the forest and
destroyed him.  A Boer farmer on the plateau had his skull, and used to
drink whisky out of it when he was merry.

The sight of the pursuit was the last straw.  I gave up hope, and my
intentions were narrowed to one frantic desire--to hide the jewels.
Patriotism, which I had almost forgotten, flickered up in that crisis.
At any rate Laputa should not have the Snake.  If he drove out the
white man, he should not clasp the Prester's rubies on his great neck.

There was no cover in the green cup, so I turned up the ravine on the
right side.  The enemy, so far as I could judge, were on the left and
in front, and in the gully I might find a pot-hole to bury the necklet
in.  Only a desperate resolution took me through the tangle of juniper
bushes into the red screes of the gully.  At first I could not find
what I sought.  The stream in the ravine slid down a long slope like a
mill-race, and the sides were bare and stony.  Still I plodded on,
helping myself with a hand on Colin's back, for my legs were numb with
fatigue.  By-and-by the gully narrowed, and I came to a flat place with
a long pool.  Beyond was a little fall, and up this I climbed into a
network of tiny cascades.  Over one pool hung a dead tree-fern, and a
bay from it ran into a hole of the rock. I slipped the jewels far into
the hole, where they lay on the firm sand, showing odd lights through
the dim blue water. Then I scrambled down again to the flat space and
the pool, and looked round to see if any one had reached the edge of
the ravine.  There was no sign as yet of the pursuit, so I dropped
limply on the shingle and waited.  For I had suddenly conceived a plan.

As my breath came back to me my wits came back from their wandering.
These men were not there to kill me, but to capture me.  They could
know nothing of the jewels, for Laputa would never have dared to make
the loss of the sacred Snake public.  Therefore they would not suspect
what I had done, and would simply lead me to Laputa at Inanda's Kraal.
I began to see the glimmerings of a plan for saving my life, and by
God's grace, for saving my country from the horrors of rebellion.  The
more I thought the better I liked it.  It demanded a bold front, and it
might well miscarry, but I had taken such desperate hazards during the
past days that I was less afraid of fortune.  Anyhow, the choice lay
between certain death and a slender chance of life, and it was easy to
decide.

Playing football, I used to notice how towards the end of a game I
might be sore and weary, without a kick in my body; but when I had a
straight job of tackling a man my strength miraculously returned.  It
was even so now.  I lay on my side, luxuriating in being still, and
slowly a sort of vigour crept back into my limbs.  Perhaps a half-hour
of rest was given me before, on the lip of the gully, I saw figures
appear.  Looking down I saw several men who had come across from the
opposite side of the valley, scrambling up the stream.  I got to my
feet, with Colin bristling beside me, and awaited them with the
stiffest face I could muster.

As I expected, they were Machudi's men.  I recognized them by the red
ochre in their hair and their copper-wire necklets. Big fellows they
were, long-legged and deep in the chest, the true breed of
mountaineers.  I admired their light tread on the slippery rock.  It
was hopeless to think of evading such men in their own hills.

The men from the side joined the men in front, and they stood looking
at me from about twelve yards off.  They were armed only with
knobkerries, and very clearly were no part of Laputa's army.  This made
their errand plain to me.

'Halt!' I said in Kaffir, as one of them made a hesitating step to
advance.  'Who are you and what do you seek?'

There was no answer, but they looked at me curiously. Then one made a
motion with his stick.  Colin gave a growl, and would have been on him
if I had not kept a hand on his collar. The rash man drew back, and all
stood stiff and perplexed.

'Keep your hands by your side,' I said, 'or the dog, who has a devil,
will devour you.  One of you speak for the rest and tell me your
purpose.'

For a moment I had a wild notion that they might be friends, some of
Arcoll's scouts, and out to help me.  But the first words shattered the
fancy.

'We are sent by Inkulu,' the biggest of them said.  'He bade us bring
you to him.'

'And what if I refuse to go?'

'Then, Baas, we must take you to him.  We are under the vow of the
Snake.'

'Vow of fiddlestick!' I cried.  'Who do you think is the bigger chief,
the Inkulu or Ratitswan?  I tell you Ratitswan is now driving Inkulu
before him as a wind drives rotten leaves.  It will be well for you,
men of Machudi, to make peace with Ratitswan and take me to him on the
Berg.  If you bring me to him, I and he will reward you; but if you do
Inkulu's bidding you will soon be hunted like buck out of your hills.'

They grinned at one another, but I could see that my words had no
effect.  Laputa had done his business too well.

The spokesman shrugged his shoulders in the way the Kaffirs have. 'We
wish you no ill, Baas, but we have been bidden to take you to Inkulu.
We cannot disobey the command of the Snake.'

My weakness was coming on me again, and I could talk no more.  I sat
down plump on the ground, almost falling into the pool.  'Take me to
Inkulu,' I stammered with a dry throat, 'I do not fear him;' and I
rolled half-fainting on my back.

These clansmen of Machudi were decent fellows.  One of them had some
Kaffir beer in a calabash, which he gave me to drink.  The stuff was
thin and sickly, but the fermentation in it did me good.  I had the
sense to remember my need of sleep. 'The day is young,' I said, 'and I
have come far.  I ask to be allowed to sleep for an hour.'

The men made no difficulty, and with my head between Colin's paws I
slipped into dreamless slumber.

When they wakened me the sun was beginning to climb the sky, I judged
it to be about eight o'clock.  They had made a little fire and roasted
mealies.  Some of the food they gave me, and I ate it thankfully.  I
was feeling better, and I think a pipe would have almost completed my
cure.

But when I stood up I found that I was worse than I had thought.  The
truth is, I was leg-weary, which you often see in horses, but rarely in
men.  What the proper explanation is I do not know, but the muscles
simply refuse to answer the direction of the will.  I found my legs
sprawling like a child's who is learning to walk.

'If you want me to go to the Inkulu, you must carry me,' I said, as I
dropped once more on the ground.

The men nodded, and set to work to make a kind of litter out of their
knobkerries and some old ropes they carried.  As they worked and
chattered I looked idly at the left bank of the ravine--that is, the
left as you ascend it.  Some of Machudi's men had come down there, and,
though the place looked sheer and perilous, I saw how they had managed
it.  I followed out bit by bit the track upwards, not with any thought
of escape, but merely to keep my mind under control.  The right road
was from the foot of the pool up a long shelf to a clump of juniper.
Then there was an easy chimney; then a piece of good hand-and-foot
climbing; and last, another ledge which led by an easy gradient to the
top.  I figured all this out as I have heard a condemned man will count
the windows of the houses on his way to the scaffold.

Presently the litter was ready, and the men made signs to me to get
into it.  They carried me down the ravine and up the Machudi burn to
the green walls at its head.  I admired their bodily fitness, for they
bore me up those steep slopes with never a halt, zigzagging in the
proper style of mountain transport.  In less than an hour we had topped
the ridge, and the plateau was before me.

It looked very homelike and gracious, rolling in gentle undulations to
the western horizon, with clumps of wood in its hollows.  Far away I
saw smoke rising from what should be the village of the Iron Kranz.  It
was the country of my own people, and my captors behoved to go
cautiously.  They were old hands at veld-craft, and it was wonderful
the way in which they kept out of sight even on the bare ridges.
Arcoll could have taught them nothing in the art of scouting.  At an
incredible pace they hurried me along, now in a meadow by a stream
side, now through a patch of forest, and now skirting a green shoulder
of hill.

Once they clapped down suddenly, and crawled into the lee of some thick
bracken.  Then very quietly they tied my hands and feet, and, not
urgently, wound a dirty length of cotton over my mouth.  Colin was
meantime held tight and muzzled with a kind of bag strapped over his
head.  To get this over his snapping jaws took the whole strength of
the party.  I guessed that we were nearing the highroad which runs from
the plateau down the Great Letaba valley to the mining township of
Wesselsburg, away out on the plain.  The police patrols must be on this
road, and there was risk in crossing.  Sure enough I seemed to catch a
jingle of bridles as if from some company of men riding in haste.

We lay still for a little till the scouts came back and reported the
coast clear.  Then we made a dart for the road, crossed it, and got
into cover on the other side, where the ground sloped down to the
Letaba glen.  I noticed in crossing that the dust of the highway was
thick with the marks of shod horses.  I was very near and yet very far
from my own people.

Once in the rocky gorge of the Letaba we advanced with less care.  We
scrambled up a steep side gorge and came on to the small plateau from
which the Cloud Mountains rise.  After that I was so tired that I
drowsed away, heedless of the bumping of the litter.  We went up and
up, and when I next opened my eyes we had gone through a pass into a
hollow of the hills. There was a flat space a mile or two square, and
all round it stern black ramparts of rock.  This must be Inanda's
Kraal, a strong place if ever one existed, for a few men could defend
all the approaches.  Considering that I had warned Arcoll of this
rendezvous, I marvelled that no attempt had been made to hold the
entrance.  The place was impregnable unless guns were brought up to the
heights.  I remember thinking of a story I had heard--how in the war
Beyers took his guns into the Wolkberg, and thereby saved them from our
troops.  Could Arcoll be meditating the same exploit?

Suddenly I heard the sound of loud voices, and my litter was dropped
roughly on the ground.  I woke to clear consciousness in the midst of
pandemonium.



CHAPTER XVI

INANDA'S KRAAL

The vow was at an end.  In place of the silent army of yesterday a mob
of maddened savages surged around me.  They were chanting a wild song,
and brandishing spears and rifles to its accompaniment.  From their
bloodshot eyes stared the lust of blood, the fury of conquest, and all
the aboriginal passions on which Laputa had laid his spell.  In my mind
ran a fragment from Laputa's prayer in the cave about the 'Terrible
Ones.' Machudi's men--stout fellows, they held their ground as long as
they could--were swept out of the way, and the wave of black savagery
seemed to close over my head.

I thought my last moment had come.  Certainly it had but for Colin.
The bag had been taken from his head, and the fellow of Machudi's had
dropped the rope round his collar.  In a red fury of wrath the dog
leaped at my enemies.  Though every man of them was fully armed, they
fell back, for I have noticed always that Kaffirs are mortally afraid
of a white man's dog.  Colin had the sense to keep beside me.  Growling
like a thunderstorm he held the ring around my litter.

The breathing space would not have lasted long, but it gave me time to
get to my feet.  My wrists and feet had been unbound long before, and
the rest had cured my leg-weariness. I stood up in that fierce circle
with the clear knowledge that my life hung by a hair.

'Take me to Inkulu,' I cried.  'Dogs and fools, would you despise his
orders?  If one hair of my head is hurt, he will flay you alive.  Show
me the way to him, and clear out of it.'

I dare say there was a break in my voice, for I was dismally
frightened, but there must have been sufficient authority to get me a
hearing.  Machudi's men closed up behind me, and repeated my words with
flourishes and gestures.  But still the circle held.  No man came
nearer me, but none moved so as to give me passage.

Then I screwed up my courage, and did the only thing possible.  I
walked straight into the circle, knowing well that I was running no
light risk.  My courage, as I have already explained, is of little use
unless I am doing something.  I could not endure another minute of
sitting still with those fierce eyes on me.

The circle gave way.  Sullenly they made a road for me, closing up
behind on my guards, so that Machudi's men were swallowed in the mob,
Alone I stalked forward with all that huge yelling crowd behind me.

I had not far to go.  Inanda's Kraal was a cluster of kyas and
rondavels, shaped in a half-moon, with a flat space between the houses,
where grew a big merula tree.  All around was a medley of little fires,
with men squatted beside them. Here and there a party had finished
their meal, and were swaggering about with a great shouting.  The mob
into which I had fallen was of this sort, and I saw others within the
confines of the camp.  But around the merula tree there was a gathering
of chiefs, if I could judge by the comparative quiet and dignity of the
men, who sat in rows on the ground.  A few were standing, and among
them I caught sight of Laputa's tall figure.  I strode towards it,
wondering if the chiefs would let me pass.

The hubbub of my volunteer attendants brought the eyes of the company
round to me.  In a second it seemed every man was on his feet.  I could
only pray that Laputa would get to me before his friends had time to
spear me.  I remember I fixed my eyes on a spur of hill beyond the
kraal, and walked on with the best resolution I could find.  Already I
felt in my breast some of the long thin assegais of Umbooni's men.

But Laputa did not intend that I should be butchered.  A word from him
brought his company into order, and the next thing I knew I was facing
him, where he stood in front of the biggest kya, with Henriques beside
him, and some of the northern indunas.  Henriques looked ghastly in the
clear morning light, and he had a linen rag bound round his head and
jaw, as if he suffered from toothache.  His face was more livid, his
eyes more bloodshot, and at the sight of me his hand went to his belt,
and his teeth snapped.  But he held his peace, and it was Laputa who
spoke.  He looked straight through me, and addressed Machudi's men.

'You have brought back the prisoner.  That is well, and your service
will be remembered.  Go to 'Mpefu's camp on the hill there, and you
will be given food.'

The men departed, and with them fell away the crowd which had followed
me.  I was left, very giddy and dazed, to confront Laputa and his
chiefs.  The whole scene was swimming before my eyes.  I remember there
was a clucking of hens from somewhere behind the kraal, which called up
ridiculous memories.  I was trying to remember the plan I had made in
Machudi's glen.  I kept saying to myself like a parrot: 'The army
cannot know about the jewels.  Laputa must keep his loss secret.  I can
get my life from him if I offer to give them back.' It had sounded a
good scheme three hours before, but with the man's hard face before me,
it seemed a frail peg to hang my fate on.

Laputa's eye fell on me, a clear searching eye with a question in it.

There was something he was trying to say to me which he dared not put
into words.  I guessed what the something was, for I saw his glance run
over my shirt and my empty pockets.

'You have made little of your treachery,' he said.  'Fool, did you
think to escape me?  I could bring you back from the ends of the earth.'

'There was no treachery,' I replied.  'Do you blame a prisoner for
trying to escape?  When shooting began I found myself free, and I took
the road for home.  Ask Machudi's men and they will tell you that I
came quietly with them, when I saw that the game was up.'

He shrugged his shoulders.  'It matters very little what you did.  You
are here now.--  Tie him up and put him in my kya,' he said to the
bodyguard.  'I have something to say to him before he dies.'

As the men laid hands on me, I saw the exultant grin on Henriques'
face.  It was more than I could endure.

'Stop,' I said.  'You talk of traitors, Mr Laputa.  There is the
biggest and blackest at your elbow.  That man sent word to Arcoll about
your crossing at Dupree's Drift.  At our outspan at noon yesterday he
came to me and offered me my liberty if I would help him.  He told me
he was a spy, and I flung his offer in his face.  It was he who shot
the Keeper by the river side, and would have stolen the Snake if I had
not broken his head.  You call me a traitor, and you let that thing
live, though he has killed your priest and betrayed your plans.  Kill
me if you like, but by God let him die first.'

I do not know how the others took the revelation, for my eyes were only
for the Portugoose.  He made a step towards me, his hands twitching by
his sides.

'You lie,' he screamed in that queer broken voice which much fever
gives.  'It was this English hound that killed the Keeper, and felled
me when I tried to save him.  The man who insults my honour is dead.'
And he plucked from his belt a pistol.

A good shot does not miss at two yards.  I was never nearer my end than
in that fraction of time while the weapon came up to the aim.  It was
scarcely a second, but it was enough for Colin.  The dog had kept my
side, and had stood docilely by me while Laputa spoke.  The truth is,
he must have been as tired as I was.  As the Kaffirs approached to lay
hands on me he had growled menacingly, but when I spoke again he had
stopped.  Henriques' voice had convinced him of a more urgent danger,
and so soon as the trigger hand of the Portugoose rose, the dog sprang.
The bullet went wide, and the next moment dog and man were struggling
on the ground.

A dozen hands held me from going to Colin's aid, but oddly enough no
one stepped forward to help Henriques.  The ruffian kept his head, and
though the dog's teeth were in his shoulder, he managed to get his
right hand free.  I saw what would happen, and yelled madly in my
apprehension.  The yellow wrist curved, and the pistol barrel was
pressed below the dog's shoulder.  Thrice he fired, the grip relaxed,
and Colin rolled over limply, fragments of shirt still hanging from his
jaw.  The Portugoose rose slowly with his hand to his head, and a thin
stream of blood dripping from his shoulder. As I saw the faithful eyes
glazing in death, and knew that I had lost the best of all comrades, I
went clean berserk mad. The cluster of men round me, who had been
staring open-eyed at the fight, were swept aside like reeds.  I went
straight for the Portugoose, determined that, pistol or no pistol, I
would serve him as he had served my dog.

For my years I was a well-set-up lad, long in the arms and deep in the
chest.  But I had not yet come to my full strength, and in any case I
could not hope to fight the whole of Laputa's army.  I was flung back
and forwards like a shuttlecock.  They played some kind of game with
me, and I could hear the idiotic Kaffir laughter.  It was blind man's
buff, so far as I was concerned, for I was blind with fury.  I struck
out wildly left and right, beating the air often, but sometimes getting
in a solid blow on hard black flesh.  I was soundly beaten myself,
pricked with spears, and made to caper for savage sport. Suddenly I saw
Laputa before me, and hurled myself madly at his chest.  Some one gave
me a clout on the head, and my senses fled.


When I came to myself, I was lying on a heap of mealie-stalks in a dark
room.  I had a desperate headache, and a horrid nausea, which made me
fall back as soon as I tried to raise myself. A voice came out of the
darkness as I stirred--a voice speaking English.

'Are you awake, Mr Storekeeper?'

The voice was Laputa's, but I could not see him.  The room was pitch
dark, except for a long ray of sunlight on the floor.

'I'm awake,' I said.  'What do you want with me?'

Some one stepped out of the gloom and sat down near me. A naked black
foot broke the belt of light on the floor.

'For God's sake get me a drink,' I murmured. The figure rose and
fetched a pannikin of water from a pail. I could hear the cool trickle
of the drops on the metal.  A hand put the dish to my mouth, and I
drank water with a strong dash of spirits.  This brought back my
nausea, and I collapsed on the mealie-stalks till the fit passed. Again
the voice spoke, this time from close at hand.

'You are paying the penalty of being a fool, Mr Storekeeper. You are
young to die, but folly is common in youth.  In an hour you will regret
that you did not listen to my advice at Umvelos'.'

I clawed at my wits and strove to realize what he was saying. He spoke
of death within an hour.  If it only came sharp and sudden, I did not
mind greatly.  The plan I had made had slipped utterly out of my mind.
My body was so wretched, that I asked only for rest.  I was very
lighthearted and foolish at that moment.

'Kill me if you like,' I whispered.  'Some day you will pay dearly for
it all.  But for God's sake go away and leave me alone.'

Laputa laughed.  It was a horrid sound in the darkness.

'You are brave, Mr Storekeeper, but I have seen a brave man's courage
ebb very fast when he saw the death which I have arranged for you.
Would you like to hear something of it by way of preparation?'

In a low gentle voice he began to tell me mysteries of awful cruelty.
At first I scarcely heard him, but as he went on my brain seemed to
wake from its lethargy.  I listened with freezing blood.  Not in my
wildest nightmares had I imagined such a fate.  Then in despite of
myself a cry broke from me.

'It interests you?' Laputa asked.  'I could tell you more, but
something must be left to the fancy.  Yours should be an active one,'
and his hand gripped my shaking wrist and felt my pulse.

'Henriques will see that the truth does not fall short of my forecast,'
he went on.  'For I have appointed Henriques your executioner.'

The name brought my senses back to me.

'Kill me,' I said, 'but for God's sake kill Henriques too.  If you did
justice you would let me go and roast the Portugoose alive.  But for me
the Snake would be over the Lebombo by this time in Henriques' pocket.'

'But it is not, my friend.  It was stolen by a storekeeper, who will
shortly be wishing he had died in his mother's womb.'

My plan was slowly coming back to me.

'If you value Prester John's collar, you will save my life. What will
your rising be without the Snake?  Would they follow you a yard if they
suspected you had lost it?'

'So you would threaten me,' Laputa said very gently.  Then in a burst
of wrath he shouted, 'They will follow me to hell for my own sake.
Imbecile, do you think my power is built on a trinket?  When you are in
your grave, I will be ruling a hundred millions from the proudest
throne on earth.'

He sprang to his feet, and pulled back a shutter of the window, letting
a flood of light into the hut.  In that light I saw that he had in his
hands the ivory box which had contained the collar.

'I will carry the casket through the wars,' he cried, 'and if I choose
never to open it, who will gainsay me?  You besotted fool, to think
that any theft of yours could hinder my destiny!' He was the blustering
savage again, and I preferred him in the part.  All that he said might
be true, but I thought I could detect in his voice a keen regret, and
in his air a touch of disquiet.  The man was a fanatic, and like all
fanatics had his superstitions.

'Yes,' I said, 'but when you mount the throne you speak of, it would be
a pity not to have the rubies on your neck after all your talk in the
cave.'

I thought he would have throttled me.  He glowered down at me with
murder in his eyes.  Then he dashed the casket on the floor with such
violence that it broke into fragments.

'Give me back the _Ndhlondhlo_,' he cried, like a petted child. 'Give me
back the collar of John.'

This was the moment I had been waiting for.

'Now see here, Mr Laputa,' I said.  'I am going to talk business.
Before you started this rising, you were a civilized man with a good
education.  Well, just remember that education for a minute, and look
at the matter in a sensible light. I'm not like the Portugoose.  I
don't want to steal your rubies. I swear to God that what I have told
you is true.  Henriques killed the priest, and would have bagged the
jewels if I had not laid him out.  I ran away because I was going to be
killed to-day, and I took the collar to keep it out of Henriques'
hands.  I tell you I would never have shot the old man myself.  Very
well, what happened?  Your men overtook me, and I had no choice but to
surrender.  Before they reached me, I hid the collar in a place I know
of.  Now, I am going to make you a fair and square business
proposition.  You may be able to get on without the Snake, but I can
see you want it back.  I am in a tight place and want nothing so much
as my life.  I offer to trade with you.  Give me my life, and I will
take you to the place and put the jewels in your hand.  Otherwise you
may kill me, but you will never see the collar of John again.'

I still think that was a pretty bold speech for a man to make in a
predicament like mine.  But it had its effect.  Laputa ceased to be the
barbarian king, and talked like a civilized man.

'That is, as you call it, a business proposition.  But supposing I
refuse it?  Supposing I take measures here--in this kraal--to make you
speak, and then send for the jewels.'

'There are several objections,' I said, quite cheerfully, for I felt
that I was gaining ground.  'One is that I could not explain to any
mortal soul how to find the collar.  I know where it is, but I could
not impart the knowledge.  Another is that the country between here and
Machudi's is not very healthy for your people.  Arcoll's men are all
over it, and you cannot have a collection of search parties rummaging
about in the glen for long.  Last and most important, if you send any
one for the jewels, you confess their loss.  No, Mr Laputa, if you want
them back, you must go yourself and take me with you.'

He stood silent for a little, with his brows knit in thought. Then he
opened the door and went out.  I guessed that he had gone to discover
from his scouts the state of the country between Inanda's Kraal and
Machudi's glen.  Hope had come back to me, and I sat among the
mealie-stalks trying to plan the future.  If he made a bargain I
believed he would keep it. Once set free at the head of Machudi's, I
should be within an hour or two of Arcoll's posts.  So far, I had done
nothing for the cause.  My message had been made useless by Henriques'
treachery, and I had stolen the Snake only to restore it.  But if I got
off with my life, there would be work for me to do in the Armageddon
which I saw approaching.  Should I escape, I wondered.  What would
hinder Laputa from setting his men to follow me, and seize me before I
could get into safety?  My only chance was that Arcoll might have been
busy this day, and the countryside too full of his men to let Laputa's
Kaffirs through.  But if this was so, Laputa and I should be stopped,
and then Laputa would certainly kill me.  I wished--and yet I did not
wish--that Arcoll should hold all approaches.  As I reflected, my first
exhilaration died away.  The scales were still heavily weighted against
me.

Laputa returned, closing the door behind him.

'I will bargain with you on my own terms.  You shall have your life,
and in return you will take me to the place where you hid the collar,
and put it into my hands.  I will ride there, and you will run beside
me, tied to my saddle.  If we are in danger from the white men, I will
shoot you dead.  Do you accept?'

'Yes,' I said, scrambling to my feet, and ruefully testing my shaky
legs.  'But if you want me to get to Machudi's you must go slowly, for
I am nearly foundered.'

Then he brought out a Bible, and made me swear on it that I would do as
I promised.

'Swear to me in turn,' I said, 'that you will give me my life if I
restore the jewels.'

He swore, kissing the book like a witness in a police-court.  I had
forgotten that the man called himself a Christian.

'One thing more I ask,' I said.  'I want my dog decently buried.' 'That
has been already done,' was the reply.  'He was a brave animal, and my
people honour bravery.'



CHAPTER XVII

A DEAL AND ITS CONSEQUENCES

My eyes were bandaged tight, and a thong was run round my right wrist
and tied to Laputa's saddle-bow.  I felt the glare of the afternoon sun
on my head, and my shins were continually barked by stones and trees;
but these were my only tidings of the outer world.  By the sound of his
paces Laputa was riding the _schimmel_, and if any one thinks it easy to
go blindfold by a horse's side I hope he will soon have the experience.
In the darkness I could not tell the speed of the beast.  When I ran I
overshot it and was tugged back; when I walked my wrist was dislocated
with the tugs forward.

For an hour or more I suffered this breakneck treatment. We were
descending.  Often I could hear the noise of falling streams, and once
we splashed through a mountain ford. Laputa was taking no risks, for he
clearly had in mind the possibility of some accident which would set me
free, and he had no desire to have me guiding Arcoll to his camp.

But as I stumbled and sprawled down these rocky tracks I was not
thinking of Laputa's plans.  My whole soul was filled with regret for
Colin, and rage against his murderer.  After my first mad rush I had
not thought about my dog.  He was dead, but so would I be in an hour or
two, and there was no cause to lament him.  But at the first revival of
hope my grief had returned.  As they bandaged my eyes I was wishing
that they would let me see his grave.  As I followed beside Laputa I
told myself that if ever I got free, when the war was over I would go
to Inanda's Kraal, find the grave, and put a tombstone over it in
memory of the dog that saved my life.  I would also write that the man
who shot him was killed on such and such a day at such and such a place
by Colin's master.  I wondered why Laputa had not the wits to see the
Portugoose's treachery and to let me fight him.  I did not care what
were the weapons--knives or guns, or naked fists--I would certainly
kill him, and afterwards the Kaffirs could do as they pleased with me.
Hot tears of rage and weakness wet the bandage on my eyes, and the sobs
which came from me were not only those of weariness.

At last we halted.  Laputa got down and took off the bandage, and I
found myself in one of the hill-meadows which lie among the foothills
of the Wolkberg.  The glare blinded me, and for a little I could only
see the marigolds growing at my feet.  Then I had a glimpse of the deep
gorge of the Great Letaba below me, and far to the east the flats
running out to the hazy blue line of the Lebombo hills.  Laputa let me
sit on the ground for a minute or two to get my breath and rest my
feet.  'That was a rough road,' he said.  'You can take it easier now,
for I have no wish to carry you.'  He patted the _schimmel_, and the
beautiful creature turned his mild eyes on the pair of us.  I wondered
if he recognized his rider of two nights ago.

I had seen Laputa as the Christian minister, as the priest and king in
the cave, as the leader of an army at Dupree's Drift, and at the kraal
we had left as the savage with all self-control flung to the winds.  I
was to see this amazing man in a further part.  For he now became a
friendly and rational companion.  He kept his horse at an easy walk,
and talked to me as if we were two friends out for a trip together.
Perhaps he had talked thus to Arcoll, the half-caste who drove his
Cape-cart.

The wooded bluff above Machudi's glen showed far in front.  He told me
the story of the Machudi war, which I knew already, but he told it as a
saga.  There had been a stratagem by which one of the Boer leaders--a
Grobelaar, I think--got some of his men into the enemy's camp by hiding
them in a captured forage wagon.

'Like the Trojan horse,' I said involuntarily.

'Yes,' said my companion, 'the same old device,' and to my amazement he
quoted some lines of Virgil.

'Do you understand Latin?' he asked.

I told him that I had some slight knowledge of the tongue, acquired at
the university of Edinburgh.  Laputa nodded.  He mentioned the name of
a professor there, and commented on his scholarship.

'O man!' I cried, 'what in God's name are you doing in this business?
You that are educated and have seen the world, what makes you try to
put the clock back?  You want to wipe out the civilization of a
thousand years, and turn us all into savages. It's the more shame to
you when you know better.'

'You misunderstand me,' he said quietly.  'It is because I have sucked
civilization dry that I know the bitterness of the fruit.  I want a
simpler and better world, and I want that world for my own people.  I
am a Christian, and will you tell me that your civilization pays much
attention to Christ?  You call yourself a patriot?  Will you not give
me leave to be a patriot in turn?'

'If you are a Christian, what sort of Christianity is it to deluge the
land with blood?'

'The best,' he said.  'The house must be swept and garnished before the
man of the house can dwell in it.  You have read history. Such a
purging has descended on the Church at many times, and the world has
awakened to a new hope.  It is the same in all religions.  The temples
grow tawdry and foul and must be cleansed, and, let me remind you, the
cleanser has always come out of the desert.'

I had no answer, being too weak and forlorn to think.  But I fastened
on his patriotic plea.

'Where are the patriots in your following?  They are all red Kaffirs
crying for blood and plunder.  Supposing you were Oliver Cromwell you
could make nothing out of such a crew.'

'They are my people,' he said simply.

By this time we had forded the Great Letaba, and were making our way
through the clumps of forest to the crown of the plateau.  I noticed
that Laputa kept well in cover, preferring the tangle of wooded
undergrowth to the open spaces of the water-meadows.  As he talked, his
wary eyes were keeping a sharp look-out over the landscape.  I thrilled
with the thought that my own folk were near at hand.

Once Laputa checked me with his hand as I was going to speak, and in
silence we crossed the kloof of a little stream. After that we struck a
long strip of forest and he slackened his watch.

'If you fight for a great cause,' I said, 'why do you let a miscreant
like Henriques have a hand in it?  You must know that the man's only
interest in you is the chance of loot.  I am for you against Henriques,
and I tell you plain that if you don't break the snake's back it will
sting you.'

Laputa looked at me with an odd, meditative look.

'You misunderstand again, Mr Storekeeper.  The Portuguese is what you
call a "mean white." His only safety is among us.  I am campaigner
enough to know that an enemy, who has a burning grievance against my
other enemies, is a good ally. You are too hard on Henriques.  You and
your friends have treated him as a Kaffir, and a Kaffir he is in
everything but Kaffir virtues.  What makes you so anxious that
Henriques should not betray me?'

'I'm not a mean white,' I said, 'and I will speak the truth.  I hope,
in God's name, to see you smashed; but I want it done by honest men,
and not by a yellow devil who has murdered my dog and my friends.
Sooner or later you will find him out; and if he escapes you, and
there's any justice in heaven, he won't escape me.'

'Brave words,' said Laputa, with a laugh, and then in one second he
became rigid in the saddle.  We had crossed a patch of meadow and
entered a wood, beyond which ran the highway. I fancy he was out in his
reckoning, and did not think the road so near.  At any rate, after a
moment he caught the sound of horses, and I caught it too.  The wood
was thin, and there was no room for retreat, while to recross the
meadow would bring us clean into the open.  He jumped from his horse,
untied with amazing quickness the rope halter from its neck, and
started to gag me by winding the thing round my jaw.

I had no time to protest that I would keep faith, and my right hand was
tethered to his pommel.  In the grip of these great arms I was
helpless, and in a trice was standing dumb as a lamp-post; while
Laputa, his left arm round both of mine, and his right hand over the
_schimmel_'s eyes, strained his ears like a sable antelope who has
scented danger.

There was never a more brutal gagging.  The rope crushed my nose and
drove my lips down on my teeth, besides gripping my throat so that I
could scarcely breathe.  The pain was so great that I became sick, and
would have fallen but for Laputa. Happily I managed to get my teeth
apart, so that one coil slipped between, and eased the pain of the
jaws.  But the rest was bad enough to make me bite frantically on the
tow, and I think in a little my sharp front teeth would have severed
it.  All this discomfort prevented me seeing what happened.  The wood,
as I have said, was thin, and through the screen of leaves I had a
confused impression of men and horses passing interminably.  There can
only have been a score at the most; but the moments drag if a cord is
gripping your throat.  When Laputa at length untied me, I had another
fit of nausea, and leaned helplessly against a tree.

Laputa listened till the sound of the horses had died away; then
silently we stole to the edge of the road, across, and into the thicker
evergreen bush on the far side.  At a pace which forced me to run hard,
we climbed a steepish slope, till ahead of us we saw the bald green
crown of the meadowlands.  I noticed that his face had grown dark and
sullen again.  He was in an enemy's country, and had the air of the
hunted instead of the hunter.  When I stopped he glowered at me, and
once, when I was all but overcome with fatigue, he lifted his hand in a
threat.  Had he carried a sjambok, it would have fallen on my back.

If he was nervous, so was I.  The fact that I was out of the Kaffir
country and in the land of my own folk was a kind of qualified liberty.
At any moment, I felt, Providence might intervene to set me free.  It
was in the bond that Laputa should shoot me if we were attacked; but a
pistol might miss.  As far as my shaken wits would let me, I began to
forecast the future. Once he got the jewels my side of the bargain was
complete. He had promised me my life, but there had been nothing said
about my liberty; and I felt assured that Laputa would never allow one
who had seen so much to get off to Arcoll with his tidings.  But back
to that unhallowed kraal I was resolved I would not go.  He was armed,
and I was helpless; he was strong, and I was dizzy with weakness; he
was mounted, and I was on foot: it seemed a poor hope that I should get
away. There was little chance from a wandering patrol, for I knew if we
were followed I should have a bullet in my head, while Laputa got off
on the _schimmel_.  I must wait and bide events. At the worst, a clean
shot on the hillside in a race for life was better than the unknown
mysteries of the kraal.  I prayed earnestly to God to show me His
mercy, for if ever man was sore bested by the heathen it was I.

To my surprise, Laputa chose to show himself on the green
hill-shoulder.  He looked towards the Wolkberg and raised his hands.
It must have been some signal.  I cast my eyes back on the road we had
come, and I thought I saw some figures a mile back, on the edge of the
Letaba gorge.  He was making sure of my return.

By this time it was about four in the afternoon, and as heavenly
weather as the heart of man could wish.  The meadows were full of
aromatic herbs, which, as we crushed them, sent up a delicate odour.
The little pools and shallows of the burns were as clear as a Lothian
trout-stream.  We were now going at a good pace, and I found that my
earlier weariness was growing less.  I was being keyed up for some
great crisis, for in my case the spirit acts direct on the body, and
fatigue grows and ebbs with hope.  I knew that my strength was not far
from breaking-point; but I knew also that so long as a chance was left
me I should have enough for a stroke.

Before I realized where we were we had rounded the hill, and were
looking down on the green cup of the upper Machudi's glen.  Far down, I
remember, where the trees began, there was a cloud of smoke.  Some
Kaffir--or maybe Arcoll--had fired the forest.  The smoke was drifting
away under a light west wind over the far plains, so that they were
seen through a haze of opal.

Laputa bade me take the lead.  I saw quite clear the red kloof on the
far side, where the collar was hid.  To get there we might have ridden
straight into the cup, but a providential instinct made me circle round
the top till we were on the lip of the ravine.  This was the road some
of Machudi's men had taken, and unthinkingly I followed them.  Twenty
minutes' riding brought us to the place, and all the while I had no
kind of plan of escape.  I was in the hands of my Maker, watching, like
the Jews of old, for a sign.

Laputa dismounted and looked down into the gorge.

'There is no road there,' I said.  'We must go down to the foot and
come up the stream-side.  It would be better to leave your horse here.'
He started down the cliff, which from above looks a sheer precipice.
Then he seemed to agree with me, took the rope from the _schimmel_'s
neck, and knee-haltered his beast.  And at that moment I had an
inspiration.

With my wrist-rope in his hand, he preceded me down the hill till we
got to the red screes at the foot of the kloof.  Then, under my
guidance, we turned up into the darkness of the gorge.  As we entered I
looked back, and saw figures coming over the edge of the green
cup--Laputa's men, I guessed. What I had to do must be done quickly.

We climbed up the burn, over the succession of little cataracts, till
we came to the flat space of shingle and the long pool where I had been
taken that morning.  The ashes of the fire which Machudi's men had made
were plain on the rock. After that I had to climb a waterfall to get to
the rocky pool where I had bestowed the rubies.

'You must take off this thong,' I said.  'I must climb to get the
collar.  Cover me with a pistol if you like.  I won't be out of sight.'

Laputa undid the thong and set me free.  From his belt he took a
pistol, cocked it, and held it over his left hand.  I had seen this way
of shooting adopted by indifferent shots, and it gave me a wild hope
that he might not be much of a marksman.

It did not take me long to find the pool, close against the blackened
stump of a tree-fern.  I thrust in my hand and gathered up the jewels
from the cool sand.  They came out glowing like living fires, and for a
moment I thrilled with a sense of reverence.  Surely these were no
common stones which held in them the very heart of hell.  Clutching
them tightly, I climbed down to Laputa.

At the sight of the great Snake he gave a cry of rapture. Tearing it
from me, he held it at arm's length, his face lit with a passionate
joy.  He kissed it, he raised it to the sky; nay, he was on his knees
before it.  Once more he was the savage transported in the presence of
his fetich.  He turned to me with burning eyes.

'Down on your knees,' he cried, 'and reverence the _Ndhlondhlo_. Down,
you impious dog, and seek pardon for your sacrilege.'

'I won't,' I said.  'I won't bow to any heathen idol.'

He pointed his pistol at me.

'In a second I shoot where your head is now.  Down, you fool, or
perish.'

'You promised me my life,' I said stubbornly, though Heaven knows why I
chose to act thus.

He dropped the pistol and flung himself on me.  I was helpless as a
baby in his hands.  He forced me to the ground and rolled my face in
the sand; then he pulled me to my feet and tossed me backward, till I
almost staggered into the pool. I saved myself, and staggered instead
into the shallow at the foot of it, close under the ledge of the
precipice.

That morning, when Machudi's men were cooking breakfast, I had figured
out a route up the cliff.  This route was now my hope of escape.
Laputa had dropped his pistol, and the collar had plunged him in an
ecstasy of worship.  Now, if ever, was my time.  I must get on the
shelf which ran sideways up the cliff, and then scramble for dear life.

I pretended to be dazed and terrified.

'You promised me my life,' I whimpered.

'Your life,' he cried.  'Yes, you shall have your life; and before long
you will pray for death.'

'But I saved the Collar,' I pleaded.  'Henriques would have stolen it.
I brought it safe here, and now you have got it.'

Meantime I was pulling myself up on the shelf, and loosening with one
hand a boulder which overhung the pool.

'You have been repaid,' he said savagely.  'You will not die.'

'But my life is no use without liberty,' I said, working at the boulder
till it lay loose in its niche.

He did not answer, being intent on examining the Collar to see if it
had suffered any harm.

'I hope it isn't scratched,' I said.  'Henriques trod on it when I hit
him.'

Laputa peered at the gems like a mother at a child who has had a fall.
I saw my chance and took it.  With a great heave I pulled the boulder
down into the pool.  It made a prodigious splash, sending a shower of
spray over Laputa and the Collar. In cover of it I raced up the shelf,
straining for the shelter of the juniper tree.

A shot rang out and struck the rock above me.  A second later I had
reached the tree and was scrambling up the crack beyond it.

Laputa did not fire again.  He may have distrusted his shooting, or
seen a better way of it.  He dashed through the stream and ran up the
shelf like a klipspringer after me.  I felt rather than saw what was
happening, and with my heart in my mouth I gathered my dregs of energy
for the last struggle.

You know the nightmare when you are pursued by some awful terror, and,
though sick with fear, your legs have a strange numbness, and you
cannot drag them in obedience to the will.  Such was my feeling in the
crack above the juniper tree.  In truth, I had passed the bounds of my
endurance.  Last night I had walked fifty miles, and all day I had
borne the torments of a dreadful suspense.  I had been bound and gagged
and beaten till the force was out of my limbs.  Also, and above all, I
had had little food, and I was dizzy with want of sleep. My feet seemed
leaden, my hands had no more grip than putty.  I do not know how I
escaped falling into the pool, for my head was singing and my heart
thumping in my throat.  I seemed to feel Laputa's great hand every
second clawing at my heels.

I had reason for my fears.  He had entered the crack long before I had
reached the top, and his progress was twice as fast as mine.  When I
emerged on the topmost shelf he was scarcely a yard behind me.  But an
overhang checked his bulky figure and gave me a few seconds' grace.  I
needed it all, for these last steps on the shelf were the totterings of
an old man.  Only a desperate resolution and an extreme terror made me
drag one foot after the other.  Blindly I staggered on to the top of
the ravine, and saw before me the _schimmel_ grazing in the light of the
westering sun.

I forced myself into a sort of drunken run, and crawled into the
saddle.  Behind me, as I turned, I could see Laputa's shoulders rising
over the edge.  I had no knife to cut the knee-halter, and the horse
could not stir.

Then the miracle happened.  When the rope had gagged me, my teeth must
have nearly severed it at one place, and this Laputa had not noticed
when he used it as a knee-halter.  The shock of my entering the saddle
made the _schimmel_ fling up his head violently, and the rope snapped.  I
could not find the stirrups, but I dug my heels into his sides, and he
leaped forward.

At the same moment Laputa began to shoot.  It was a foolish move, for
he might have caught me by running, since I had neither spurs nor whip,
and the horse was hampered by the loose end of rope at his knee.  In
any case, being an indifferent shot, he should have aimed at the
_schimmel_, not at me; but I suppose he wished to save his charger.  One
bullet sang past my head; a second did my business for me.  It passed
over my shoulder, as I lay low in the saddle, and grazed the beast's
right ear.  The pain maddened him, and, rope-end and all, he plunged
into a wild gallop.  Other shots came, but they fell far short.  I saw
dimly a native or two--the men who had followed us--rush to intercept
me, and I think a spear was flung.  But in a flash we were past them,
and their cries faded behind me. I found the bridle, reached for the
stirrups, and galloped straight for the sunset and for freedom.



CHAPTER XVIII

HOW A MAN MAY SOMETIMES PUT HIS TRUST IN A HORSE

I had long passed the limit of my strength.  Only constant fear and
wild alternations of hope had kept me going so long, and now that I was
safe I became light-headed in earnest.  The wonder is that I did not
fall off.  Happily the horse was good and the ground easy, for I was
powerless to do any guiding.  I simply sat on his back in a silly glow
of comfort, keeping a line for the dying sun, which I saw in a nick of
the Iron Crown Mountain.  A sort of childish happiness possessed me.
After three days of imminent peril, to be free was to be in fairyland.
To be swishing through the long bracken or plunging among the
breast-high flowers of the meadowlands in a world of essential lights
and fragrances, seemed scarcely part of mortal experience.  Remember
that I was little more than a lad, and that I had faced death so often
of late that my mind was all adrift.  To be able to hope once more,
nay, to be allowed to cease both from hope and fear, was like a deep
and happy opiate to my senses.  Spent and frail as I was, my soul swam
in blessed waters of ease.

The mood did not last long.  I came back to earth with a shock, as the
_schimmel_ stumbled at the crossing of a stream.  I saw that the darkness
was fast falling, and with the sight panic returned to me.  Behind me I
seemed to hear the sound of pursuit.  The noise was in my ears, but
when I turned it ceased, and I saw only the dusky shoulders of hills.

I tried to remember what Arcoll had told me about his headquarters, but
my memory was wiped clean.  I thought they were on or near the highway,
but I could not remember where the highway was.  Besides, he was close
to the enemy, and I wanted to get back into the towns, far away from
the battle-line. If I rode west I must come in time to villages, where
I could hide myself.  These were unworthy thoughts, but my excuse must
be my tattered nerves.  When a man comes out of great danger, he is apt
to be a little deaf to the call of duty.

Suddenly I became ashamed.  God had preserved me from deadly perils,
but not that I might cower in some shelter.  I had a mission as clear
as Laputa's.  For the first time I became conscious to what a little
thing I owed my salvation.  That matter of the broken halter was like
the finger of Divine Providence.  I had been saved for a purpose, and
unless I fulfilled that purpose I should again be lost.  I was always a
fatalist, and in that hour of strained body and soul I became something
of a mystic.  My panic ceased, my lethargy departed, and a more manly
resolution took their place.  I gripped the _schimmel_ by the head and
turned him due left.  Now I remembered where the highroad ran, and I
remembered something else.

For it was borne in on me that Laputa had fallen into my hands.
Without any subtle purpose I had played a master game.  He was cut off
from his people, without a horse, on the wrong side of the highroad
which Arcoll's men patrolled. Without him the rising would crumble.
There might be war, even desperate war, but we should fight against a
leaderless foe.  If he could only be shepherded to the north, his game
was over, and at our leisure we could mop up the scattered
concentrations.

I was now as eager to get back into danger as I had been to get into
safety.  Arcoll must be found and warned, and that at once, or Laputa
would slip over to Inanda's Kraal under cover of dark.  It was a matter
of minutes, and on these minutes depended the lives of thousands.  It
was also a matter of ebbing strength, for with my return to common
sense I saw very clearly how near my capital was spent.  If I could
reach the highroad, find Arcoll or Arcoll's men, and give them my news,
I would do my countrymen a service such as no man in Africa could
render.  But I felt my head swimming, I was swaying crazily in the
saddle, and my hands had scarcely the force of a child's.  I could only
lie limply on the horse's back, clutching at his mane with trembling
fingers.  I remember that my head was full of a text from the Psalms
about not putting one's trust in horses.  I prayed that this one horse
might be an exception, for he carried more than Caesar and his fortunes.

My mind is a blank about those last minutes.  In less than an hour
after my escape I struck the highway, but it was an hour which in the
retrospect unrolls itself into unquiet years.  I was dimly conscious of
scrambling through a ditch and coming to a ghostly white road.  The
_schimmel_ swung to the right, and the next I knew some one had taken my
bridle and was speaking to me.

At first I thought it was Laputa and screamed.  Then I must have
tottered in the saddle, for I felt an arm slip round my middle.  The
rider uncorked a bottle with his teeth and forced some brandy down my
throat.  I choked and coughed, and then looked up to see a white
policeman staring at me.  I knew the police by the green
shoulder-straps.

'Arcoll,' I managed to croak.  'For God's sake take me to Arcoll.'

The man whistled shrilly on his fingers, and a second rider came
cantering down the road.  As he came up I recognized his face, but
could not put a name to it. 'Losh, it's the lad Crawfurd,' I heard a
voice say.  'Crawfurd, man, d'ye no mind me at Lourenco Marques?
Aitken?'

The Scotch tongue worked a spell with me.  It cleared my wits and
opened the gates of my past life.  At last I knew I was among my own
folk.

'I must see Arcoll.  I have news for him--tremendous news. O man, take
me to Arcoll and ask me no questions.  Where is he?  Where is he?'

'As it happens, he's about two hundred yards off,' Aitken said.  'That
light ye see at the top of the brae is his camp.'

They helped me up the road, a man on each side of me, for I could never
have kept in the saddle without their support. My message to Arcoll
kept humming in my head as I tried to put it into words, for I had a
horrid fear that my wits would fail me and I should be dumb when the
time came.  Also I was in a fever of haste.  Every minute I wasted
increased Laputa's chance of getting back to the kraal.  He had men
with him every bit as skilful as Arcoll's trackers.  Unless Arcoll had
a big force and the best horses there was no hope.  Often in looking
back at this hour I have marvelled at the strangeness of my behaviour.
Here was I just set free from the certainty of a hideous death, and yet
I had lost all joy in my security.  I was more fevered at the thought
of Laputa's escape than I had been at the prospect of David Crawfurd's
end.

The next thing I knew I was being lifted off the _schimmel_ by what
seemed to me a thousand hands.  Then came a glow of light, a great
moon, in the centre of which I stood blinking.  I was forced to sit
down on a bed, while I was given a cup of hot tea, far more reviving
than any spirits.  I became conscious that some one was holding my
hands, and speaking very slowly and gently.

'Davie,' the voice said, 'you're back among friends, my lad. Tell me,
where have you been?'

'I want Arcoll,' I moaned.  'Where is Ratitswan?'  There were tears of
weakness running down my cheeks.

'Arcoll is here,' said the voice; 'he is holding your hands, Davie.
Quiet, lad, quiet.  Your troubles are all over now.'

I made a great effort, found the eyes to which the voice belonged, and
spoke to them.

'Listen.  I stole the collar of Prester John at Dupree's Drift. I was
caught in the Berg and taken to the kraal--I forget its name--but I had
hid the rubies.'

'Yes,' the voice said, 'you hid the rubies,--and then?'

'Inkulu wanted them back, so I made a deal with him.  I took him to
Machudi's and gave him the collar, and then he fired at me and I
climbed and climbed ...  I climbed on a horse,' I concluded childishly.

I heard the voice say 'Yes?' again inquiringly, but my mind ran off at
a tangent.

'Beyers took guns up into the Wolkberg,' I cried shrilly. 'Why the
devil don't you do the same?  You have the whole Kaffir army in a trap.'

I saw a smiling face before me.

'Good lad.  Colles told me you weren't wanting in intelligence. What if
we have done that very thing, Davie?'

But I was not listening.  I was trying to remember the thing I most
wanted to say, and that was not about Beyers and his guns.  Those were
nightmare minutes.  A speaker who has lost the thread of his discourse,
a soldier who with a bayonet at his throat has forgotten the
password--I felt like them, and worse. And to crown all I felt my
faintness coming back, and my head dropping with heaviness.  I was in a
torment of impotence.

Arcoll, still holding my hands, brought his face close to mine, so that
his clear eyes mastered and constrained me.

'Look at me, Davie,' I heard him say.  'You have something to tell me,
and it is very important.  It is about Laputa, isn't it? Think, man.
You took him to Machudi's and gave him the collar.  He has gone back
with it to Inanda's Kraal.  Very well, my guns will hold him there.'

I shook my head.  'You can't.  You may split the army, but you can't
hold Laputa.  He will be over the Olifants before you fire a shot.' 'We
will hunt him down before he crosses.  And if not, we will catch him at
the railway.'

'For God's sake, hurry then,' I cried.  'In an hour he will be over it
and back in the kraal.'

'But the river is a long way.'

'River?' I repeated hazily.  'What river?  The Letaba is not the place.
It is the road I mean.'

Arcoll's hands closed firmly on my wrists.

'You left Laputa at Machudi's and rode here without stopping. That
would take you an hour.  Had Laputa a horse?'

'Yes; but I took it,' I stammered.  'You can see it behind me.' Arcoll
dropped my hands and stood up straight.

'By God, we've got him!' he said, and he spoke to his companions.  A
man turned and ran out of the tent.

Then I remembered what I wanted to say.  I struggled from the bed and
put my hands on his shoulders.

'Laputa is our side of the highroad.  Cut him off from his men, and
drive him north--north--away up to the Rooirand. Never mind the
Wolkberg and the guns, for they can wait.  I tell you Laputa is the
Rising, and he has the collar.  Without him you can mop up the Kaffirs
at your leisure.  Line the high-road with every man you have, for he
must cross it or perish. Oh, hurry, man, hurry; never mind me.  We're
saved if we can chivy Laputa till morning.  Quick, or I'll have to go
myself.'

The tent emptied, and I lay back on the bed with a dim feeling that my
duty was done and I could rest.  Henceforth the affair was in stronger
hands than mine.  I was so weak that I could not lift my legs up to the
bed, but sprawled half on and half off.

Utter exhaustion defeats sleep.  I was in a fever, and my eyes would
not close.  I lay and drowsed while it seemed to me that the outside
world was full of men and horses.  I heard voices and the sound of
hoofs and the jingle of bridles, but above all I heard the solid tramp
of an army.  The whole earth seemed to be full of war.  Before my mind
was spread the ribbon of the great highway.  I saw it run white through
the meadows of the plateau, then in a dark corkscrew down the glen of
the Letaba, then white again through the vast moonlit bush of the
plains, till the shanties of Wesselsburg rose at the end of it.  It
seemed to me to be less a road than a rampart, built of shining marble,
the Great Wall of Africa.  I saw Laputa come out of the shadows and try
to climb it, and always there was the sound of a rifle-breech clicking,
a summons, and a flight.  I began to take a keen interest in the game.
Down in the bush were the dark figures of the hunted, and on the white
wall were my own people--horse, foot, and artillery, the squadrons of
our defence.  What a general Arcoll was, and how great a matter had
David Crawfurd kindled!

A man came in--I suppose a doctor.  He took off my leggings and boots,
cutting them from my bleeding feet, but I knew no pain.  He felt my
pulse and listened to my heart.  Then he washed my face and gave me a
bowl of hot milk.  There must have been a drug in the milk, for I had
scarcely drunk it before a tide of sleep seemed to flow over my brain.
The white rampart faded from my eyes and I slept.



CHAPTER XIX

ARCOLL'S SHEPHERDING

While I lay in a drugged slumber great things were happening. What I
have to tell is no experience of my own, but the story as I pieced it
together afterwards from talks with Arcoll and Aitken.  The history of
the Rising has been compiled.  As I write I see before me on the
shelves two neat blue volumes in which Mr Alexander Upton, sometime
correspondent of the _Times_, has told for the edification of posterity
the tale of the war between the Plains and the Plateau.  To him the
Kaffir hero is Umbooni, a half-witted ruffian, whom we afterwards
caught and hanged.  He mentions Laputa only in a footnote as a renegade
Christian who had something to do with fomenting discontent.  He
considers that the word 'Inkulu,' which he often heard, was a Zulu name
for God.  Mr Upton is a picturesque historian, but he knew nothing of
the most romantic incident of all.  This is the tale of the midnight
shepherding of the 'heir of John' by Arcoll and his irregulars.

At Bruderstroom, where I was lying unconscious, there were two hundred
men of the police; sixty-three Basuto scouts under a man called
Stephen, who was half native in blood and wholly native in habits; and
three commandoes of the farmers, each about forty strong.  The
commandoes were really companies of the North Transvaal Volunteers, but
the old name had been kept and something of the old loose organization.
There were also two four-gun batteries of volunteer artillery, but
these were out on the western skirts of the Wolkberg following Beyers's
historic precedent.  Several companies of regulars were on their way
from Pietersdorp, but they did not arrive till the next day.  When they
came they went to the Wolkberg to join the artillery.  Along the Berg
at strategic points were pickets of police with native trackers, and at
Blaauwildebeestefontein there was a strong force with two field guns,
for there was some fear of a second Kaffir army marching by that place
to Inanda's Kraal.  At Wesselsburg out on the plain there was a biggish
police patrol, and a system of small patrols along the road, with a
fair number of Basuto scouts.  But the road was picketed, not held; for
Arcoll's patrols were only a branch of his Intelligence Department.  It
was perfectly easy, as I had found myself, to slip across in a gap of
the pickets.

Laputa would be in a hurry, and therefore he would try to cross at the
nearest point.  Hence it was Arcoll's first business to hold the line
between the defile of the Letaba and the camp at Bruderstroom.  A
detachment of the police who were well mounted galloped at racing speed
for the defile, and behind them the rest lined out along the road.  The
farmers took a line at right angles to the road, so as to prevent an
escape on the western flank.  The Basutos were sent into the woods as a
sort of advanced post to bring tidings of any movement there. Finally a
body of police with native runners at their stirrups rode on to the
drift where the road crosses the Letaba.  The place is called Main
Drift, and you will find it on the map. The natives were first of all
to locate Laputa, and prevent him getting out on the south side of the
triangle of hill and wood between Machudi's, the road, and the Letaba.
If he failed there, he must try to ford the Letaba below the drift, and
cross the road between the drift and Wesselsburg.  Now Arcoll had not
men enough to watch the whole line, and therefore if Laputa were once
driven below the drift, he must shift his men farther down the road.
Consequently it was of the first importance to locate Laputa's
whereabouts, and for this purpose the native trackers were sent
forward.  There was just a chance of capturing him, but Arcoll knew too
well his amazing veld-craft and great strength of body to build much
hope on that.

We were none too soon.  The advance men of the police rode into one of
the Kaffirs from Inanda's Kraal, whom Laputa had sent forward to see if
the way was clear.  In two minutes more he would have been across and
out of our power, for we had no chance of overtaking him in the woody
ravines of the Letaba.  The Kaffir, when he saw us, dived back into the
grass on the north side of the road, which made it clear that Laputa
was still there.

After that nothing happened for a little.  The police reached their
drift, and all the road west of that point was strongly held.  The
flanking commandoes joined hands with one of the police posts farther
north, and moved slowly to the scarp of the Berg.  They saw nobody;
from which Arcoll could deduce that his man had gone down the Berg into
the forests.

Had the Basutos been any good at woodcraft we should have had better
intelligence.  But living in a bare mountain country they are apt to
find themselves puzzled in a forest.  The best men among the trackers
were some renegades of 'Mpefu, who sent back word by a device known
only to Arcoll that five Kaffirs were in the woods a mile north of Main
Drift.  By this time it was after ten o'clock, and the moon was rising.
The five men separated soon after, and the reports became confused.
Then Laputa, as the biggest of the five, was located on the banks of
the Great Letaba about two miles below Main Drift.

The question was as to his crossing.  Arcoll had assumed that he would
swim the river and try to get over the road between Main Drift and
Wesselsburg.  But in this assumption he underrated the shrewdness of
his opponent.  Laputa knew perfectly well that we had not enough men to
patrol the whole countryside, but that the river enabled us to divide
the land into two sections and concentrate strongly on one or the
other. Accordingly he left the Great Letaba unforded and resolved to
make a long circuit back to the Berg.  One of his Kaffirs swam the
river, and when word of this was brought Arcoll began to withdraw his
posts farther down the road.  But as the men were changing 'Mpefu's
fellows got wind of Laputa's turn to the left, and in great haste
Arcoll countermanded the move and waited in deep perplexity at Main
Drift.

The salvation of his scheme was the farmers on the scarp of the Berg.
They lit fires and gave Laputa the notion of a great army.  Instead of
going up the glen of Machudi or the Letsitela he bore away to the north
for the valley of the Klein Letaba. The pace at which he moved must
have been amazing.  He had a great physique, hard as nails from long
travelling, and in his own eyes he had an empire at stake.  When I look
at the map and see the journey which with vast fatigue I completed from
Dupree's Drift to Machudi's, and then look at the huge spaces of
country over which Laputa's legs took him on that night, I am lost in
admiration of the man.

About midnight he must have crossed the Letsitela.  Here he made a
grave blunder.  If he had tried the Berg by one of the faces he might
have got on to the plateau and been at Inanda's Kraal by the dawning.
But he over-estimated the size of the commandoes, and held on to the
north, where he thought there would be no defence.  About one o'clock
Arcoll, tired of inaction and conscious that he had misread Laputa's
tactics, resolved on a bold stroke.  He sent half his police to the
Berg to reinforce the commandoes, bidding them get into touch with the
post at Blaauwildebeestefontein.

A little after two o'clock a diversion occurred.  Henriques succeeded
in crossing the road three miles east of Main Drift. He had probably
left the kraal early in the night and had tried to cross farther west,
but had been deterred by the patrols. East of Main Drift, where the
police were fewer, he succeeded; but he had not gone far till he was
discovered by the Basuto scouts.  The find was reported to Arcoll, who
guessed at once who this traveller was.  He dared not send out any of
his white men, but he bade a party of the scouts follow the
Portugoose's trail.  They shadowed him to Dupree's Drift, where he
crossed the Letaba.  There he lay down by the roadside to sleep, while
they kept him company.  A hard fellow Henriques was, for he could
slumber peacefully on the very scene of his murder.

Dawn found Laputa at the head of the Klein Letaba glen, not far from
'Mpefu's kraal.  He got food at a hut, and set off at once up the
wooded hill above it, which is a promontory of the plateau.  By this
time he must have been weary, or he would not have blundered as he did
right into a post of the farmers.  He was within an ace of capture, and
to save himself was forced back from the scarp.  He seems, to judge
from reports, to have gone a little way south in the thicker timber,
and then to have turned north again in the direction of
Blaauwildebeestefontein.  After that his movements are obscure.  He was
seen on the Klein Labongo, but the sight of the post at
Blaauwildebeestefontein must have convinced him that a _korhaan_ could
not escape that way.  The next we heard of him was that he had joined
Henriques. After daybreak Arcoll, having got his reports from the
plateau, and knowing roughly the direction in which Laputa was shaping,
decided to advance his lines.  The farmers, reinforced by three more
commandoes from the Pietersdorp district, still held the plateau, but
the police were now on the line of the Great Letaba.  It was Arcoll's
plan to hold that river and the long neck of land between it and the
Labongo.  His force was hourly increasing, and his mounted men would be
able to prevent any escape on the flank to the east of Wesselsburg.

So it happened that while Laputa was being driven east from the Berg,
Henriques was travelling north, and their lines intersected.  I should
like to have seen the meeting.  It must have told Laputa what had
always been in the Portugoose's heart.  Henriques, I fancy, was making
for the cave in the Rooirand.  Laputa, so far as I can guess at his
mind, had a plan for getting over the Portuguese border, fetching a
wide circuit, and joining his men at any of the concentrations between
there and Amsterdam.

The two were seen at midday going down the road which leads from
Blaauwildebeestefontein to the Lebombo.  Then they struck Arcoll's new
front, which stretched from the Letaba to the Labongo.  This drove them
north again, and forced them to swim the latter stream.  From there to
the eastern extremity of the Rooirand, which is the Portuguese
frontier, the country is open and rolling, with a thin light scrub in
the hollows.  It was bad cover for the fugitives, as they found to
their cost.  For Arcoll had purposely turned his police into a flying
column.  They no longer held a line; they scoured a country.  Only
Laputa's incomparable veld-craft and great bodily strength prevented
the two from being caught in half an hour.  They doubled back, swam the
Labongo again, and got into the thick bush on the north side of the
Blaauwildebeestefontein road.  The Basuto scouts were magnificent in
the open, but in the cover they were again at fault.  Laputa and
Henriques fairly baffled them, so that the pursuit turned to the west
in the belief that the fugitives had made for Majinje's kraal.  In
reality they had recrossed the Labongo and were making for Umvelos'.


All this I heard afterwards, but in the meantime I lay in Arcoll's tent
in deep unconsciousness.  While my enemies were being chased like
partridges, I was reaping the fruits of four days' toil and terror.
The hunters had become the hunted, the wheel had come full circle, and
the woes of David Crawfurd were being abundantly avenged.

I slept till midday of the next day.  When I awoke the hot noontide sun
had made the tent like an oven.  I felt better, but very stiff and
sore, and I had a most ungovernable thirst. There was a pail of water
with a tin pannikin beside the tent pole, and out of this I drank
repeated draughts.  Then I lay down again, for I was still very weary.

But my second sleep was not like my first.  It was haunted by wild
nightmares.  No sooner had I closed my eyes than I began to live and
move in a fantastic world.  The whole bush of the plains lay before me,
and I watched it as if from some view-point in the clouds.  It was
midday, and the sandy patches shimmered under a haze of heat.  I saw
odd little movements in the bush--a buck's head raised, a paauw
stalking solemnly in the long grass, a big crocodile rolling off a
mudbank in the river.  And then I saw quite clearly Laputa's figure
going east.

In my sleep I did not think about Arcoll's manoeuvres.  My mind was
wholly set upon Laputa.  He was walking wearily, yet at a good pace,
and his head was always turning, like a wild creature snuffing the
wind.  There was something with him, a shapeless shadow, which I could
not see clearly.  His neck was bare, but I knew well that the collar
was in his pouch.

He stopped, turned west, and I lost him.  The bush world for a space
was quite silent, and I watched it eagerly as an aeronaut would watch
the ground for a descent.  For a long time I could see nothing.  Then
in a wood near a river there seemed to be a rustling.  Some guinea-fowl
flew up as if startled, and a stembok scurried out.  I knew that Laputa
must be there.

Then, as I looked at the river, I saw a head swimming.  Nay, I saw two,
one some distance behind the other.  The first man landed on the far
bank, and I recognized Laputa.  The second was a slight short figure,
and I knew it was Henriques.

I remember feeling very glad that these two had come together.  It was
certain now that Henriques would not escape. Either Laputa would find
out the truth and kill him, or I would come up with him and have my
revenge.  In any case he was outside the Kaffir pale, adventuring on
his own.

I watched the two till they halted near a ruined building. Surely this
was the store I had built at Umvelos'.  The thought gave me a horrid
surprise.  Laputa and Henriques were on their way to the Rooirand!


I woke with a start to find my forehead damp with sweat. There was some
fever on me, I think, for my teeth were chattering.  Very clear in my
mind was the disquieting thought that Laputa and Henriques would soon
be in the cave.

One of two things must happen--either Henriques would kill Laputa, get
the collar of rubies, and be in the wilds of Mozambique before I could
come up with his trail; or Laputa would outwit him, and have the
handling himself of the treasure of gold and diamonds which had been
laid up for the rising.  If he thought there was a risk of defeat, I
knew he would send my gems to the bottom of the Labongo, and all my
weary work would go for nothing.  I had forgotten all about patriotism.
In that hour the fate of the country was nothing to me, and I got no
satisfaction from the thought that Laputa was severed from his army.
My one idea was that the treasure would be lost, the treasure for which
I had risked my life.

There is a kind of courage which springs from bitter anger and
disappointment.  I had thought that I had bankrupted my spirit, but I
found that there was a new passion in me to which my past sufferings
taught no lesson.  My uneasiness would not let me rest a moment longer.
I rose to my feet, holding on by the bed, and staggered to the tent
pole.  I was weak, but not so very weak that I could not make one last
effort.  It maddened me that I should have done so much and yet fail at
the end.

From a nail on the tent pole hung a fragment of looking-glass which
Arcoll used for shaving.  I caught a glimpse of my face in it, white
and haggard and lined, with blue bags below the eyes.  The doctor the
night before had sponged it, but he had not got rid of all the stains
of travel.  In particular there was a faint splash of blood on the left
temple.  I remembered that this was what I had got from the basin of
goat's blood that night in the cave. I think that the sight of that
splash determined me.  Whether I willed it or not, I was sealed of
Laputa's men.  I must play the game to the finish, or never again know
peace of mind on earth.  These last four days had made me very old.


I found a pair of Arcoll's boots, roomy with much wearing, into which I
thrust my bruised feet.  Then I crawled to the door, and shouted for a
boy to bring my horse.  A Basuto appeared, and, awed by my appearance,
went off in a hurry to see to the _schimmel_.  It was late afternoon,
about the same time of day as had yesterday seen me escaping from
Machudi's.  The Bruderstroom camp was empty, though sentinels were
posted at the approaches.  I beckoned the only white man I saw, and
asked where Arcoll was.  He told me that he had no news, but added that
the patrols were still on the road as far as Wesselsburg. From this I
gathered that Arcoll must have gone far out into the bush in his chase.
I did not want to see him; above all, I did not want him to find
Laputa.  It was my private business that I rode on, and I asked for no
allies.

Somebody brought me a cup of thick coffee, which I could not drink, and
helped me into the saddle.  The _schimmel_ was fresh, and kicked freely
as I cantered off the grass into the dust of the highroad.  The whole
world, I remember, was still and golden in the sunset.



CHAPTER XX

MY LAST SIGHT OF THE REVEREND JOHN LAPUTA

It was dark before I got into the gorge of the Letaba.  I passed many
patrols, but few spoke to me, and none tried to stop me. Some may have
known me, but I think it was my face and figure which tied their
tongues.  I must have been pale as death, with tangled hair and fever
burning in my eyes.  Also on my left temple was the splash of blood.

At Main Drift I found a big body of police holding the ford. I splashed
through and stumbled into one of their camp-fires. A man questioned me,
and told me that Arcoll had got his quarry.  'He's dead, they say.
They shot him out on the hills when he was making for the Limpopo.'
But I knew that this was not true.  It was burned on my mind that
Laputa was alive, nay, was waiting for me, and that it was God's will
that we should meet in the cave.

A little later I struck the track of the Kaffirs' march.  There was a
broad, trampled way through the bush, and I followed it, for it led to
Dupree's Drift.  All this time I was urging the _schimmel_ with all the
vigour I had left in me.  I had quite lost any remnant of fear.  There
were no terrors left for me either from Nature or man.  At Dupree's
Drift I rode the ford without a thought of crocodiles.  I looked
placidly at the spot where Henriques had slain the Keeper and I had
stolen the rubies. There was no interest or imagination lingering in my
dull brain.  My nerves had suddenly become things of stolid, untempered
iron.  Each landmark I passed was noted down as one step nearer to my
object.  At Umvelos' I had not the leisure to do more than glance at
the shell which I had built.  I think I had forgotten all about that
night when I lay in the cellar and heard Laputa's plans.  Indeed, my
doings of the past days were all hazy and trivial in my mind.  I only
saw one sight clearly--two men, one tall and black, the other little
and sallow, slowly creeping nearer to the Rooirand, and myself, a
midget on a horse, spurring far behind through the bush on their trail.
I saw the picture as continuously and clearly as if I had been looking
at a scene on the stage.  There was only one change in the setting; the
three figures seemed to be gradually closing together.

I had no exhilaration in my quest.  I do not think I had even much
hope, for something had gone numb and cold in me and killed my youth.
I told myself that treasure-hunting was an enterprise accursed of God,
and that I should most likely die. That Laputa and Henriques would die
I was fully certain. The three of us would leave our bones to bleach
among the diamonds, and in a little the Prester's collar would glow
amid a little heap of human dust.  I was quite convinced of all this,
and quite apathetic.  It really did not matter so long as I came up
with Laputa and Henriques, and settled scores with them.  That mattered
everything in the world, for it was my destiny.

I had no means of knowing how long I took, but it was after midnight
before I passed Umvelos', and ere I got to the Rooirand there was a
fluttering of dawn in the east.  I must have passed east of Arcoll's
men, who were driving the bush towards Majinje's.  I had ridden the
night down and did not feel so very tired.  My horse was stumbling, but
my own limbs scarcely pained me.  To be sure I was stiff and nerveless
as if hewn out of wood, but I had been as bad when I left Bruderstroom.
I felt as if I could go on riding to the end of the world.

At the brink of the bush I dismounted and turned the _schimmel_ loose.  I
had brought no halter, and I left him to graze and roll.  The light was
sufficient to let me see the great rock face rising in a tower of dim
purple.  The sky was still picked out with stars, but the moon had long
gone down, and the east was flushing.  I marched up the path to the
cave, very different from the timid being who had walked the same road
three nights before.  Then my terrors were all to come: now I had
conquered terror and seen the other side of fear.  I was centuries
older.

But beside the path lay something which made me pause.  It was a dead
body, and the head was turned away from me.  I did not need to see the
face to know who it was.  There had been only two men in my vision, and
one of them was immortal.

I stopped and turned the body over.  There was no joy in my heart, none
of the lust of satisfied vengeance or slaked hate. I had forgotten
about the killing of my dog and all the rest of Henriques' doings.  It
was only with curiosity that I looked down on the dead face, swollen
and livid in the first light of morning.

The man had been strangled.  His neck, as we say in Scotland, was
'thrawn', and that was why he had lain on his back yet with his face
turned away from me.  He had been dead probably since before midnight.
I looked closer, and saw that there was blood on his shirt and hands,
but no wound.  It was not his blood, but some other's.  Then a few feet
off on the path I found a pistol with two chambers empty.

What had happened was very plain.  Henriques had tried to shoot Laputa
at the entrance of the cave for the sake of the collar and the treasure
within.  He had wounded him--gravely, I thought, to judge from the
amount of blood--but the quickness and marksmanship of the Portuguese
had not availed to save his life from those terrible hands.  After two
shots Laputa had got hold of him and choked his life out as easily as a
man twists a partridge's neck.  Then he had gone into the cave.

I saw the marks of blood on the road, and hastened on. Laputa had been
hours in the cave, enough to work havoc with the treasure.  He was
wounded, too, and desperate.  Probably he had come to the Rooirand
looking for sanctuary and rest for a day or two, but if Henriques had
shot straight he might find a safer sanctuary and a longer rest.  For
the third time in my life I pushed up the gully between the straight
high walls of rock, and heard from the heart of the hills the thunder
of the imprisoned river.

There was only the faintest gleam of light in the cleft, but it
sufficed to show me that the way to the cave was open.  The hidden
turnstile in the right wall stood ajar; I entered, and carelessly swung
it behind me.  The gates clashed into place with a finality which told
me that they were firmly shut.  I did not know the secret of them, so
how should I get out again?

These things troubled me less than the fact that I had no light at all
now.  I had to go on my knees to ascend the stair, and I could feel
that the steps were wet.  It must be Laputa's blood.

Next I was out on the gallery which skirted the chasm.  The sky above
me was growing pale with dawn, and far below the tossing waters were
fretted with light.  A light fragrant wind was blowing on the hills,
and a breath of it came down the funnel.  I saw that my hands were all
bloody with the stains on the steps, and I rubbed them on the rock to
clean them. Without a tremor I crossed the stone slab over the gorge,
and plunged into the dark alley which led to the inner chamber.

As before, there was a light in front of me, but this time it was a
pin-point and not the glare of many torches.  I felt my way carefully
by the walls of the passage, though I did not really fear anything.  It
was by the stopping of these lateral walls that I knew I was in the
cave, for the place had only one single speck of light.  The falling
wall of water stood out grey green and ghostly on the left, and I
noticed that higher up it was lit as if from the open air.  There must
be a great funnel in the hillside in that direction.  I walked a few
paces, and then I made out that the spark in front was a lantern.

My eyes were getting used to the half-light, and I saw what was beside
the lantern.  Laputa knelt on the ashes of the fire which the Keeper
had kindled three days before.  He knelt before, and half leaned on, a
rude altar of stone.  The lantern stood by him on the floor, and its
faint circle lit something which I was not unprepared for.  Blood was
welling from his side, and spreading in a dark pool over the ashes.

I had no fear, only a great pity--pity for lost romance, for vain
endeavour, for fruitless courage.  'Greeting, Inkulu!' I said in
Kaffir, as if I had been one of his indunas.

He turned his head and slowly and painfully rose to his feet. The
place, it was clear, was lit from without, and the daylight was
growing.  The wall of the river had become a sheet of jewels, passing
from pellucid diamond above to translucent emerald below.  A dusky
twilight sought out the extreme corners of the cave.  Laputa's tall
figure stood swaying above the white ashes, his hand pressed to his
side.

'Who is it?' he said, looking at me with blind eyes.

'It is the storekeeper from Umvelos',' I answered.

'The storekeeper of Umvelos',' he repeated.  'God has used the weak
things of the world to confound the strong.  A king dies because a
pedlar is troublesome.  What do they call you, man?  You deserve to be
remembered.'

I told him 'David Crawfurd.'

'Crawfurd,' he repeated, 'you have been the little reef on which a
great vessel has foundered.  You stole the collar and cut me off from
my people, and then when I was weary the Portuguese killed me.'

'No,' I cried, 'it was not me.  You trusted Henriques, and you got your
fingers on his neck too late.  Don't say I didn't warn you.'

'You warned me, and I will repay you.  I will make you rich, Crawfurd.
You are a trader, and want money.  I am a king, and want a throne.  But
I am dying, and there will be no more kings in Africa.'

The mention of riches did not thrill me as I had expected, but the last
words awakened a wild regret.  I was hypnotized by the man.  To see him
going out was like seeing the fall of a great mountain.

He stretched himself, gasping, and in the growing light I could see how
broken he was.  His cheeks were falling in, and his sombre eyes had
shrunk back in their sockets.  He seemed an old worn man standing there
among the ashes, while the blood, which he made no effort to staunch,
trickled down his side till it dripped on the floor.  He had ceased to
be the Kaffir king, or the Christian minister, or indeed any one of his
former parts.  Death was stripping him to his elements, and the man
Laputa stood out beyond and above the characters he had played,
something strange, and great, and moving, and terrible.

'We met for the first time three days ago,' he said, 'and now you will
be the last to see the Inkulu.'

'Umvelos' was not our first meeting,' said I.  'Do you mind the Sabbath
eight years since when you preached in the Free Kirk at Kirkcaple?  I
was the boy you chased from the shore, and I flung the stone that
blacked your eye.  Besides, I came out from England with you and
Henriques, and I was in the boat which took you from Durban to Delagoa
Bay.  You and I have been long acquaint, Mr Laputa.'

'It is the hand of God,' he said solemnly.  'Your fate has been twisted
with mine, and now you will die with me.'

I did not understand this talk about dying.  I was not mortally wounded
like him, and I did not think Laputa had the strength to kill me even
if he wished.  But my mind was so impassive that I scarcely regarded
his words.

'I will make you rich,' he cried.  'Crawfurd, the storekeeper, will be
the richest man in Africa.  We are scattered, and our wealth is
another's.  He shall have the gold and the diamonds--all but the
Collar, which goes with me.'

He staggered into a dark recess, one of many in the cave, and I
followed him.  There were boxes there, tea chests, cartridge cases, and
old brass-ribbed Portuguese coffers. Laputa had keys at his belt, and
unlocked them, his fingers fumbling with weakness.  I peered in and saw
gold coin and little bags of stones.

'Money and diamonds,' he cried.  'Once it was the war chest of a king,
and now it will be the hoard of a trader.  No, by the Lord!  The
trader's place is with the Terrible Ones.'  An arm shot out, and my
shoulder was fiercely gripped.

'You stole my horse.  That is why I am dying.  But for you I and my
army would be over the Olifants.  I am going to kill you, Crawfurd,'
and his fingers closed in to my shoulder blades.

Still I was unperturbed.  'No, you are not.  You cannot.  You have
tried to and failed.  So did Henriques, and he is lying dead outside.
I am in God's keeping, and cannot die before my time.'

I do not know if he heard me, but at any rate the murderous fit passed.
His hand fell to his side and his great figure tottered out into the
cave.  He seemed to be making for the river, but he turned and went
through the door I had entered by.  I heard him slipping in the
passage, and then there was a minute of silence.

Suddenly there came a grinding sound, followed by the kind of muffled
splash which a stone makes when it falls into a deep well.  I thought
Laputa had fallen into the chasm, but when I reached the door his
swaying figure was coming out of the corridor.  Then I knew what he had
done.  He had used the remnant of his giant strength to break down the
bridge of stone across the gorge, and so cut off my retreat.

I really did not care.  Even if I had got over the bridge I should
probably have been foiled by the shut turnstile.  I had quite forgotten
the meaning of fear of death.

I found myself giving my arm to the man who had tried to destroy me.

'I have laid up for you treasure in heaven,' he said.  'Your earthly
treasure is in the boxes, but soon you will be seeking incorruptible
jewels in the deep deep water.  It is cool and quiet down there, and
you forget the hunger and pain.'

The man was getting very near his end.  The madness of despair came
back to him, and he flung himself among the ashes.

'We are going to die together, Crawfurd,' he said.  'God has twined our
threads, and there will be only one cutting.  Tell me what has become
of my army.'

'Arcoll has guns on the Wolkberg,' I said.  'They must submit or
perish.'

'I have other armies ...  No, no, they are nothing.  They will all
wander and blunder and fight and be beaten.  There is no leader
anywhere ...  And I am dying.'

There was no gainsaying the signs of death.  I asked him if he would
like water, but he made no answer.  His eyes were fixed on vacancy, and
I thought I could realize something of the bitterness of that great
regret.  For myself I was as cold as a stone.  I had no exultation of
triumph, still less any fear of my own fate.  I stood silent, the
half-remorseful spectator of a fall like the fall of Lucifer.

'I would have taught the world wisdom.'  Laputa was speaking English in
a strange, thin, abstracted voice.  'There would have been no king like
me since Charlemagne,' and he strayed into Latin which I have been told
since was an adaptation of the Epitaph of Charles the Great.  '_Sub hoc
conditorio_,' he crooned, '_situm est corpus Joannis, magni et orthodoxi
Imperatoris, qui imperium Africanum nobiliter ampliavit, et multos per
annos mundum feliciter rexit_.'[1]  He must have chosen this epitaph
long ago.

He lay for a few seconds with his head on his arms, his breast heaving
with agony.

'No one will come after me.  My race is doomed, and in a little they
will have forgotten my name.  I alone could have saved them.  Now they
go the way of the rest, and the warriors of John become drudges and
slaves.'

Something clicked in his throat, he gasped and fell forward, and I
thought he was dead.  Then he struggled as if to rise.  I ran to him,
and with all my strength aided him to his feet.

'Unarm, Eros,' he cried.  'The long day's task is done.'  With the
strange power of a dying man he tore off his leopard-skin and belt till
he stood stark as on the night when he had been crowned.  From his
pouch he took the Prester's Collar.  Then he staggered to the brink of
the chasm where the wall of green water dropped into the dark depth
below.

I watched, fascinated, as with the weak hands of a child he twined the
rubies round his neck and joined the clasp.  Then with a last effort he
stood straight up on the brink, his eyes raised to the belt of daylight
from which the water fell.  The light caught the great gems and called
fires from them, the flames of the funeral pyre of a king.

Once more his voice, restored for a moment to its old vigour, rang out
through the cave above the din of the cascade.  His words were those
which the Keeper had used three nights before.  With his hands held
high and the Collar burning on his neck he cried, 'The Snake returns to
the House of its Birth.'

'Come,' he cried to me.  'The Heir of John is going home.' Then he
leapt into the gulf.  There was no sound of falling, so great was the
rush of water.  He must have been whirled into the open below where the
bridge used to be, and then swept into the underground deeps, where the
Labongo drowses for thirty miles.  Far from human quest he sleeps his
last sleep, and perhaps on a fragment of bone washed into a crevice of
rock there may hang the jewels that once gleamed in Sheba's hair.

Emperor, who nobly enlarged the African realm, and for many years
happily ruled the world.'



CHAPTER XXI

I CLIMB THE CRAGS A SECOND TIME

I remember that I looked over the brink into the yeasty abyss with a
mind hovering between perplexity and tears.  I wanted to sit down and
cry--why, I did not know, except that some great thing had happened.
My brain was quite clear as to my own position.  I was shut in this
place, with no chance of escape and with no food.  In a little I must
die of starvation, or go mad and throw myself after Laputa.  And yet I
did not care a rush.  My nerves had been tried too greatly in the past
week. Now I was comatose, and beyond hoping or fearing.

I sat for a long time watching the light play on the fretted sheet of
water and wondering where Laputa's body had gone. I shivered and wished
he had not left me alone, for the darkness would come in time and I had
no matches.  After a little I got tired of doing nothing, and went
groping among the treasure chests.  One or two were full of
coin--British sovereigns, Kruger sovereigns, Napoleons, Spanish and
Portuguese gold pieces, and many older coins ranging back to the Middle
Ages and even to the ancients.  In one handful there was a splendid
gold stater, and in another a piece of Antoninus Pius.  The treasure
had been collected for many years in many places, contributions of
chiefs from ancient hoards as well as the cash received from I.D.B.  I
untied one or two of the little bags of stones and poured the contents
into my hands.  Most of the diamonds were small, such as a labourer
might secrete on his person.  The larger ones--and some were very
large--were as a rule discoloured, looking more like big cairngorms.
But one or two bags had big stones which even my inexperienced eye told
me were of the purest water.  There must be some new pipe, I thought,
for these could not have been stolen from any known mine.

* * *

After that I sat on the floor again and looked at the water.  It
exercised a mesmeric influence on me, soothing all care.  I was quite
happy to wait for death, for death had no meaning to me.  My hate and
fury were both lulled into a trance, since the passive is the next
stage to the overwrought.

It must have been full day outside now, for the funnel was bright with
sunshine, and even the dim cave caught a reflected radiance.  As I
watched the river I saw a bird flash downward, skimming the water.  It
turned into the cave and fluttered among its dark recesses.  I heard
its wings beating the roof as it sought wildly for an outlet.  It
dashed into the spray of the cataract and escaped again into the cave.
For maybe twenty minutes it fluttered, till at last it found the way it
had entered by.  With a dart it sped up the funnel of rock into light
and freedom.

I had begun to watch the bird in idle lassitude, I ended in keen
excitement.  The sight of it seemed to take a film from my eyes.  I
realized the zest of liberty, the passion of life again.  I felt that
beyond this dim underworld there was the great joyous earth, and I
longed for it.  I wanted to live now.  My memory cleared, and I
remembered all that had befallen me during the last few days.  I had
played the chief part in the whole business, and I had won.  Laputa was
dead and the treasure was mine, while Arcoll was crushing the Rising at
his ease.  I had only to be free again to be famous and rich.  My hopes
had returned, but with them came my fears.  What if I could not escape?
I must perish miserably by degrees, shut in the heart of a hill, though
my friends were out for rescue.  In place of my former lethargy I was
now in a fever of unrest.

My first care was to explore the way I had come.  I ran down the
passage to the chasm which the slab of stone had spanned. I had been
right in my guess, for the thing was gone.  Laputa was in truth a
Titan, who in the article of death could break down a bridge which
would have taken any three men an hour to shift.  The gorge was about
seven yards wide, too far to risk a jump, and the cliff fell sheer and
smooth to the imprisoned waters two hundred feet below.  There was no
chance of circuiting it, for the wall was as smooth as if it had been
chiselled.  The hand of man had been at work to make the sanctuary
inviolable.

It occurred to me that sooner or later Arcoll would track Laputa to
this place.  He would find the bloodstains in the gully, but the
turnstile would be shut and he would never find the trick of it.  Nor
could he have any kaffirs with him who knew the secret of the Place of
the Snake.  Still if Arcoll knew I was inside he would find some way to
get to me even though he had to dynamite the curtain of rock.  I
shouted, but my voice seemed to be drowned in the roar of the water.
It made but a fresh chord in the wild orchestra, and I gave up hopes in
that direction.

Very dolefully I returned to the cave.  I was about to share the
experience of all treasure-hunters--to be left with jewels galore and
not a bite to sustain life.  The thing was too commonplace to be
endured.  I grew angry, and declined so obvious a fate.  'Ek sal 'n
plan maak,' I told myself in the old Dutchman's words.  I had come
through worse dangers, and a way I should find.  To starve in the cave
was no ending for David Crawfurd.  Far better to join Laputa in the
depths in a manly hazard for liberty.

My obstinacy and irritation cheered me.  What had become of the
lack-lustre young fool who had mooned here a few minutes back.  Now I
was as tense and strung for effort as the day I had ridden from
Blaauwildebeestefontein to Umvelos'.  I felt like a runner in the last
lap of a race.  For four days I had lived in the midst of terror and
darkness.  Daylight was only a few steps ahead, daylight and youth
restored and a new world.

There were only two outlets from that cave--the way I had come, and the
way the river came.  The first was closed, the second a sheer staring
impossibility.  I had been into every niche and cranny, and there was
no sign of a passage.  I sat down on the floor and looked at the wall
of water.  It fell, as I have already explained, in a solid sheet,
which made up the whole of the wall of the cave.  Higher than the roof
of the cave I could not see what happened, except that it must be the
open air, for the sun was shining on it.  The water was about three
yards distant from the edge of the cave's floor, but it seemed to me
that high up, level with the roof, this distance decreased to little
more than a foot.

I could not see what the walls of the cave were like, but they looked
smooth and difficult.  Supposing I managed to climb up to the level of
the roof close to the water, how on earth was I to get outside on to
the wall of the ravine?  I knew from my old days of rock-climbing what
a complete obstacle the overhang of a cave is.

While I looked, however, I saw a thing which I had not noticed before.
On the left side of the fall the water sluiced down in a sheet to the
extreme edge of the cave, almost sprinkling the floor with water.  But
on the right side the force of water was obviously weaker, and a little
short of the level of the cave roof there was a spike of rock which
slightly broke the fall.  The spike was covered, but the covering was
shallow, for the current flowed from it in a rose-shaped spray.  If a
man could get to that spike and could get a foot on it without being
swept down, it might be possible--just possible--to do something with
the wall of the chasm above the cave.  Of course I knew nothing about
the nature of that wall.  It might be as smooth as a polished pillar.

The result of these cogitations was that I decided to prospect the
right wall of the cave close to the waterfall.  But first I went
rummaging in the back part to see if I could find anything to assist
me.  In one corner there was a rude cupboard with some stone and metal
vessels.  Here, too, were the few domestic utensils of the dead Keeper.
In another were several locked coffers on which I could make no
impression.  There were the treasure-chests too, but they held nothing
save treasure, and gold and diamonds were no manner of use to me.
Other odds and ends I found--spears, a few skins, and a broken and
notched axe.  I took the axe in case there might be cutting to do.

Then at the back of a bin my hand struck something which brought the
blood to my face.  It was a rope, an old one, but still in fair
condition and forty or fifty feet long.  I dragged it out into the
light and straightened its kinks.  With this something could be done,
assuming I could cut my way to the level of the roof.

I began the climb in my bare feet, and at the beginning it was very
bad.  Except on the very edge of the abyss there was scarcely a
handhold.  Possibly in floods the waters may have swept the wall in a
curve, smoothing down the inner part and leaving the outer to its
natural roughness.  There was one place where I had to hang on by a
very narrow crack while I scraped with the axe a hollow for my right
foot.  And then about twelve feet from the ground I struck the first of
the iron pegs.

To this day I cannot think what these pegs were for.  They were old
square-headed things which had seen the wear of centuries.  They cannot
have been meant to assist a climber, for the dwellers of the cave had
clearly never contemplated this means of egress.  Perhaps they had been
used for some kind of ceremonial curtain in a dim past.  They were
rusty and frail, and one of them came away in my hand, but for all that
they marvellously assisted my ascent.

I had been climbing slowly, doggedly and carefully, my mind wholly
occupied with the task; and almost before I knew I found my head close
under the roof of the cave.  It was necessary now to move towards the
river, and the task seemed impossible.  I could see no footholds, save
two frail pegs, and in the corner between the wall and the roof was a
rough arch too wide for my body to jam itself in.  Just below the level
of the roof--say two feet--I saw the submerged spike of rock. The
waters raged around it, and could not have been more than an inch deep
on the top.  If I could only get my foot on that I believed I could
avoid being swept down, and stand up and reach for the wall above the
cave.

But how to get to it?  It was no good delaying, for my frail holds
might give at any moment.  In any case I would have the moral security
of the rope, so I passed it through a fairly staunch pin close to the
roof, which had an upward tilt that almost made a ring of it.  One end
of the rope was round my body, the other was loose in my hand, and I
paid it out as I moved.  Moral support is something.  Very gingerly I
crawled like a fly along the wall, my fingers now clutching at a tiny
knob, now clawing at a crack which did little more than hold my nails.
It was all hopeless insanity, and yet somehow I did it.  The rope and
the nearness of the roof gave me confidence and balance. Then the holds
ceased altogether a couple of yards from the water.  I saw my spike of
rock a trifle below me.  There was nothing for it but to risk all on a
jump.  I drew the rope out of the hitch, twined the slack round my
waist, and leaped for the spike.

It was like throwing oneself on a line of spears.  The solid wall of
water hurled me back and down, but as I fell my arms closed on the
spike.  There I hung while my feet were towed outwards by the volume of
the stream as if they had been dead leaves.  I was half-stunned by the
shock of the drip on my head, but I kept my wits, and presently got my
face outside the falling sheet and breathed.

To get to my feet and stand on the spike while all the fury of water
was plucking at me was the hardest physical effort I have ever made.
It had to be done very circumspectly, for a slip would send me into the
abyss.  If I moved an arm or leg an inch too near the terrible dropping
wall I knew I should be plucked from my hold.  I got my knees on the
outer face of the spike, so that all my body was removed as far as
possible from the impact of the water.  Then I began to pull myself
slowly up.

I could not do it.  If I got my feet on the rock the effort would bring
me too far into the water, and that meant destruction.  I saw this
clearly in a second while my wrists were cracking with the strain.  But
if I had a wall behind me I could reach back with one hand and get what
we call in Scotland a 'stelf.'  I knew there was a wall, but how far I
could not judge. The perpetual hammering of the stream had confused my
wits.

It was a horrible moment, but I had to risk it.  I knew that if the
wall was too far back I should fall, for I had to let my weight go till
my hand fell on it.  Delay would do no good, so with a prayer I flung
my right hand back, while my left hand clutched the spike.

I found the wall--it was only a foot or two beyond my reach.  With a
heave I had my foot on the spike, and turning, had both hands on the
opposite wall.  There I stood, straddling like a Colossus over a waste
of white waters, with the cave floor far below me in the gloom, and my
discarded axe lying close to a splash of Laputa's blood.

The spectacle made me giddy, and I had to move on or fall. The wall was
not quite perpendicular, but as far as I could see a slope of about
sixty degrees.  It was ribbed and terraced pretty fully, but I could
see no ledge within reach which offered standing room.  Once more I
tried the moral support of the rope, and as well as I could dropped a
noose on the spike which might hold me if I fell.  Then I boldly
embarked on a hand traverse, pulling myself along a little ledge till I
was right in the angle of the fall.  Here, happily, the water was
shallower and less violent, and with my legs up to the knees in foam I
managed to scramble into a kind of corner.  Now at last I was on the
wall of the gully, and above the cave.  I had achieved by amazing luck
one of the most difficult of all mountaineering operations.  I had got
out of a cave to the wall above.

My troubles were by no means over, for I found the cliff most difficult
to climb.  The great rush of the stream dizzied my brain, the spray
made the rock damp, and the slope steepened as I advanced.  At one
overhang my shoulder was almost in the water again.  All this time I
was climbing doggedly, with terror somewhere in my soul, and hope
lighting but a feeble lamp.  I was very distrustful of my body, for I
knew that at any moment my weakness might return.  The fever of three
days of peril and stress is not allayed by one night's rest.

By this time I was high enough to see that the river came out of the
ground about fifty feet short of the lip of the gully, and some ten
feet beyond where I stood.  Above the hole whence the waters issued was
a loose slope of slabs and screes. It looked an ugly place, but there I
must go, for the rock-wall I was on was getting unclimbable.

I turned the corner a foot or two above the water, and stood on a slope
of about fifty degrees, running from the parapet of stone to a line
beyond which blue sky appeared.  The first step I took the place began
to move.  A boulder crashed into the fall, and tore down into the abyss
with a shattering thunder.  I lay flat and clutched desperately at
every hold, but I had loosened an avalanche of earth, and not till my
feet were sprayed by the water did I get a grip of firm rock and check
my descent.  All this frightened me horribly, with the kind of
despairing angry fear which I had suffered at Bruderstroom, when I
dreamed that the treasure was lost.  I could not bear the notion of
death when I had won so far.

After that I advanced, not by steps, but by inches.  I felt more poised
and pinnacled in the void than when I had stood on the spike of rock,
for I had a substantial hold neither for foot nor hand.  It seemed
weeks before I made any progress away from the lip of the waterhole.  I
dared not look down, but kept my eyes on the slope before me, searching
for any patch of ground which promised stability.  Once I found a scrog
of juniper with firm roots, and this gave me a great lift.  A little
further, however, I lit on a bank of screes which slipped with me to
the right, and I lost most of the ground the bush had gained me.  My
whole being, I remember, was filled with a devouring passion to be quit
of this gully and all that was in it.

Then, not suddenly as in romances, but after hard striving and hope
long deferred, I found myself on a firm outcrop of weathered stone.  In
three strides I was on the edge of the plateau.  Then I began to run,
and at the same time to lose the power of running.  I cast one look
behind me, and saw a deep cleft of darkness out of which I had climbed.
Down in the cave it had seemed light enough, but in the clear sunshine
of the top the gorge looked a very pit of shade.  For the first and
last time in my life I had vertigo.  Fear of falling back, and a mad
craze to do it, made me acutely sick.  I managed to stumble a few steps
forward on the mountain turf, and then flung myself on my face.

When I raised my head I was amazed to find it still early morning.  The
dew was yet on the grass, and the sun was not far up the sky.  I had
thought that my entry into the cave, my time in it, and my escape had
taken many hours, whereas at the most they had occupied two.  It was
little more than dawn, such a dawn as walks only on the hilltops.
Before me was the shallow vale with its bracken and sweet grass, and
farther on the shining links of the stream, and the loch still grey in
the shadow of the beleaguering hills.  Here was a fresh, clean land, a
land for homesteads and orchards and children.  All of a sudden I
realized that at last I had come out of savagery. The burden of the
past days slipped from my shoulders.  I felt young again, and cheerful
and brave.  Behind me was the black night, and the horrid secrets of
darkness.  Before me was my own country, for that loch and that bracken
might have been on a Scotch moor.  The fresh scent of the air and the
whole morning mystery put song into my blood.  I remembered that I was
not yet twenty. My first care was to kneel there among the bracken and
give thanks to my Maker, who in very truth had shown me 'His goodness
in the land of the living.'

After a little I went back to the edge of the cliff.  There where the
road came out of the bush was the body of Henriques, lying sprawled on
the sand, with two dismounted riders looking hard at it.  I gave a
great shout, for in the men I recognized Aitken and the schoolmaster
Wardlaw.



CHAPTER XXII

A GREAT PERIL AND A GREAT SALVATION

I must now take up some of the ragged ends which I have left behind me.
It is not my task, as I have said, to write the history of the great
Rising.  That has been done by abler men, who were at the centre of the
business, and had some knowledge of strategy and tactics; whereas I was
only a raw lad who was privileged by fate to see the start.  If I
could, I would fain make an epic of it, and show how the Plains found
at all points the Plateau guarded, how wits overcame numbers, and at
every pass which the natives tried the great guns spoke and the tide
rolled back.  Yet I fear it would be an epic without a hero. There was
no leader left when Laputa had gone.  There were months of guerrilla
fighting, and then months of reprisals, when chief after chief was
hunted down and brought to trial. Then the amnesty came and a clean
sheet, and white Africa drew breath again with certain grave
reflections left in her head.  On the whole I am not sorry that the
history is no business of mine.  Romance died with 'the heir of John,'
and the crusade became a sorry mutiny.  I can fancy how differently
Laputa would have managed it all had he lived; how swift and sudden his
plans would have been; how under him the fighting would not have been
in the mountain glens, but far in the high-veld among the dorps and
townships.  With the Inkulu alive we warred against odds; with the
Inkulu dead the balance sank heavily in our favour.  I leave to others
the marches and strategy of the thing, and hasten to clear up the
obscure parts in my own fortunes.

Arcoll received my message from Umvelos' by Colin, or rather Wardlaw
received it and sent it on to the post on the Berg where the leader had
gone.  Close on its heels came the message from Henriques by a Shangaan
in his pay.  It must have been sent off before the Portugoose got to
the Rooirand, from which it would appear that he had his own men in the
bush near the store, and that I was lucky to get off as I did. Arcoll
might have disregarded Henriques' news as a trap if it had come alone,
but my corroboration impressed and perplexed him.  He began to credit
the Portugoose with treachery, but he had no inclination to act on his
message, since it conflicted with his plans.  He knew that Laputa must
come into the Berg sooner or later, and he had resolved that his
strategy must be to await him there.  But there was the question of my
life.  He had every reason to believe that I was in the greatest
danger, and he felt a certain responsibility for my fate.  With the few
men at his disposal he could not hope to hold up the great Kaffir army,
but there was a chance that he might by a bold stand effect my rescue.
Henriques had told him of the vow, and had told him that Laputa would
ride in the centre of the force.  A body of men well posted at Dupree's
Drift might split the army at the crossing, and under cover of the fire
I might swim the river and join my friends.  Still relying on the vow,
it might be possible for well-mounted men to evade capture.
Accordingly he called for volunteers, and sent off one of his Kaffirs
to warn me of his design.  He led his men in person, and of his doings
the reader already knows the tale. But though the crossing was flung
into confusion, and the rear of the army was compelled to follow the
northerly bank of the Letaba, there was no sign of me anywhere.  Arcoll
searched the river-banks, and crossed the drift to where the old Keeper
was lying dead.  He then concluded that I had been murdered early in
the march, and his Kaffir, who might have given him news of me, was
carried up the stream in the tide of the disorderly army.  Therefore,
he and his men rode back with all haste to the Berg by way of Main
Drift, and reached Bruderstroom before Laputa had crossed the highway.

My information about Inanda's Kraal decided Arcoll's next move.  Like
me he remembered Beyers's performance, and resolved to repeat it.  He
had no hope of catching Laputa, but he thought that he might hold up
the bulk of his force if he got guns on the ridge above the kraal.  A
message had already been sent for guns, and the first to arrive got to
Bruderstroom about the hour when I was being taken by Machudi's men in
the kloof.  The ceremony of the purification prevented Laputa from
keeping a good look-out, and the result was that a way was made for the
guns on the north-western corner of the rampart of rock.  It was the
way which Beyers had taken, and indeed the enterprise was directed by
one of Beyers's old commandants.  All that day the work continued,
while Laputa and I were travelling to Machudi's.  Then came the evening
when I staggered into camp and told my news.  Arcoll, who alone knew
how vital Laputa was to the success of the insurrection, immediately
decided to suspend all other operations and devote himself to
shepherding the leader away from his army.  How the scheme succeeded
and what befell Laputa the reader has already been told.

Aitken and Wardlaw, when I descended from the cliffs, took me straight
to Blaauwildebeestefontein.  I was like a man who is recovering from
bad fever, cured, but weak and foolish, and it was a slow journey which
I made to Umvelos', riding on Aitken's pony.  At Umvelos' we found a
picket who had captured the _schimmel_ by the roadside.  That wise beast,
when I turned him loose at the entrance to the cave, had trotted
quietly back the way he had come.  At Umvelos' Aitken left me, and next
day, with Wardlaw as companion, I rode up the glen of the Klein
Labongo, and came in the afternoon to my old home.  The store was
empty, for Japp some days before had gone off post-haste to
Pietersdorp; but there was Zeeta cleaning up the place as if war had
never been heard of.  I slept the night there, and in the morning found
myself so much recovered that I was eager to get away.  I wanted to see
Arcoll about many things, but mainly about the treasure in the cave.

It was an easy journey to Bruderstroom through the meadows of the
plateau.  The farmers' commandoes had been recalled, but the ashes of
their camp fires were still grey among the bracken.  I fell in with a
police patrol and was taken by them to a spot on the Upper Letaba, some
miles west of the camp, where we found Arcoll at late breakfast.  I had
resolved to take him into my confidence, so I told him the full tale of
my night's adventure.  He was very severe with me, I remember, for my
daft-like ride, but his severity relaxed before I had done with my
story.

The telling brought back the scene to me, and I shivered at the picture
of the cave with the morning breaking through the veil of water and
Laputa in his death throes.  Arcoll did not speak for some time.

'So he is dead,' he said at last, half-whispering to himself. 'Well, he
was a king, and died like a king.  Our job now is simple, for there is
none of his breed left in Africa.'

Then I told him of the treasure.

'It belongs to you, Davie,' he said, 'and we must see that you get it.
This is going to be a long war, but if we survive to the end you will
be a rich man.'

'But in the meantime?' I asked.  'Supposing other Kaffirs hear of it,
and come back and make a bridge over the gorge? They may be doing it
now.'

'I'll put a guard on it,' he said, jumping up briskly.  'It's maybe not
a soldier's job, but you've saved this country, Davie, and I'm going to
make sure that you have your reward.'


After that I went with Arcoll to Inanda's Kraal.  I am not going to
tell the story of that performance, for it occupies no less than two
chapters in Mr Upton's book.  He makes one or two blunders, for he
spells my name with an 'o,' and he says we walked out of the camp on
our perilous mission 'with faces white and set as a Crusader's.'  That
is certainly not true, for in the first place nobody saw us go who
could judge how we looked, and in the second place we were both smoking
and feeling quite cheerful.  At home they made a great fuss about it,
and started a newspaper cry about the Victoria Cross, but the danger
was not so terrible after all, and in any case it was nothing to what I
had been through in the past week.

I take credit to myself for suggesting the idea.  By this time we had
the army in the kraal at our mercy.  Laputa not having returned, they
had no plans.  It had been the original intention to start for the
Olifants on the following day, so there was a scanty supply of food.
Besides, there were the makings of a pretty quarrel between Umbooni and
some of the north-country chiefs, and I verily believe that if we had
held them tight there for a week they would have destroyed each other
in faction fights.  In any case, in a little they would have grown
desperate and tried to rush the approaches on the north and south.
Then we must either have used the guns on them, which would have meant
a great slaughter, or let them go to do mischief elsewhere.  Arcoll was
a merciful man who had no love for butchery; besides, he was a
statesman with an eye to the future of the country after the war.  But
it was his duty to isolate Laputa's army, and at all costs, it must be
prevented from joining any of the concentrations in the south.

Then I proposed to him to do as Rhodes did in the Matoppos, and go and
talk to them.  By this time, I argued, the influence of Laputa must
have sunk, and the fervour of the purification be half-forgotten.  The
army had little food and no leader.  The rank and file had never been
fanatical, and the chiefs and indunas must now be inclined to sober
reflections. But once blood was shed the lust of blood would possess
them. Our only chance was to strike when their minds were perplexed and
undecided.

Arcoll did all the arranging.  He had a message sent to the chiefs
inviting them to an indaba, and presently word was brought back that an
indaba was called for the next day at noon.  That same night we heard
that Umbooni and about twenty of his men had managed to evade our ring
of scouts and got clear away to the south.  This was all to our
advantage, as it removed from the coming indaba the most irreconcilable
of the chiefs.

That indaba was a queer business.  Arcoll and I left our escort at the
foot of a ravine, and entered the kraal by the same road as I had left
it.  It was a very bright, hot winter's day, and try as I might, I
could not bring myself to think of any danger. I believed that in this
way most temerarious deeds are done; the doer has become insensible to
danger, and his imagination is clouded with some engrossing purpose.
The first sentries received us gloomily enough, and closed behind us as
they had done when Machudi's men haled me thither.  Then the job became
eerie, for we had to walk across a green flat with thousands of eyes
watching us.  By-and-by we came to the merula tree opposite the kyas,
and there we found a ring of chiefs, sitting with cocked rifles on
their knees.

We were armed with pistols, and the first thing Arcoll did was to hand
them to one of the chiefs. 'We come in peace,' he said.  'We give you
our lives.'


Then the indaba began, Arcoll leading off.  It was a fine speech he
made, one of the finest I have ever listened to.  He asked them what
their grievances were; he told them how mighty was the power of the
white man; he promised that what was unjust should be remedied, if only
they would speak honestly and peacefully; he harped on their old
legends and songs, claiming for the king of England the right of their
old monarchs.  It was a fine speech, and yet I saw that it did not
convince them.  They listened moodily, if attentively, and at the end
there was a blank silence.

Arcoll turned to me.  'For God's sake, Davie,' he said, 'talk to them
about Laputa.  It's our only chance.'

I had never tried speaking before, and though I talked their tongue I
had not Arcoll's gift of it.  But I felt that a great cause was at
stake, and I spoke up as best I could.

I began by saying that Inkulu had been my friend, and that at Umvelos'
before the rising he had tried to save my life.  At the mention of the
name I saw eyes brighten.  At last the audience was hanging on my
words. I told them of Henriques and his treachery.  I told them frankly
and fairly of the doings at Dupree's Drift.  I made no secret of the
part I played.  'I was fighting for my life,' I said. 'Any man of you
who is a man would have done the like.'

Then I told them of my last ride, and the sight I saw at the foot of
the Rooirand.  I drew a picture of Henriques lying dead with a broken
neck, and the Inkulu, wounded to death, creeping into the cave.

In moments of extremity I suppose every man becomes an orator.  In that
hour and place I discovered gifts I had never dreamed of.  Arcoll told
me afterwards that I had spoken like a man inspired, and by a fortunate
chance had hit upon the only way to move my hearers.  I told of that
last scene in the cave, when Laputa had broken down the bridge, and had
spoken his dying words--that he was the last king in Africa, and that
without him the rising was at an end.  Then I told of his leap into the
river, and a great sigh went up from the ranks about Me.

'You see me here,' I said, 'by the grace of God.  I found a way up the
fall and the cliffs which no man has ever travelled before or will
travel again.  Your king is dead.  He was a great king, as I who stand
here bear witness, and you will never more see his like.  His last
words were that the Rising was over. Respect that word, my brothers.
We come to you not in war but in peace, to offer a free pardon, and the
redress of your wrongs.  If you fight you fight with the certainty of
failure, and against the wish of the heir of John.  I have come here at
the risk of my life to tell you his commands.  His spirit approves my
mission.  Think well before you defy the mandate of the Snake, and risk
the vengeance of the Terrible Ones.'

After that I knew that we had won.  The chiefs talked among themselves
in low whispers, casting strange looks at me.  Then the greatest of
them advanced and laid his rifle at my feet.

'We believe the word of a brave man,' he said.  'We accept the mandate
of the Snake.'

Arcoll now took command.  He arranged for the disarmament bit by bit,
companies of men being marched off from Inanda's Kraal to stations on
the plateau where their arms were collected by our troops, and food
provided for them.  For the full history I refer the reader to Mr
Upton's work.  It took many days, and taxed all our resources, but by
the end of a week we had the whole of Laputa's army in separate
stations, under guard, disarmed, and awaiting repatriation.

Then Arcoll went south to the war which was to rage around the
Swaziland and Zululand borders for many months, while to Aitken and
myself was entrusted the work of settlement.  We had inadequate troops
at our command, and but for our prestige and the weight of Laputa's
dead hand there might any moment have been a tragedy.  The task took
months, for many of the levies came from the far north, and the job of
feeding troops on a long journey was difficult enough in the winter
season when the energies of the country were occupied with the fighting
in the south.  Yet it was an experience for which I shall ever be
grateful, for it turned me from a rash boy into a serious man.  I knew
then the meaning of the white man's duty.  He has to take all risks,
recking nothing of his life or his fortunes, and well content to find
his reward in the fulfilment of his task.  That is the difference
between white and black, the gift of responsibility, the power of being
in a little way a king; and so long as we know this and practise it, we
will rule not in Africa alone but wherever there are dark men who live
only for the day and their own bellies.  Moreover, the work made me
pitiful and kindly.  I learned much of the untold grievances of the
natives, and saw something of their strange, twisted reasoning.  Before
we had got Laputa's army back to their kraals, with food enough to tide
them over the spring sowing, Aitken and I had got sounder policy in our
heads than you will find in the towns, where men sit in offices and see
the world through a mist of papers.

By this time peace was at hand, and I went back to Inanda's Kraal to
look for Colin's grave.  It was not a difficult quest, for on the sward
in front of the merula tree they had buried him. I found a mason in the
Iron Kranz village, and from the excellent red stone of the
neighbourhood was hewn a square slab with an inscription.  It ran thus:
'Here lies buried the dog Colin, who was killed in defending D.
Crawfurd, his master. To him it was mainly due that the Kaffir Rising
failed.'  I leave those who have read my tale to see the justice of the
words.



CHAPTER XXIII

MY UNCLE'S GIFT IS MANY TIMES MULTIPLIED

We got at the treasure by blowing open the turnstile.  It was easy
enough to trace the spot in the rock where it stood, but the most
patient search did not reveal its secret.  Accordingly we had recourse
to dynamite, and soon laid bare the stone steps, and ascended to the
gallery.  The chasm was bridged with planks, and Arcoll and I crossed
alone.  The cave was as I had left it.  The bloodstains on the floor
had grown dark with time, but the ashes of the sacramental fire were
still there to remind me of the drama I had borne a part in.  When I
looked at the way I had escaped my brain grew dizzy at the thought of
it.  I do not think that all the gold on earth would have driven me a
second time to that awful escalade.  As for Arcoll, he could not see
its possibility at all.

'Only a madman could have done it,' he said, blinking his eyes at the
green linn.  'Indeed, Davie, I think for about four days you were as
mad as they make.  It was a fortunate thing, for your madness saved the
country.'

With some labour we got the treasure down to the path, and took it
under a strong guard to Pietersdorp.  The Government were busy with the
settling up after the war, and it took many weeks to have our business
disposed of.  At first things looked badly for me.  The
Attorney-General set up a claim to the whole as spoils of war, since,
he argued, it was the war-chest of the enemy we had conquered.  I do
not know how the matter would have gone on legal grounds, though I was
advised by my lawyers that the claim was a bad one.  But the part I had
played in the whole business, more especially in the visit to Inanda's
Kraal, had made me a kind of popular hero, and the Government thought
better of their first attitude.  Besides, Arcoll had great influence,
and the whole story of my doings, which was told privately by him to
some of the members of the Government, disposed them to be generous.
Accordingly they agreed to treat the contents of the cave as ordinary
treasure trove, of which, by the law, one half went to the discoverer
and one half to the Crown.

This was well enough so far as the gold was concerned, but another
difficulty arose about the diamonds; for a large part of these had
obviously been stolen by labourers from the mines, and the mining
people laid claim to them as stolen goods.  I was advised not to
dispute this claim, and consequently we had a great sorting-out of the
stones in the presence of the experts of the different mines.  In the
end it turned out that identification was not an easy matter, for the
experts quarrelled furiously among themselves.  A compromise was at
last come to, and a division made; and then the diamond companies
behaved very handsomely, voting me a substantial sum in recognition of
my services in recovering their property.  What with this and with my
half share of the gold and my share of the unclaimed stones, I found
that I had a very considerable fortune.  The whole of my stones I sold
to De Beers, for if I had placed them on the open market I should have
upset the delicate equipoise of diamond values.  When I came finally to
cast up my accounts, I found that I had secured a fortune of a trifle
over a quarter of a million pounds.

The wealth did not dazzle so much as it solemnized me.  I had no
impulse to spend any part of it in a riot of folly.  It had come to me
like fairy gold out of the void; it had been bought with men's blood,
almost with my own.  I wanted to get away to a quiet place and think,
for of late my life had been too crowded with drama, and there comes a
satiety of action as well as of idleness.  Above all things I wanted to
get home. They gave me a great send-off, and sang songs, and good
fellows shook my hand till it ached.  The papers were full of me, and
there was a banquet and speeches.  But I could not relish this glory as
I ought, for I was like a boy thrown violently out of his bearings. Not
till I was in the train nearing Cape Town did I recover my equanimity.
The burden of the past seemed to slip from me suddenly as on the
morning when I had climbed the linn. I saw my life all lying before me;
and already I had won success.  I thought of my return to my own
country, my first sight of the grey shores of Fife, my visit to
Kirkcaple, my meeting with my mother.  I was a rich man now who could
choose his career, and my mother need never again want for comfort.  My
money seemed pleasant to me, for if men won theirs by brains or
industry, I had won mine by sterner methods, for I had staked against
it my life.  I sat alone in the railway carriage and cried with pure
thankfulness.  These were comforting tears, for they brought me back to
my old common-place self.

My last memory of Africa is my meeting with Tam Dyke.  I caught sight
of him in the streets of Cape Town, and running after him, clapped him
on the shoulder.  He stared at me as if he had seen a ghost.

'Is it yourself, Davie?' he cried.  'I never looked to see you again in
this world.  I do nothing but read about you in the papers.  What for
did ye not send for me?  Here have I been knocking about inside a ship
and you have been getting famous.  They tell me you're a millionaire,
too.'

I had Tam to dinner at my hotel, and later, sitting smoking on the
terrace and watching the flying-ants among the aloes, I told him the
better part of the story I have here written down.

'Man, Davie,' he said at the end, 'you've had a tremendous time.  Here
are you not eighteen months away from home, and you're going back with
a fortune.  What will you do with it?' I told him that I proposed, to
begin with, to finish my education at Edinburgh College.  At this he
roared with laughter.

'That's a dull ending, anyway.  It's me that should have the money, for
I'm full of imagination.  You were aye a prosaic body, Davie.'

'Maybe I am,' I said; 'but I am very sure of one thing.  If I hadn't
been a prosaic body, I wouldn't be sitting here to-night.'

* * *

Two years later Aitken found the diamond pipe, which he had always
believed lay in the mountains.  Some of the stones in the cave, being
unlike any ordinary African diamonds, confirmed his suspicions and set
him on the track.  A Kaffir tribe to the north-east of the Rooirand had
known of it, but they had never worked it, but only collected the
overspill.  The closing down of one of the chief existing mines had
created a shortage of diamonds in the world's markets, and once again
the position was the same as when Kimberley began.  Accordingly he made
a great fortune, and to-day the Aitken Proprietary Mine is one of the
most famous in the country.  But Aitken did more than mine diamonds,
for he had not forgotten the lesson we had learned together in the work
of resettlement.  He laid down a big fund for the education and
amelioration of the native races, and the first fruit of it was the
establishment at Blaauwildebeestefontein itself of a great native
training college.  It was no factory for making missionaries and black
teachers, but an institution for giving the Kaffirs the kind of
training which fits them to be good citizens of the state.  There you
will find every kind of technical workshop, and the finest experimental
farms, where the blacks are taught modern agriculture.  They have
proved themselves apt pupils, and to-day you will see in the glens of
the Berg and in the plains Kaffir tillage which is as scientific as any
in Africa.  They have created a huge export trade in tobacco and fruit;
the cotton promises well; and there is talk of a new fibre which will
do wonders.  Also along the river bottoms the india-rubber business is
prospering.

There are playing-fields and baths and reading-rooms and libraries just
as in a school at home.  In front of the great hall of the college a
statue stands, the figure of a black man shading his eyes with his
hands and looking far over the plains to the Rooirand.  On the pedestal
it is lettered 'Prester John,' but the face is the face of Laputa.  So
the last of the kings of Africa does not lack his monument.

Of this institution Mr Wardlaw is the head.  He writes to me weekly,
for I am one of the governors, as well as an old friend, and from a
recent letter I take this passage:--

'I often cast my mind back to the afternoon when you and I sat on the
stoep of the schoolhouse, and talked of the Kaffirs and our future.  I
had about a dozen pupils then, and now I have nearly three thousand;
and in place of a tin-roofed shanty and a yard, I have a whole
countryside.  You laughed at me for my keenness, Davie, but I've seen
it justified.  I was never a man of war like you, and so I had to bide
at home while you and your like were straightening out the troubles.
But when it was all over my job began, for I could do what you couldn't
do--I was the physician to heal wounds.  You mind how nervous I was
when I heard the drums beat.  I hear them every evening now, for we
have made a rule that all the Kaffir farms on the Berg sound a kind of
curfew.  It reminds me of old times, and tells me that though it is
peace nowadays we mean to keep all the manhood in them that they used
to exercise in war.  It would do your eyes good to see the garden we
have made out of the Klein Labongo glen.  The place is one big orchard
with every kind of tropical fruit in it, and the irrigation dam is as
full of fish as it will hold.  Out at Umvelos' there is a
tobacco-factory, and all round Sikitola's we have square miles of
mealie and cotton fields.  The loch on the Rooirand is stocked with
Lochleven trout, and we have made a bridle-path up to it in a gully
east of the one you climbed.  You ask about Machudi's.  The last time I
was there the place was white with sheep, for we have got the edge of
the plateau grazed down, and sheep can get the short bite there.  We
have cleaned up all the kraals, and the chiefs are members of our
county council, and are as fond of hearing their own voices as an
Aberdeen bailie.  It's a queer transformation we have wrought, and when
I sit and smoke my pipe in the evening, and look over the plains and
then at the big black statue you and Aitken set up, I thank the
Providence that has guided me so far.  I hope and trust that, in the
Bible words, "the wilderness and the solitary place are glad for us."
At any rate it will not be my fault if they don't "blossom as the
rose".  Come out and visit us soon, man, and see the work you had a
hand in starting....'

I am thinking seriously of taking Wardlaw's advice.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
