 well i  did  pay you back some of it wunst  
 yes you did   bout six chaws 
you borry d store tobacker and paid back nigger head  
store tobacco is flat black plug but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted 
when they borrow a chaw they don t generly cut it off with a knife but set the plug in between their teeth and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it s handed back and says sarcastic  here gimme the  chaw  and you take the  plug  
all the streets and lanes was just mud they warn t nothing else  but  mud  mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places and two or three inches deep in  all  the places 
the hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres 
you d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way where folks had to walk around her and she d stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her and look as happy as if she was on salary 
and pretty soon you d hear a loafer sing out hi 
so  boy 
sick him tige  
and away the sow would go squealing most horrible with a dog or two swinging to each ear and three or four dozen more a coming and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise 
then they d settle back again till there was a dog fight 
there couldn t anything wake them up all over and make them happy all over like a dog fight  unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death 
on the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank and they was bowed and bent and about ready to tumble in 
the people had moved out of them 
the bank was caved away under one corner of some others and that corner was hanging over 
people lived in them yet but it was dangersome because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time 
sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer 
such a town as that has to be always moving back and back and back because the river s always gnawing at it 
the nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets and more coming all the time 
families fetched their dinners with them from the country and eat them in the wagons 
there was considerable whisky drinking going on and i seen three fights 
by and by somebody sings out  here comes old boggs   in from the country for his little old monthly drunk here he comes boys  
all the loafers looked glad i reckoned they was used to having fun out of boggs 
one of them says  wonder who he s a gwyne to chaw up this time 
if he d a chawed up all the men he s ben a gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he d have considerable ruputation now  
another one says i wisht old boggs d threaten me cuz then i d know i warn t gwyne to die for a thousan year  
boggs comes a tearing along on his horse whooping and yelling like an injun and singing out  cler the track thar 
i m on the waw path and the price uv coffins is a gwyne to raise  
he was drunk and weaving about in his saddle he was over fifty year old and had a very red face 
everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him and he sassed back and said he d attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns but he couldn t wait now because he d come to town to kill old colonel sherburn and his motto was meat first and spoon vittles to top off on  
he see me and rode up and says  whar d you come f m boy 
you prepared to die  
then he rode on 
i was scared but a man says  he don t mean nothing he s always a carryin on like that when he s drunk 
he s the best naturedest old fool in arkansaw  never hurt nobody drunk nor sober  
boggs rode up before the biggest store in town and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells  come out here sherburn 
come out and meet the man you ve swindled 
you re the houn i m after and i m a gwyne to have you too  
and so he went on calling sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on 
by and by a proud looking man about fifty five  and he was a heap the best dressed man in that town too  steps out of the store and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come 
he says to boggs mighty ca m and slow  he says  i m tired of this but i ll endure it till one o clock 
till one o clock mind  no longer 
if you open your mouth against me only once after that time you can t travel so far but i will find you  
then he turns and goes in 
the crowd looked mighty sober nobody stirred and there warn t no more laughing 
boggs rode off blackguarding sherburn as loud as he could yell all down the street and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store still keeping it up 
some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up but he wouldn t they told him it would be one o clock in about fifteen minutes and so he  must  go home  he must go right away 
but it didn t do no good 
he cussed away with all his might and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it and pretty soon away he went a raging down the street again with his gray hair a flying 
everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober but it warn t no use  up the street he would tear again and give sherburn another cussing 
by and by somebody says  go for his daughter   quick go for his daughter sometimes he ll listen to her 
if anybody can persuade him she can  
so somebody started on a run 
i walked down street a ways and stopped 
in about five or ten minutes here comes boggs again but not on his horse 
he was a reeling across the street towards me bare headed with a friend on both sides of him a holt of his arms and hurrying him along 
he was quiet and looked uneasy and he warn t hanging back any but was doing some of the hurrying himself 
somebody sings out  boggs  
i looked over there to see who said it and it was that colonel sherburn 
he was standing perfectly still in the street and had a pistol raised in his right hand  not aiming it but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky 
the same second i see a young girl coming on the run and two men with her 
boggs and the men turned round to see who called him and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side and the pistol barrel come down slow and steady to a level  both barrels cocked 
boggs throws up both of his hands and says o lord don t shoot  
bang 
goes the first shot and he staggers back clawing at the air  bang 
goes the second one and he tumbles backwards on to the ground heavy and solid with his arms spread out 
that young girl screamed out and comes rushing and down she throws herself on her father crying and saying oh he s killed him he s killed him  
the crowd closed up around them and shouldered and jammed one another with their necks stretched trying to see and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting back back 
give him air give him air  
colonel sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground and turned around on his heels and walked off 
they took boggs to a little drug store the crowd pressing around just the same and the whole town following and i rushed and got a good place at the window where i was close to him and could see in 
they laid him on the floor and put one large bible under his head and opened another one and spread it on his breast but they tore open his shirt first and i seen where one of the bullets went in 
he made about a dozen long gasps his breast lifting the bible up when he drawed in his breath and letting it down again when he breathed it out  and after that he laid still he was dead 
then they pulled his daughter away from him screaming and crying and took her off 
she was about sixteen and very sweet and gentle looking but awful pale and scared 
well pretty soon the whole town was there squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look but people that had the places wouldn t give them up and folks behind them was saying all the time say now you ve looked enough you fellows tain t right and tain t fair for you to stay thar all the time and never give nobody a chance other folks has their rights as well as you  
there was considerable jawing back so i slid out thinking maybe there was going to be trouble 
the streets was full and everybody was excited 
everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows stretching their necks and listening 
one long lanky man with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head and a crooked handled cane marked out the places on the ground where boggs stood and where sherburn stood and the people following him around from one place to t other and watching everything he done and bobbing their heads to show they understood and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane and then he stood up straight and stiff where sherburn had stood frowning and having his hat brim down over his eyes and sung out boggs  
and then fetched his cane down slow to a level and says bang  
staggered backwards says bang  
again and fell down flat on his back 
the people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect said it was just exactly the way it all happened 
then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him 
well by and by somebody said sherburn ought to be lynched 
in about a minute everybody was saying it so away they went mad and yelling and snatching down every clothes line they come to to do the hanging with 
chapter xxii 
they swarmed up towards sherburn s house a whooping and raging like injuns and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush and it was awful to see 
children was heeling it ahead of the mob screaming and trying to get out of the way and every window along the road was full of women s heads and there was nigger boys in every tree and bucks and wenches looking over every fence and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach 
lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on scared most to death 
they swarmed up in front of sherburn s palings as thick as they could jam together and you couldn t hear yourself think for the noise 
it was a little twenty foot yard 
some sung out tear down the fence 
tear down the fence  
then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing and down she goes and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave 
just then sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch with a double barrel gun in his hand and takes his stand perfectly ca m and deliberate not saying a word 
the racket stopped and the wave sucked back 
sherburn never said a word  just stood there looking down 
the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable 
sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out gaze him but they couldn t they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky 
then pretty soon sherburn sort of laughed not the pleasant kind but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that s got sand in it 
then he says slow and scornful  the idea of  you  lynching anybody 
it s amusing 
the idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a  man 
because you re brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast out women that come along here did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man 
why a  man s  safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind  as long as it s daytime and you re not behind him 
 do i know you 
i know you clear through 
i was born and raised in the south and i ve lived in the north so i know the average all around 
the average man s a coward 
in the north he lets anybody walk over him that wants to and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it 
in the south one man all by himself has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime and robbed the lot 
your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people  whereas you re just  as  brave and no braver 
why don t your juries hang murderers 
because they re afraid the man s friends will shoot them in the back in the dark  and it s just what they  would  do 
 so they always acquit and then a  man  goes in the night with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal 
your mistake is that you didn t bring a man with you that s one mistake and the other is that you didn t come in the dark and fetch your masks 
you brought  part  of a man  buck harkness there  and if you hadn t had him to start you you d a taken it out in blowing 
 you didn t want to come 
the average man don t like trouble and danger 
you  don t like trouble and danger 
but if only  half  a man  like buck harkness there  shouts lynch him 
lynch him  
you re afraid to back down  afraid you ll be found out to be what you are  cowards  and so you raise a yell and hang yourselves on to that half a man s coat tail and come raging up here swearing what big things you re going to do 
the pitifulest thing out is a mob that s what an army is  a mob they don t fight with courage that s born in them but with courage that s borrowed from their mass and from their officers 
but a mob without any  man  at the head of it is  beneath  pitifulness 
now the thing for  you  to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole 
if any real lynching s going to be done it will be done in the dark southern fashion and when they come they ll bring their masks and fetch a  man  along 
now  leave  and take your half a man with you   tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this 
the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck harkness he heeled it after them looking tolerable cheap 
i could a stayed if i wanted to but i didn t want to 
i went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by and then dived in under the tent 
i had my twenty dollar gold piece and some other money but i reckoned i better save it because there ain t no telling how soon you are going to need it away from home and amongst strangers that way 
you can t be too careful 
i ain t opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain t no other way but there ain t no use in  wasting  it on them 
it was a real bully circus 
it was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in two and two a gentleman and lady side by side the men just in their drawers and undershirts and no shoes nor stirrups and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable  there must a been twenty of them  and every lady with a lovely complexion and perfectly beautiful and looking just like a gang of real sure enough queens and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars and just littered with diamonds 
it was a powerful fine sight i never see anything so lovely 
and then one by one they got up and stood and went a weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight with their heads bobbing and skimming along away up there under the tent roof and every lady s rose leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips and she looking like the most loveliest parasol 
and then faster and faster they went all of them dancing first one foot out in the air and then the other the horses leaning more and more and the ringmaster going round and round the center pole cracking his whip and shouting hi   hi  
and the clown cracking jokes behind him and by and by all hands dropped the reins and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves 
and so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring and made the sweetest bow i ever see and then scampered out and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild 
well all through the circus they done the most astonishing things and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people 
the ringmaster couldn t ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said and how he ever could  think of so many of them and so sudden and so pat was what i couldn t noway understand 
why i couldn t a thought of them in a year 
and by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring  said he wanted to ride said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was 
they argued and tried to keep him out but he wouldn t listen and the whole show come to a standstill 
then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him and that made him mad and he begun to rip and tear so that stirred up the people and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring saying knock him down 
throw him out  
and one or two women begun to scream 
so then the ringmaster he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn t be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn t make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse 
so everybody laughed and said all right and the man got on 
the minute he was on the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him and the drunk man hanging on to his neck and his heels flying in the air every jump and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down 
and at last sure enough all the circus men could do the horse broke loose and away he went like the very nation round and round the ring with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side and then t other one on t other side and the people just crazy 
it warn t funny to me though i was all of a tremble to see his danger 
but pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle a reeling this way and that and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood 
and the horse a going like a house afire too 
he just stood up there a sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn t ever drunk in his life  and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them 
he shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits 
and then there he was slim and handsome and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum  and finally skipped off and made his bow and danced off to the dressing room and everybody just a howling with pleasure and astonishment 
then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled and he  was  the sickest ringmaster you ever see i reckon 
why it was one of his own men 
he had got up that joke all out of his own head and never let on to nobody 
well i felt sheepish enough to be took in so but i wouldn t a been in that ringmaster s place not for a thousand dollars 
i don t know there may be bullier circuses than what that one was but i never struck them yet 
anyways it was plenty good enough for  me  and wherever i run across it it can have all of  my  custom every time 
well that night we had  our  show but there warn t only about twelve people there  just enough to pay expenses 
and they laughed all the time and that made the duke mad and everybody left anyway before the show was over but one boy which was asleep 
so the duke said these arkansaw lunkheads couldn t come up to shakespeare what they wanted was low comedy  and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy he reckoned 
he said he could size their style 
so next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint and drawed off some handbills and stuck them up all over the village 
the bills said     chapter xxiii 
well all day him and the king was hard at it rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights and that night the house was jam full of men in no time 
when the place couldn t hold no more the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech and praised up this tragedy and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was and so he went on a bragging about the tragedy and about edmund kean the elder which was to play the main principal part in it and at last when he d got everybody s expectations up high enough he rolled up the curtain and the next minute the king come a prancing out on all fours naked and he was painted all over ring streaked and striped all sorts of colors as splendid as a rainbow 
and  but never mind the rest of his outfit it was just wild but it was awful funny 
the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and haw hawed till he come back and done it over again and after that they made him do it another time 
well it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut 
then the duke he lets the curtain down and bows to the people and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more on accounts of pressing london engagements where the seats is all sold already for it in drury lane and then he makes them another bow and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it 
twenty people sings out  what is it over 
is that  all  
the duke says yes 
then there was a fine time 
everybody sings out sold  
and rose up mad and was a going for that stage and them tragedians 
but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts  hold on 
just a word gentlemen  
they stopped to listen 
 we are sold  mighty badly sold 
but we don t want to be the laughing stock of this whole town i reckon and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live 
no 
what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this show up and sell the  rest  of the town 
then we ll all be in the same boat 
ain t that sensible  
  you bet it is   the jedge is right  
everybody sings out  
 all right then  not a word about any sell 
go along home and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy  
next day you couldn t hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was 
house was jammed again that night and we sold this crowd the same way 
when me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper and by and by about midnight they made jim and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town 
the third night the house was crammed again  and they warn t new comers this time but people that was at the show the other two nights 
i stood by the duke at the door and i see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging or something muffled up under his coat  and i see it warn t no perfumery neither not by a long sight 
i smelt sickly eggs by the barrel and rotten cabbages and such things and if i know the signs of a dead cat being around and i bet i do there was sixty four of them went in 
i shoved in there for a minute but it was too various for me i couldn t stand it 
well when the place couldn t hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute and then he started around for the stage door i after him but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says  walk fast now till you get away from the houses and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you  
i done it and he done the same 
we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream all dark and still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word 
i reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience but nothing of the sort pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam and says  well how d the old thing pan out this time duke  
he hadn t been up town at all 
we never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village 
then we lit up and had a supper and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they d served them people 
the duke says  greenhorns flatheads 
i knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in and i knew they d lay for us the third night and consider it was  their  turn now 
well it  is  their turn and i d give something to know how much they d take for it 
i would  just like to know how they re putting in their opportunity 
they can turn it into a picnic if they want to  they brought plenty provisions  
them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty five dollars in that three nights 
i never see money hauled in by the wagon load like that before 
by and by when they was asleep and snoring jim says  don t it s prise you de way dem kings carries on huck  
 no  i says it don t  
 why don t it huck  
 well it don t because it s in the breed 
i reckon they re all alike  
 but huck dese kings o ourn is reglar rapscallions dat s jist what dey is dey s reglar rapscallions  
 well that s what i m a saying all kings is mostly rapscallions as fur as i can make out  
 is dat so  
 you read about them once  you ll see 
look at henry the eight this n s a sunday school superintendent to  him 
and look at charles second and louis fourteen and louis fifteen and james second and edward second and richard third and forty more besides all them saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise cain 
my you ought to seen old henry the eight when he was in bloom 
he  was  a blossom 
he used to marry a new wife every day and chop off her head next morning 
and he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs 
 fetch up nell gwynn  he says 
they fetch her up 
next morning chop off her head  
and they chop it off 
 fetch up jane shore  he says and up she comes next morning chop off her head   and they chop it off 
 ring up fair rosamun  
fair rosamun answers the bell 
next morning chop off her head  
and he made every one of them tell him a tale every night and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way and then he put them all in a book and called it domesday book  which was a good name and stated the case 
you don t know kings jim but i know them and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest i ve struck in history 
well henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country 
how does he go at it  give notice   give the country a show 
no 
all of a sudden he heaves all the tea in boston harbor overboard and whacks out a declaration of independence and dares them to come on 
that was his  style  he never give anybody a chance 
he had suspicions of his father the duke of wellington 
well what did he do 
ask him to show up 
no  drownded him in a butt of mamsey like a cat 
s pose people left money laying around where he was  what did he do 
he collared it 
s pose he contracted to do a thing and you paid him and didn t set down there and see that he done it  what did he do 
he always done the other thing 
s pose he opened his mouth  what then 
if he didn t shut it up powerful quick he d lose a lie every time 
that s the kind of a bug henry was and if we d a had him along stead of our kings he d a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done 
i don t say that ourn is lambs because they ain t when you come right down to the cold facts but they ain t nothing to  that  old ram anyway 
all i say is kings is kings and you got to make allowances 
take them all around they re a mighty ornery lot 
it s the way they re raised  
 but dis one do  smell  so like de nation huck  
 well they all do jim 
we can t help the way a king smells history don t tell no way  
 now de duke he s a tolerble likely man in some ways  
 yes a duke s different 
but not very different 
this one s a middling hard lot for a duke 
when he s drunk there ain t no near sighted man could tell him from a king  
 well anyways i doan hanker for no mo un um huck 
dese is all i kin stan   
 it s the way i feel too jim 
but we ve got them on our hands and we got to remember what they are and make allowances 
sometimes i wish we could hear of a country that s out of kings  
what was the use to tell jim these warn t real kings and dukes 
it wouldn t a done no good and besides it was just as i said you couldn t tell them from the real kind 
i went to sleep and jim didn t call me when it was my turn 
he often done that 
when i waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees moaning and mourning to himself 
i didn t take notice nor let on 
i knowed what it was about 
he was thinking about his wife and his children away up yonder and he was low and homesick because he hadn t ever been away from home before in his life and i do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their n 
it don t seem natural but i reckon it s so 
he was often moaning and mourning that way nights when he judged i was asleep and saying po little lizabeth 
po little johnny 
it s mighty hard i spec i ain t ever gwyne to see you no mo  no mo   
he was a mighty good nigger jim was 
but this time i somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones and by and by he says  what makes me feel so bad dis time uz bekase i hear sumpn over yonder on de bank like a whack er a slam while ago en it mine me er de time i treat my little lizabeth so ornery

chapter xxiv 
next day towards night we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle where there was a village on each side of the river and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns 
jim he spoke to the duke and said he hoped it wouldn t take but a few hours because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope 
you see when we left him all alone we had to tie him because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn t look much like he was a runaway nigger you know 
so the duke said it  was  kind of hard to have to lay roped all day and he d cipher out some way to get around it 
he was uncommon bright the duke was and he soon struck it 
he dressed jim up in king lear s outfit  it was a long curtain calico gown and a white horse hair wig and whiskers and then he took his theater paint and painted jim s face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead dull solid blue like a man that s been drownded nine days 
blamed if he warn t the horriblest looking outrage i ever see 
then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so  sick arab  but harmless when not out of his head 
and he nailed that shingle to a lath and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam 
jim was satisfied 
he said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day and trembling all over every time there was a sound 
the duke told him to make himself free and easy and if anybody ever come meddling around he must hop out of the wigwam and carry on a little and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone 
which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldn t wait for him to howl 
why he didn t only look like he was dead he looked considerable more than that 
these rapscallions wanted to try the nonesuch again because there was so much money in it but they judged it wouldn t be safe because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time 
they couldn t hit no project that suited exactly so at last the duke said he reckoned he d lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn t put up something on the arkansaw village and the king he allowed he would drop over to t other village without any plan but just trust in providence to lead him the profitable way  meaning the devil i reckon 
we had all bought store clothes where we stopped last and now the king put his n on and he told me to put mine on 
i done it of course 
the king s duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy 
i never knowed how clothes could change a body before 
why before he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when he d take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good and pious that you d say he had walked right out of the ark and maybe was old leviticus himself 
jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my paddle ready 
there was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point about three mile above the town  been there a couple of hours taking on freight 
says the king  seein how i m dressed i reckon maybe i better arrive down from st louis or cincinnati or some other big place 
go for the steamboat huckleberry we ll come down to the village on her  
i didn t have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride 
i fetched the shore a half a mile above the village and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water 
pretty soon we come to a nice innocent looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face for it was powerful warm weather and he had a couple of big carpet bags by him 
 run her nose in shore  says the king 
i done it 
 wher you bound for young man  
 for the steamboat going to orleans  
 git aboard  says the king 
 hold on a minute my servant ll he p you with them bags 
jump out and he p the gentleman adolphus   meaning me i see 
i done so and then we all three started on again 
the young chap was mighty thankful said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather 
he asked the king where he was going and the king told him he d come down the river and landed at the other village this morning and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there 
the young fellow says  when i first see you i says to myself it s mr wilks sure and he come mighty near getting here in time  
but then i says again no i reckon it ain t him or else he wouldn t be paddling up the river  
you ain t  him are you  
 no my name s blodgett  elexander blodgett  reverend  elexander blodgett i s pose i must say as i m one o the lord s poor servants 
but still i m jist as able to be sorry for mr wilks for not arriving in time all the same if he s missed anything by it  which i hope he hasn t  
 well he don t miss any property by it because he ll get that all right but he s missed seeing his brother peter die  which he mayn t mind nobody can tell as to that  but his brother would a give anything in this world to see  him  before he died never talked about nothing else all these three weeks hadn t seen him since they was boys together  and hadn t ever seen his brother william at all  that s the deef and dumb one  william ain t more than thirty or thirty five 
peter and george were the only ones that come out here george was the married brother him and his wife both died last year 
harvey and william s the only ones that s left now and as i was saying they haven t got here in time  
 did anybody send em word  
 oh yes a month or two ago when peter was first took because peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn t going to get well this time 
you see he was pretty old and george s g yirls was too young to be much company for him except mary jane the red headed one and so he was kinder lonesome after george and his wife died and didn t seem to care much to live 
he most desperately wanted to see harvey  and william too for that matter  because he was one of them kind that can t bear to make a will 
he left a letter behind for harvey and said he d told in it where his money was hid and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so george s g yirls would be all right  for george didn t leave nothing 
and that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to  
 why do you reckon harvey don t come 
wher does he live  
 oh he lives in england  sheffield  preaches there  hasn t ever been in this country 
he hasn t had any too much time  and besides he mightn t a got the letter at all you know  
 too bad too bad he couldn t a lived to see his brothers poor soul 
you going to orleans you say  
 yes but that ain t only a part of it 
i m going in a ship next wednesday for ryo janeero where my uncle lives  
 it s a pretty long journey 
but it ll be lovely wisht i was a going 
is mary jane the oldest 
how old is the others  
 mary jane s nineteen susan s fifteen and joanna s about fourteen  that s the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare lip  
 poor things 
to be left alone in the cold world so  
 well they could be worse off 
old peter had friends and they ain t going to let them come to no harm 
there s hobson the babtis preacher and deacon lot hovey and ben rucker and abner shackleford and levi bell the lawyer and dr robinson and their wives and the widow bartley and  well there s a lot of them but these are the ones that peter was thickest with and used to write about sometimes when he wrote home so harvey ll know where to look for friends when he gets here  
well the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow 
blamed if he didn t inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the wilkses and about peter s business  which was a tanner and about george s  which was a carpenter and about harvey s  which was a dissentering minister and so on and so on 
then he says  what did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for  
 because she s a big orleans boat and i was afeard she mightn t stop there 
when they re deep they won t stop for a hail 
a cincinnati boat will but this is a st louis one  
 was peter wilks well off  
 oh yes pretty well off 
he had houses and land and it s reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som ers  
 when did you say he died  
 i didn t say but it was last night  
 funeral to morrow likely  
 yes bout the middle of the day  
 well it s all terrible sad but we ve all got to go one time or another 
so what we want to do is to be prepared then we re all right  
 yes sir it s the best way 
ma used to always say that  
when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got off 
the king never said nothing about going aboard so i lost my ride after all 
when the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place and then he got ashore and says  now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpet bags 
and if he s gone over to t other side go over there and git him 
and tell him to git himself up regardless 
shove along now  
i see what  he  was up to but i never said nothing of course 
when i got back with the duke we hid the canoe and then they set down on a log and the king told him everything just like the young fellow had said it  every last word of it 
and all the time he was a doing it he tried to talk like an englishman and he done it pretty well too for a slouch 
i can t imitate him and so i ain t a going to try to but he really done it pretty good 
then he says  how are you on the deef and dumb bilgewater  
the duke said leave him alone for that said he had played a deef and dumb person on the histronic boards 
so then they waited for a steamboat 
about the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along but they didn t come from high enough up the river but at last there was a big one and they hailed her 
she sent out her yawl and we went aboard and she was from cincinnati and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad and gave us a cussing and said they wouldn t land us 
but the king was ca m 
he says  if gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl a steamboat kin afford to carry em can t it  
so they softened down and said it was all right and when we got to the village they yawled us ashore 
about two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl a coming and when the king says  kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher mr peter wilks lives  
they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say what d i tell you  
then one of them says kind of soft and gentle  i m sorry sir but the best we can do is to tell you where he  did  live yesterday evening  
sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash and fell up against the man and put his chin on his shoulder and cried down his back and says  alas alas our poor brother  gone and we never got to see him oh it s too too hard  
then he turns around blubbering and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands and blamed if he didn t drop a carpet bag and bust out a crying 
if they warn t the beatenest lot them two frauds that ever i struck 
well the men gathered around and sympathized with them and said all sorts of kind things to them and carried their carpet bags up the hill for them and let them lean on them and cry and told the king all about his brother s last moments and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke and both of them took on about that dead tanner like they d lost the twelve disciples 
well if ever i struck anything like it i m a nigger 
it was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race 
chapter xxv 
the news was all over town in two minutes and you could see the people tearing down on the run from every which way some of them putting on their coats as they come 
pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march 
the windows and dooryards was full and every minute somebody would say over a fence  is it  them  
and somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say  you bet it is  
when we got to the house the street in front of it was packed and the three girls was standing in the door 
mary jane  was  red headed but that don t make no difference she was most awful beautiful and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory she was so glad her uncles was come 
the king he spread his arms and mary jane she jumped for them and the hare lip jumped for the duke and there they had it 
everybody most leastways women cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good times 
then the king he hunched the duke private  i see him do it  and then he looked around and see the coffin over in the corner on two chairs so then him and the duke with a hand across each other s shoulder and t other hand to their eyes walked slow and solemn over there everybody dropping back to give them room and all the talk and noise stopping people saying sh  
and all the men taking their hats off and drooping their heads so you could a heard a pin fall 
and when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin and took one sight and then they bust out a crying so you could a heard them to orleans most and then they put their arms around each other s necks and hung their chins over each other s shoulders and then for three minutes or maybe four i never see two men leak the way they done 
and mind you everybody was doing the same and the place was that damp i never see anything like it 
then one of them got on one side of the coffin and t other on t other side and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin and let on to pray all to themselves 
well when it come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud  the poor girls too and every woman nearly went up to the girls without saying a word and kissed them solemn on the forehead and then put their hand on their head and looked up towards the sky with the tears running down and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing and give the next woman a show 
i never see anything so disgusting 
well by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little and works himself up and slobbers out a speech all full of tears and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the diseased and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile but it s a trial that s sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother s heart because out of their mouths they can t words being too weak and cold and all that kind of rot and slush till it was just sickening and then he blubbers out a pious goody goody amen and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust 
and the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer and everybody joined in with all their might and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out 
music is a good thing and after all that soul butter and hogwash i never see it freshen up things so and sound so honest and bully 
then the king begins to work his jaw again and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening and help set up with the ashes of the diseased and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who he would name for they was names that was very dear to him and mentioned often in his letters and so he will name the same to wit as follows vizz    rev 
mr hobson and deacon lot hovey and mr ben rucker and abner shackleford and levi bell and dr robinson and their wives and the widow bartley 
rev 
hobson and dr robinson was down to the end of the town a hunting together  that is i mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t other world and the preacher was pinting him right 
lawyer bell was away up to louisville on business 
but the rest was on hand and so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him and then they shook hands with the duke and didn t say nothing but just kept a smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said goo goo  goo goo goo all the time like a baby that can t talk 
so the king he blattered along and managed to inquire about pretty much everybody and dog in town by his name and mentioned all sorts of little things that happened one time or another in the town or to george s family or to peter 
and he always let on that peter wrote him the things but that was a lie he got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat 
then mary jane she fetched the letter her father left behind and the king he read it out loud and cried over it 
it give the dwelling house and three thousand dollars gold to the girls and it give the tanyard which was doing a good business  along with some other houses and land worth about seven thousand  and three thousand dollars in gold to harvey and william and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar 
so these two frauds said they d go and fetch it up and have everything square and above board and told me to come with a candle 
we shut the cellar door behind us and when they found the bag they spilt it out on the floor and it was a lovely sight all them yaller boys 
my the way the king s eyes did shine 
he slaps the duke on the shoulder and says  oh  this  ain t bully nor noth n 
oh no i reckon not 
why bully  it beats the nonesuch  don t  it  
the duke allowed it did 
they pawed the yaller boys and sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor and the king says  it ain t no use talkin  bein brothers to a rich dead man and representatives of furrin heirs that s got left is the line for you and me bilge 
thish yer comes of trust n to providence 
it s the best way in the long run 
i ve tried em all and ther ain t no better way  
most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile and took it on trust but no they must count it 
so they counts it and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short 
says the king  dern him i wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen dollars  
they worried over that awhile and ransacked all around for it 
then the duke says  well he was a pretty sick man and likely he made a mistake  i reckon that s the way of it 
the best way s to let it go and keep still about it 
we can spare it  
 oh shucks yes we can  spare  it 
i don t k yer noth n bout that  it s the  count  i m thinkin about 
we want to be awful square and open and above board here you know 
we want to lug this h yer money up stairs and count it before everybody  then ther ain t noth n suspicious 
but when the dead man says ther s six thous n dollars you know we don t want to    hold on  says the duke 
 le s make up the deffisit  and he begun to haul out yaller boys out of his pocket 
 it s a most amaz n good idea duke  you  have  got a rattlin clever head on you  says the king 
 blest if the old nonesuch ain t a heppin us out agin  and  he  begun to haul out yaller jackets and stack them up 
it most busted them but they made up the six thousand clean and clear 
 say  says the duke i got another idea 
le s go up stairs and count this money and then take and  give it to the girls  
 good land duke lemme hug you 
it s the most dazzling idea at ever a man struck 
you have cert nly got the most astonishin head i ever see 
oh this is the boss dodge ther ain t no mistake bout it 
let em fetch along their suspicions now if they want to  this ll lay em out  
when we got up stairs everybody gethered around the table and the king he counted it and stacked it up three hundred dollars in a pile  twenty elegant little piles 
everybody looked hungry at it and licked their chops 
then they raked it into the bag again and i see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech 
he says  friends all my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them that s left behind in the vale of sorrers 
he has done generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered and that s left fatherless and motherless 
yes and we that knowed him knows that he would a done  more  generous by em if he hadn t ben afeard o woundin his dear william and me 
now  wouldn t  he 
ther ain t no question bout it in  my  mind 
well then what kind o brothers would it be that d stand in his way at sech a time 
and what kind o uncles would it be that d rob  yes  rob  sech poor sweet lambs as these at he loved so at sech a time 
if i know william  and i  think  i do  he  well i ll jest ask him  
he turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his hands and the duke he looks at him stupid and leather headed a while then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning and jumps for the king goo gooing with all his might for joy and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up 
then the king says i knowed it i reckon  that ll  convince anybody the way  he  feels about it 
here mary jane susan joanner take the money  take it all 
it s the gift of him that lays yonder cold but joyful  
mary jane she went for him susan and the hare lip went for the duke and then such another hugging and kissing i never see yet 
and everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes and most shook the hands off of them frauds saying all the time  you  dear  good souls   how  lovely   how  could  you  
well then pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again and how good he was and what a loss he was and all that and before long a big iron jawed man worked himself in there from outside and stood a listening and looking and not saying anything and nobody saying anything to him either because the king was talking and they was all busy listening 
the king was saying  in the middle of something he d started in on     they bein partickler friends o the diseased 
that s why they re invited here this evenin  but tomorrow we want  all  to come  everybody for he respected everybody he liked everybody and so it s fitten that his funeral orgies sh d be public  
and so he went a mooning on and on liking to hear himself talk and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again till the duke he couldn t stand it no more so he writes on a little scrap of paper  obsequies  you old fool  and folds it up and goes to goo gooing and reaching it over people s heads to him 
the king he reads it and puts it in his pocket and says  poor william afflicted as he is his  heart s  aluz right 
asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeral  wants me to make em all welcome 
but he needn t a worried  it was jest what i was at  
then he weaves along again perfectly ca m and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then just like he done before 
and when he done it the third time he says  i say orgies not because it s the common term because it ain t  obsequies bein the common term  but because orgies is the right term 
obsequies ain t used in england no more now  it s gone out 
we say orgies now in england 
orgies is better because it means the thing you re after more exact 
it s a word that s made up out n the greek orgo  outside open abroad and the hebrew  jeesum  to plant cover up hence in ter 
so you see funeral orgies is an open er public funeral  
he was the  worst  i ever struck 
well the iron jawed man he laughed right in his face 
everybody was shocked 
everybody says why doctor  
and abner shackleford says  why robinson hain t you heard the news 
this is harvey wilks  
the king he smiled eager and shoved out his flapper and says  is it my poor brother s dear good friend and physician 
i    keep your hands off of me  
says the doctor  
you  talk like an englishman  don t  you 
it s the worst imitation i ever heard 
you  peter wilks s brother 
you re a fraud that s what you are  
well how they all took on 
they crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him down and tried to explain to him and tell him how harvey d showed in forty ways that he  was  harvey and knowed everybody by name and the names of the very dogs and begged and  begged  him not to hurt harvey s feelings and the poor girl s feelings and all that 
but it warn t no use he stormed right along and said any man that pretended to be an englishman and couldn t imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar 
the poor girls was hanging to the king and crying and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on  them 
he says  i was your father s friend and i m your friend and i warn you as a friend and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm and trouble to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with him the ignorant tramp with his idiotic greek and hebrew as he calls it 
he is the thinnest kind of an impostor  has come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres and you take them for  proofs  and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here who ought to know better 
mary jane wilks you know me for your friend and for your unselfish friend too 
now listen to me turn this pitiful rascal out  i  beg  you to do it 
will you  
mary jane straightened herself up and my but she was handsome 
she says   here  is my answer  
she hove up the bag of money and put it in the king s hands and says take this six thousand dollars and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to and don t give us no receipt for it  
then she put her arm around the king on one side and susan and the hare lip done the same on the other 
everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud 
the doctor says  all right i wash  my  hands of the matter 
but i warn you all that a time s coming when you re going to feel sick whenever you think of this day  
and away he went 
 all right doctor  says the king kinder mocking him we ll try and get em to send for you  which made them all laugh and they said it was a prime good hit 
chapter xxvi 
well when they was all gone the king he asks mary jane how they was off for spare rooms and she said she had one spare room which would do for uncle william and she d give her own room to uncle harvey which was a little bigger and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot and up garret was a little cubby with a pallet in it 
the king said the cubby would do for his valley  meaning me 
so mary jane took us up and she showed them their rooms which was plain but nice 
she said she d have her frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her room if they was in uncle harvey s way but he said they warn t 
the frocks was hung along the wall and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor 
there was an old hair trunk in one corner and a guitar box in another and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around like girls brisken up a room with 
the king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings and so don t disturb them 
the duke s room was pretty small but plenty good enough and so was my cubby 
that night they had a big supper and all them men and women was there and i stood behind the king and the duke s chairs and waited on them and the niggers waited on the rest 
mary jane she set at the head of the table with susan alongside of her and said how bad the biscuits was and how mean the preserves was and how ornery and tough the fried chickens was  and all that kind of rot the way women always do for to force out compliments and the people all knowed everything was tiptop and said so  said how  do  you get biscuits to brown so nice  
and where for the land s sake  did  you get these amaz n pickles  
and all that kind of humbug talky talk just the way people always does at a supper you know 
and when it was all done me and the hare lip had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the things 
the hare lip she got to pumping me about england and blest if i didn t think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes 
she says  did you ever see the king  
 who 
william fourth 
well i bet i have  he goes to our church  
i knowed he was dead years ago but i never let on 
so when i says he goes to our church she says  what  regular  
 yes  regular 
his pew s right over opposite ourn  on t other side the pulpit  
 i thought he lived in london  
 well he does 
where  would  he live  
 but i thought  you  lived in sheffield  
i see i was up a stump 
i had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone so as to get time to think how to get down again 
then i says  i mean he goes to our church regular when he s in sheffield 
that s only in the summer time when he comes there to take the sea baths  
 why how you talk  sheffield ain t on the sea  
 well who said it was  
 why you did  
 i  didn t  nuther  
 you did  
 i didn t  
 you did  
 i never said nothing of the kind  
 well what  did  you say then  
 said he come to take the sea  baths  that s what i said  
 well then how s he going to take the sea baths if it ain t on the sea  
 looky here  i says did you ever see any congress water  
 yes  
 well did you have to go to congress to get it  
 why no  
 well neither does william fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath  
 how does he get it then  
 gets it the way people down here gets congress water  in barrels 
there in the palace at sheffield they ve got furnaces and he wants his water hot 
they can t bile that amount of water away off there at the sea 
they haven t got no conveniences for it  
 oh i see now 
you might a said that in the first place and saved time  
when she said that i see i was out of the woods again and so i was comfortable and glad 
next she says  do you go to church too  
 yes  regular  
 where do you set  
 why in our pew  
 whose  pew  
 why  ourn  your uncle harvey s  
 his n 
what does  he  want with a pew  
 wants it to set in 
what did you  reckon  he wanted with it  
 why i thought he d be in the pulpit  
rot him i forgot he was a preacher 
i see i was up a stump again so i played another chicken bone and got another think 
then i says  blame it do you suppose there ain t but one preacher to a church  
 why what do they want with more  
 what   to preach before a king 
i never did see such a girl as you 
they don t have no less than seventeen  
 seventeen 
my land 
why i wouldn t set out such a string as that not if i  never  got to glory 
it must take em a week  
 shucks they don t  all  of em preach the same day  only  one  of em  
 well then what does the rest of em do  
 oh nothing much 
loll around pass the plate  and one thing or another 
but mainly they don t do nothing  
 well then what are they  for  
 why they re for  style 
don t you know nothing  
 well i don t  want  to know no such foolishness as that 
how is servants treated in england 
do they treat em better n we treat our niggers  
 no 
a servant ain t nobody there 
they treat them worse than dogs  
 don t they give em holidays the way we do christmas and new year s week and fourth of july  
 oh just listen 
a body could tell  you  hain t ever been to england by that 
why hare l  why joanna they never see a holiday from year s end to year s end never go to the circus nor theater nor nigger shows nor nowheres  
 nor church  
 nor church  
 but  you  always went to church  
well i was gone up again 
i forgot i was the old man s servant 
but next minute i whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and  had  to go to church whether he wanted to or not and set with the family on account of its being the law 
but i didn t do it pretty good and when i got done i see she warn t satisfied 
she says  honest injun now hain t you been telling me a lot of lies  
 honest injun  says i 
 none of it at all  
 none of it at all 
not a lie in it  says i 
 lay your hand on this book and say it  
i see it warn t nothing but a dictionary so i laid my hand on it and said it 
so then she looked a little better satisfied and says  well then i ll believe some of it but i hope to gracious if i ll believe the rest  
 what is it you won t believe joe  
says mary jane stepping in with susan behind her 
 it ain t right nor kind for you to talk so to him and him a stranger and so far from his people 
how would you like to be treated so  
 that s always your way maim  always sailing in to help somebody before they re hurt 
i hain t done nothing to him 
he s told some stretchers i reckon and i said i wouldn t swallow it all and that s every bit and grain i  did  say 
i reckon he can stand a little thing like that can t he  
 i don t care whether twas little or whether twas big he s here in our house and a stranger and it wasn t good of you to say it 
if you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed and so you oughtn t to say a thing to another person that will make  them  feel ashamed  
 why mam he said    it don t make no difference what he  said  that ain t the thing 
the thing is for you to treat him  kind  and not be saying things to make him remember he ain t in his own country and amongst his own folks  
i says to myself  this  is a girl that i m letting that old reptile rob her of her money 
then susan  she  waltzed in and if you ll believe me she did give hare lip hark from the tomb 
says i to myself and this is  another  one that i m letting him rob her of her money 
then mary jane she took another inning and went in sweet and lovely again  which was her way but when she got done there warn t hardly anything left o poor hare lip 
so she hollered 
 all right then  says the other girls you just ask his pardon  
she done it too and she done it beautiful 
she done it so beautiful it was good to hear and i wished i could tell her a thousand lies so she could do it again 
i says to myself this is  another  one that i m letting him rob her of her money 
and when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know i was amongst friends 
i felt so ornery and low down and mean that i says to myself my mind s made up i ll hive that money for them or bust 
so then i lit out  for bed i said meaning some time or another 
when i got by myself i went to thinking the thing over 
i says to myself shall i go to that doctor private and blow on these frauds 
no  that won t do 
he might tell who told him then the king and the duke would make it warm for me 
shall i go private and tell mary jane 
no  i dasn t do it 
her face would give them a hint sure they ve got the money and they d slide right out and get away with it 
if she was to fetch in help i d get mixed up in the business before it was done with i judge 
no there ain t no good way but one 
i got to steal that money somehow and i got to steal it some way that they won t suspicion that i done it 
they ve got a good thing here and they ain t a going to leave till they ve played this family and this town for all they re worth so i ll find a chance time enough 
i ll steal it and hide it and by and by when i m away down the river i ll write a letter and tell mary jane where it s hid 
but i better hive it tonight if i can because the doctor maybe hasn t let up as much as he lets on he has he might scare them out of here yet 
so thinks i i ll go and search them rooms 
upstairs the hall was dark but i found the duke s room and started to paw around it with my hands but i recollected it wouldn t be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self so then i went to his room and begun to paw around there 
but i see i couldn t do nothing without a candle and i dasn t light one of course 
so i judged i d got to do the other thing  lay for them and eavesdrop 
about that time i hears their footsteps coming and was going to skip under the bed i reached for it but it wasn t where i thought it would be but i touched the curtain that hid mary jane s frocks so i jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns and stood there perfectly still 
they come in and shut the door and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed 
then i was glad i hadn t found the bed when i wanted it 
and yet you know it s kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private 
they sets down then and the king says  well what is it 
and cut it middlin short because it s better for us to be down there a whoopin up the mournin than up here givin em a chance to talk us over  
 well this is it capet 
i ain t easy i ain t comfortable 
that doctor lays on my mind 
i wanted to know your plans 
i ve got a notion and i think it s a sound one  
 what is it duke  
 that we better glide out of this before three in the morning and clip it down the river with what we ve got 
specially seeing we got it so easy  given  back to us flung at our heads as you may say when of course we allowed to have to steal it back 
i m for knocking off and lighting out  
that made me feel pretty bad 
about an hour or two ago it would a been a little different but now it made me feel bad and disappointed the king rips out and says  what 
and not sell out the rest o the property 
march off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous n dollars worth o property layin around jest sufferin to be scooped in   and all good salable stuff too  
the duke he grumbled said the bag of gold was enough and he didn t want to go no deeper  didn t want to rob a lot of orphans of  everything  they had 
 why how you talk  
says the king 
 we sha n t rob em of nothing at all but jest this money 
the people that  buys  the property is the suff rers because as soon s it s found out at we didn t own it  which won t be long after we ve slid  the sale won t be valid and it ll all go back to the estate 
these yer orphans ll git their house back agin and that s enough for  them  they re young and spry and k n easy earn a livin  
they  ain t a goin to suffer 
why jest think  there s thous n s and thous n s that ain t nigh so well off 
bless you  they  ain t got noth n to complain of  
well the king he talked him blind so at last he give in and said all right but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay and that doctor hanging over them 
but the king says  cuss the doctor 
what do we k yer for  him 
hain t we got all the fools in town on our side 
and ain t that a big enough majority in any town  
so they got ready to go down stairs again 
the duke says  i don t think we put that money in a good place  
that cheered me up 
i d begun to think i warn t going to get a hint of no kind to help me 
the king says  why  
 because mary jane ll be in mourning from this out and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put em away and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it  
 your head s level agin duke  says the king and he comes a fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where i was 
i stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still though quivery and i wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me and i tried to think what i d better do if they did catch me 
but the king he got the bag before i could think more than about a half a thought and he never suspicioned i was around 
they took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather bed and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now because a nigger only makes up the feather bed and don t turn over the straw tick only about twice a year and so it warn t in no danger of getting stole now 
but i knowed better 
i had it out of there before they was half way down stairs 
i groped along up to my cubby and hid it there till i could get a chance to do better 
i judged i better hide it outside of the house somewheres because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking i knowed that very well 
then i turned in with my clothes all on but i couldn t a gone to sleep if i d a wanted to i was in such a sweat to get through with the business 
by and by i heard the king and the duke come up so i rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder and waited to see if anything was going to happen 
but nothing did 
so i held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn t begun yet and then i slipped down the ladder 
chapter xxvii 
i crept to their doors and listened they was snoring 
so i tiptoed along and got down stairs all right 
there warn t a sound anywheres 
i peeped through a crack of the dining room door and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs 
the door was open into the parlor where the corpse was laying and there was a candle in both rooms 
i passed along and the parlor door was open but i see there warn t nobody in there but the remainders of peter so i shoved on by but the front door was locked and the key wasn t there 
just then i heard somebody coming down the stairs back behind me 
i run in the parlor and took a swift look around and the only place i see to hide the bag was in the coffin 
the lid was shoved along about a foot showing the dead man s face down in there with a wet cloth over it and his shroud on 
i tucked the money bag in under the lid just down beyond where his hands was crossed which made me creep they was so cold and then i run back across the room and in behind the door 
the person coming was mary jane 
she went to the coffin very soft and kneeled down and looked in then she put up her handkerchief and i see she begun to cry though i couldn t hear her and her back was to me 
i slid out and as i passed the dining room i thought i d make sure them watchers hadn t seen me so i looked through the crack and everything was all right 
they hadn t stirred 
i slipped up to bed feeling ruther blue on accounts of the thing playing out that way after i had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it 
says i if it could stay where it is all right because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two i could write back to mary jane and she could dig him up again and get it but that ain t the thing that s going to happen the thing that s going to happen is the money ll be found when they come to screw on the lid 
then the king ll get it again and it ll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him 
of course i  wanted  to slide down and get it out of there but i dasn t try it 
every minute it was getting earlier now and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir and i might get catched  catched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadn t hired me to take care of 
i don t wish to be mixed up in no such business as that i says to myself 
when i got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up and the watchers was gone 
there warn t nobody around but the family and the widow bartley and our tribe 
i watched their faces to see if anything had been happening but i couldn t tell 
towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs and then set all our chairs in rows and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the dining room was full 
i see the coffin lid was the way it was before but i dasn t go to look in under it with folks around 
then the people begun to flock in and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin and for a half an hour the people filed around slow in single rank and looked down at the dead man s face a minute and some dropped in a tear and it was all very still and solemn only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent and sobbing a little 
there warn t no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing noses  because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church 
when the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways putting on the last touches and getting people and things all ship shape and comfortable and making no more sound than a cat 
he never spoke he moved people around he squeezed in late ones he opened up passageways and done it with nods and signs with his hands 
then he took his place over against the wall 
he was the softest glidingest stealthiest man i ever see and there warn t no more smile to him than there is to a ham 
they had borrowed a melodeum  a sick one and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it and it was pretty skreeky and colicky and everybody joined in and sung and peter was the only one that had a good thing according to my notion 
then the reverend hobson opened up slow and solemn and begun to talk and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard it was only one dog but he made a most powerful racket and he kept it up right along the parson he had to stand there over the coffin and wait  you couldn t hear yourself think 
it was right down awkward and nobody didn t seem to know what to do 
but pretty soon they see that long legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say don t you worry  just depend on me  
then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall just his shoulders showing over the people s heads 
so he glided along and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time and at last when he had gone around two sides of the room he disappears down cellar 
then in about two seconds we heard a whack and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two and then everything was dead still and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off 
in a minute or two here comes this undertaker s back and shoulders gliding along the wall again and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room and then rose up and shaded his mouth with his hands and stretched his neck out towards the preacher over the people s heads and says in a kind of a coarse whisper  he had a rat  
then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place 
you could see it was a great satisfaction to the people because naturally they wanted to know 
a little thing like that don t cost nothing and it s just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked 
there warn t no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was 
well the funeral sermon was very good but pison long and tiresome and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage and at last the job was through and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screw driver 
i was in a sweat then and watched him pretty keen 
but he never meddled at all just slid the lid along as soft as mush and screwed it down tight and fast 
so there i was 
i didn t know whether the money was in there or not 
so says i s pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly   now how do i know whether to write to mary jane or not 
s pose she dug him up and didn t find nothing what would she think of me 
blame it i says i might get hunted up and jailed i d better lay low and keep dark and not write at all the thing s awful mixed now trying to better it i ve worsened it a hundred times and i wish to goodness i d just let it alone dad fetch the whole business 
they buried him and we come back home and i went to watching faces again  i couldn t help it and i couldn t rest easy 
but nothing come of it the faces didn t tell me nothing 
the king he visited around in the evening and sweetened everybody up and made himself ever so friendly and he give out the idea that his congregation over in england would be in a sweat about him so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home 
he was very sorry he was so pushed and so was everybody they wished he could stay longer but they said they could see it couldn t be done 
and he said of course him and william would take the girls home with them and that pleased everybody too because then the girls would be well fixed and amongst their own relations and it pleased the girls too  tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to they would be ready 
them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so but i didn t see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune 
well blamed if the king didn t bill the house and the niggers and all the property for auction straight off  sale two days after the funeral but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to 
so the next day after the funeral along about noon time the girls joy got the first jolt 
a couple of nigger traders come along and the king sold them the niggers reasonable for three day drafts as they called it and away they went the two sons up the river to memphis and their mother down the river to orleans 
i thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief they cried around each other and took on so it most made me down sick to see it 
the girls said they hadn t ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town 
i can t ever get it out of my memory the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other s necks and crying and i reckon i couldn t a stood it all but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if i hadn t knowed the sale warn t no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two 
the thing made a big stir in the town too and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way 
it injured the frauds some but the old fool he bulled right along spite of all the duke could say or do and i tell you the duke was powerful uneasy 
next day was auction day 
about broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up and i see by their look that there was trouble 
the king says  was you in my room night before last  
 no your majesty   which was the way i always called him when nobody but our gang warn t around 
 was you in there yisterday er last night  
 no your majesty  
 honor bright now  no lies  
 honor bright your majesty i m telling you the truth 
i hain t been a near your room since miss mary jane took you and the duke and showed it to you  
the duke says  have you seen anybody else go in there  
 no your grace not as i remember i believe  
 stop and think  
i studied awhile and see my chance then i says  well i see the niggers go in there several times  
both of them gave a little jump and looked like they hadn t ever expected it and then like they  had 
then the duke says  what all of them  
 no  leastways not all at once  that is i don t think i ever see them all come  out  at once but just one time  
 hello 
when was that  
 it was the day we had the funeral 
in the morning 
it warn t early because i overslept 
i was just starting down the ladder and i see them  
 well go on  go  on 
what did they do 
how d they act  
 they didn t do nothing 
and they didn t act anyway much as fur as i see 
they tiptoed away so i seen easy enough that they d shoved in there to do up your majesty s room or something s posing you was up and found you  warn t  up and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up if they hadn t already waked you up  
 great guns  this  is a go  
says the king and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly 
they stood there a thinking and scratching their heads a minute and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle and says  it does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand 
they let on to be  sorry  they was going out of this region 
and i believed they was  sorry and so did you and so did everybody 
don t ever tell  me  any more that a nigger ain t got any histrionic talent 
why the way they played that thing it would fool  anybody 
in my opinion there s a fortune in em 
if i had capital and a theater i wouldn t want a better lay out than that  and here we ve gone and sold em for a song 
yes and ain t privileged to sing the song yet 
say where  is  that song  that draft  
 in the bank for to be collected 
where  would  it be  
 well  that s  all right then thank goodness  
says i kind of timid like  is something gone wrong  
the king whirls on me and rips out  none o your business 
you keep your head shet and mind y r own affairs  if you got any 
long as you re in this town don t you forgit that  you hear  
then he says to the duke we got to jest swaller it and say noth n  mum s the word for  us  
as they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again and says  quick sales  and  small profits 
it s a good business  yes  
the king snarls around on him and says  i was trying to do for the best in sellin em out so quick 
if the profits has turned out to be none lackin considable and none to carry is it my fault any more n it s yourn  
 well  they d  be in this house yet and we  wouldn t  if i could a got my advice listened to  
the king sassed back as much as was safe for him and then swapped around and lit into  me  again 
he give me down the banks for not coming and  telling  him i see the niggers come out of his room acting that way  said any fool would a  knowed  something was up 
and then waltzed in and cussed  himself  awhile and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning and he d be blamed if he d ever do it again 
so they went off a jawing and i felt dreadful glad i d worked it all off on to the niggers and yet hadn t done the niggers no harm by it 
chapter xxviii 
by and by it was getting up time 
so i come down the ladder and started for down stairs but as i come to the girls room the door was open and i see mary jane setting by her old hair trunk which was open and she d been packing things in it  getting ready to go to england 
but she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap and had her face in her hands crying 
i felt awful bad to see it of course anybody would 
i went in there and says  miss mary jane you can t a bear to see people in trouble and i can t  most always 
tell me about it  
so she done it 
and it was the niggers  i just expected it 
she said the beautiful trip to england was most about spoiled for her she didn t know  how  she was ever going to be happy there knowing the mother and the children warn t ever going to see each other no more  and then busted out bitterer than ever and flung up her hands and says  oh dear dear to think they ain t  ever  going to see each other any more  
 but they  will  and inside of two weeks  and i  know  it  
says i 
laws it was out before i could think 
and before i could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it  again  say it again  say it  again 
i see i had spoke too sudden and said too much and was in a close place 
i asked her to let me think a minute and she set there very impatient and excited and handsome but looking kind of happy and eased up like a person that s had a tooth pulled out 
so i went to studying it out 
i says to myself i reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks though i ain t had no experience and can t say for certain but it looks so to me anyway and yet here s a case where i m blest if it don t look to me like the truth is better and actuly  safer  than a lie 
i must lay it by in my mind and think it over some time or other it s so kind of strange and unregular 
i never see nothing like it 
well i says to myself at last i m a going to chance it i ll up and tell the truth this time though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you ll go to 
then i says  miss mary jane is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days  
 yes mr lothrop s 
why  
 never mind why yet 
if i ll tell you how i know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weeks  here in this house  and  prove  how i know it  will you go to mr lothrop s and stay four days  
 four days  
she says i ll stay a year  
 all right  i says i don t want nothing more out of  you  than just your word  i druther have it than another man s kiss the bible  
she smiled and reddened up very sweet and i says if you don t mind it i ll shut the door  and bolt it  
then i come back and set down again and says  don t you holler 
just set still and take it like a man 
i got to tell the truth and you want to brace up miss mary because it s a bad kind and going to be hard to take but there ain t no help for it 
these uncles of yourn ain t no uncles at all they re a couple of frauds  regular dead beats 
there now we re over the worst of it you can stand the rest middling easy  
it jolted her up like everything of course but i was over the shoal water now so i went right along her eyes a blazing higher and higher all the time and told her every blame thing from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat clear through to where she flung herself on to the king s breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times  and then up she jumps with her face afire like sunset and says  the brute 
come don t waste a minute  not a  second  we ll have them tarred and feathered and flung in the river  
says i  cert nly 
but do you mean  before  you go to mr lothrop s or    oh  she says what am i  thinking  about  
she says and set right down again 
 don t mind what i said  please don t  you  won t  now will  you  
laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that i said i would die first 
 i never thought i was so stirred up  she says now go on and i won t do so any more 
you tell me what to do and whatever you say i ll do it  
 well  i says it s a rough gang them two frauds and i m fixed so i got to travel with them a while longer whether i want to or not  i druther not tell you why and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws and i d be all right but there d be another person that you don t know about who d be in big trouble 
well we got to save  him  hain t we 
of course 
well then we won t blow on them  
saying them words put a good idea in my head 
i see how maybe i could get me and jim rid of the frauds get them jailed here and then leave 
but i didn t want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me so i didn t want the plan to begin working till pretty late to night 
i says  miss mary jane i ll tell you what we ll do and you won t have to stay at mr lothrop s so long nuther 
how fur is it  
 a little short of four miles  right out in the country back here  
 well that ll answer 
now you go along out there and lay low till nine or half past to night and then get them to fetch you home again  tell them you ve thought of something 
if you get here before eleven put a candle in this window and if i don t turn up wait  till  eleven and  then  if i don t turn up it means i m gone and out of the way and safe 
then you come out and spread the news around and get these beats jailed  
 good  she says i ll do it  
 and if it just happens so that i don t get away but get took up along with them you must up and say i told you the whole thing beforehand and you must stand by me all you can  
 stand by you 
indeed i will 
they sha n t touch a hair of your head  
she says and i see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it too 
 if i get away i sha n t be here  i says to prove these rapscallions ain t your uncles and i couldn t do it if i  was  here 
i could swear they was beats and bummers that s all though that s worth something 
well there s others can do that better than what i can and they re people that ain t going to be doubted as quick as i d be 
i ll tell you how to find them 
gimme a pencil and a piece of paper 
there   royal nonesuch bricksville  
put it away and don t lose it 
when the court wants to find out something about these two let them send up to bricksville and say they ve got the men that played the royal nonesuch and ask for some witnesses  why you ll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink miss mary 
and they ll come a biling too  
i judged we had got everything fixed about right now 
so i says  just let the auction go right along and don t worry 
nobody don t have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice and they ain t going out of this till they get that money and the way we ve fixed it the sale ain t going to count and they ain t going to get no money 
it s just like the way it was with the niggers  it warn t no sale and the niggers will be back before long 
why they can t collect the money for the  niggers  yet  they re in the worst kind of a fix miss mary  
 well  she says i ll run down to breakfast now and then i ll start straight for mr 
lothrop s  
  deed  that  ain t the ticket miss mary jane  i says by no manner of means go  before  breakfast  
 why  
 what did you reckon i wanted you to go at all for miss mary  
 well i never thought  and come to think i don t know 
what was it  
 why it s because you ain t one of these leather face people 
i don t want no better book than what your face is 
a body can set down and read it off like coarse print 
do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you good morning and never    there there don t 
yes i ll go before breakfast  i ll be glad to 
and leave my sisters with them  
 yes never mind about them 
they ve got to stand it yet a while 
they might suspicion something if all of you was to go 
i don t want you to see them nor your sisters nor nobody in this town if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something 
no you go right along miss mary jane and i ll fix it with all of them 
i ll tell miss susan to give your love to your uncles and say you ve went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change or to see a friend and you ll be back to night or early in the morning  
 gone to see a friend is all right but i won t have my love given to them  
 well then it sha n t be  
it was well enough to tell  her  so  no harm in it 
it was only a little thing to do and no trouble and it s the little things that smooths people s roads the most down here below it would make mary jane comfortable and it wouldn t cost nothing 
then i says  there s one more thing  that bag of money  
 well they ve got that and it makes me feel pretty silly to think how  they got it  
 no you re out there 
they hain t got it  
 why who s got it  
 i wish i knowed but i don t 
i  had  it because i stole it from them and i stole it to give to you and i know where i hid it but i m afraid it ain t there no more 
i m awful sorry miss mary jane i m just as sorry as i can be but i done the best i could i did honest 
i come nigh getting caught and i had to shove it into the first place i come to and run  and it warn t a good place  
 oh stop blaming yourself  it s too bad to do it and i won t allow it  you couldn t help it it wasn t your fault 
where did you hide it  
i didn t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again and i couldn t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach 
so for a minute i didn t say nothing then i says  i d ruther not  tell  you where i put it miss mary jane if you don t mind letting me off but i ll write it for you on a piece of paper and you can read it along the road to mr lothrop s if you want to 
do you reckon that ll do  
 oh yes  
so i wrote  i put it in the coffin 
it was in there when you was crying there away in the night 
i was behind the door and i was mighty sorry for you miss mary jane  
it made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night and them devils laying there right under her own roof shaming her and robbing her and when i folded it up and give it to her i see the water come into her eyes too and she shook me by the hand hard and says   good bye 
i m going to do everything just as you ve told me and if i don t ever see you again i sha n t ever forget you and i ll think of you a many and a many a time and i ll  pray  for you too  
  and she was gone 
pray for me 
i reckoned if she knowed me she d take a job that was more nearer her size 
but i bet she done it just the same  she was just that kind 
she had the grit to pray for judus if she took the notion  there warn t no back down to her i judge 
you may say what you want to but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl i ever see in my opinion she was just full of sand 
it sounds like flattery but it ain t no flattery 
and when it comes to beauty  and goodness too  she lays over them all 
i hain t ever seen her since that time that i see her go out of that door no i hain t ever seen her since but i reckon i ve thought of her a many and a many a million times and of her saying she would pray for me and if ever i d a thought it would do any good for me to pray for  her  blamed if i wouldn t a done it or bust 
well mary jane she lit out the back way i reckon because nobody see her go 
when i struck susan and the hare lip i says  what s the name of them people over on t other side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes  
they says  there s several but it s the proctors mainly  
 that s the name  i says i most forgot it 
well miss mary jane she told me to tell you she s gone over there in a dreadful hurry  one of them s sick  
 which one  
 i don t know leastways i kinder forget but i thinks it s    sakes alive i hope it ain t  hanner  
 i m sorry to say it  i says but hanner s the very one  
 my goodness and she so well only last week 
is she took bad  
 it ain t no name for it 
they set up with her all night miss mary jane said and they don t think she ll last many hours  
 only think of that now 
what s the matter with her  
i couldn t think of anything reasonable right off that way so i says  mumps  
 mumps your granny 
they don t set up with people that s got the mumps  
 they don t don t they 
you better bet they do with  these  mumps 
these mumps is different 
it s a new kind miss mary jane said  
 how s it a new kind  
 because it s mixed up with other things  
 what other things  
 well measles and whooping cough and erysiplas and consumption and yaller janders and brain fever and i don t know what all  
 my land 
and they call it the  mumps  
 that s what miss mary jane said  
 well what in the nation do they call it the  mumps  for  
 why because it  is  the mumps 
that s what it starts with  
 well ther ain t no sense in it 
a body might stump his toe and take pison and fall down the well and break his neck and bust his brains out and somebody come along and ask what killed him and some numskull up and say why he stumped his  toe  
would ther be any sense in that 
no 
and ther ain t no sense in  this  nuther 
is it ketching  
 is it  ketching 
why how you talk 
is a  harrow  catching  in the dark 
if you don t hitch on to one tooth you re bound to on another ain t you 
and you can t get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along can you 
well these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow as you may say  and it ain t no slouch of a harrow nuther you come to get it hitched on good  
 well it s awful i think  says the hare lip 
 i ll go to uncle harvey and    oh yes  i says i  would 
of  course  i would 
i wouldn t lose no time  
 well why wouldn t you  
 just look at it a minute and maybe you can see 
hain t your uncles obleegd to get along home to england as fast as they can 
and do you reckon they d be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves 
you  know they ll wait for you 
so fur so good 
your uncle harvey s a preacher ain t he 
very well then is a preacher  going to deceive a steamboat clerk 
is he going to deceive a  ship clerk 
  so as to get them to let miss mary jane go aboard 
now you  know he ain t 
what  will  he do then 
why he ll say it s a great pity but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus unum mumps and so it s my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she s got it  
but never mind if you think it s best to tell your uncle harvey    shucks and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in england whilst we was waiting to find out whether mary jane s got it or not 
why you talk like a muggins  
 well anyway maybe you d better tell some of the neighbors  
 listen at that now 
you do beat all for natural stupidness 
can t you  see  that  they d  go and tell 
ther ain t no way but just to not tell anybody at  all  
 well maybe you re right  yes i judge you  are  right  
 but i reckon we ought to tell uncle harvey she s gone out a while anyway so he won t be uneasy about her  
 yes miss mary jane she wanted you to do that 
she says tell them to give uncle harvey and william my love and a kiss and say i ve run over the river to see mr    mr   what  is  the name of that rich family your uncle peter used to think so much of   i mean the one that    why you must mean the apthorps ain t it  
 of course bother them kind of names a body can t ever seem to remember them half the time somehow 
yes she said say she has run over for to ask the apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house because she allowed her uncle peter would ruther they had it than anybody else and she s going to stick to them till they say they ll come and then if she ain t too tired she s coming home and if she is she ll be home in the morning anyway 
she said don t say nothing about the proctors but only about the apthorps  which ll be perfectly true because she is going there to speak about their buying the house i know it because she told me so herself  
 all right  they said and cleared out to lay for their uncles and give them the love and the kisses and tell them the message 
everything was all right now 
the girls wouldn t say nothing because they wanted to go to england and the king and the duke would ruther mary jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of doctor robinson 
i felt very good i judged i had done it pretty neat  i reckoned tom sawyer couldn t a done it no neater himself 
of course he would a throwed more style into it but i can t do that very handy not being brung up to it 
well they held the auction in the public square along towards the end of the afternoon and it strung along and strung along and the old man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest up there longside of the auctioneer and chipping in a little scripture now and then or a little goody goody saying of some kind and the duke he was around goo gooing for sympathy all he knowed how and just spreading himself generly 
but by and by the thing dragged through and everything was sold  everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard 
so they d got to work that off  i never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow  everything 
well whilst they was at it a steamboat landed and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a whooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on and singing out   here s  your opposition line 
here s your two sets o heirs to old peter wilks  and you pays your money and you takes your choice  
chapter xxix 
they was fetching a very nice looking old gentleman along and a nice looking younger one with his right arm in a sling 
and my souls how the people yelled and laughed and kept it up 
but i didn t see no joke about it and i judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any 
i reckoned they d turn pale 
but no nary a pale did they  turn 
the duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up but just went a goo gooing around happy and satisfied like a jug that s googling out buttermilk and as for the king he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new comers like it give him the stomach ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world 
oh he done it admirable 
lots of the principal people gethered around the king to let him see they was on his side 
that old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death 
pretty soon he begun to speak and i see straight off he pronounced  like  an englishman  not the king s way though the king s  was  pretty good for an imitation 
i can t give the old gent s words nor i can t imitate him but he turned around to the crowd and says about like this  this is a surprise to me which i wasn t looking for and i ll acknowledge candid and frank i ain t very well fixed to meet it and answer it for my brother and me has had misfortunes he s broke his arm and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake 
i am peter wilks brother harvey and this is his brother william which can t hear nor speak  and can t even make signs to amount to much now t he s only got one hand to work them with 
we are who we say we are and in a day or two when i get the baggage i can prove it 
but up till then i won t say nothing more but go to the hotel and wait  
so him and the new dummy started off and the king he laughs and blethers out  broke his arm  very  likely  ain t  it   and very convenient too for a fraud that s got to make signs and ain t learnt how 
lost their baggage 
that s  mighty  good   and mighty ingenious  under the circumstances  
so he laughed again and so did everybody else except three or four or maybe half a dozen 
one of these was that doctor another one was a sharp looking gentleman with a carpet bag of the old fashioned kind made out of carpet stuff that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their heads  it was levi bell the lawyer that was gone up to louisville and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said and was listening to the king now 
and when the king got done this husky up and says  say looky here if you are harvey wilks when d you come to this town  
 the day before the funeral friend  says the king 
 but what time o day  
 in the evenin    bout an hour er two before sundown  
 how d  you come  
 i come down on the susan powell from cincinnati  
 well then how d you come to be up at the pint in the  mornin   in a canoe  
 i warn t up at the pint in the mornin   
 it s a lie  
several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher 
 preacher be hanged he s a fraud and a liar 
he was up at the pint that mornin  
i live up there don t i 
well i was up there and he was up there 
i see him there 
he come in a canoe along with tim collins and a boy  
the doctor he up and says  would you know the boy again if you was to see him hines  
 i reckon i would but i don t know 
why yonder he is now 
i know him perfectly easy  
it was me he pointed at 
the doctor says  neighbors i don t know whether the new couple is frauds or not but if these  two ain t frauds i am an idiot that s all 
i think it s our duty to see that they don t get away from here till we ve looked into this thing 
come along hines come along the rest of you 
we ll take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t other couple and i reckon we ll find out  something  before we get through  
it was nuts for the crowd though maybe not for the king s friends so we all started 
it was about sundown 
the doctor he led me along by the hand and was plenty kind enough but he never let go my hand 
we all got in a big room in the hotel and lit up some candles and fetched in the new couple 
first the doctor says  i don t wish to be too hard on these two men but i think they re frauds and they may have complices that we don t know nothing about 
if they have won t the complices get away with that bag of gold peter wilks left 
it ain t unlikely 
if these men ain t frauds they won t object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they re all right  ain t that so  
everybody agreed to that 
so i judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart 
but the king he only looked sorrowful and says  gentlemen i wish the money was there for i ain t got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair open out and out investigation o this misable business but alas the money ain t there you k n send and see if you want to  
 where is it then  
 well when my niece give it to me to keep for her i took and hid it inside o the straw tick o my bed not wishin to bank it for the few days we d be here and considerin the bed a safe place we not bein used to niggers and suppos n em honest like servants in england 
the niggers stole it the very next mornin after i had went down stairs and when i sold em i hadn t missed the money yit so they got clean away with it 
my servant here k n tell you bout it gentlemen  
the doctor and several said shucks  
and i see nobody didn t altogether believe him 
one man asked me if i see the niggers steal it 
i said no but i see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away and i never thought nothing only i reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them 
that was all they asked me 
then the doctor whirls on me and says  are  you  english too  
i says yes and him and some others laughed and said stuff  
well then they sailed in on the general investigation and there we had it up and down hour in hour out and nobody never said a word about supper nor ever seemed to think about it  and so they kept it up and kept it up and it  was  the worst mixed up thing you ever see 
they made the king tell his yarn and they made the old gentleman tell his n and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a  seen  that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t other one lies 
and by and by they had me up to tell what i knowed 
the king he give me a left handed look out of the corner of his eye and so i knowed enough to talk on the right side 
i begun to tell about sheffield and how we lived there and all about the english wilkses and so on but i didn t get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh and levi bell the lawyer says  set down my boy i wouldn t strain myself if i was you 
i reckon you ain t used to lying it don t seem to come handy what you want is practice 
you do it pretty awkward  
i didn t care nothing for the compliment but i was glad to be let off anyway 
the doctor he started to say something and turns and says  if you d been in town at first levi bell   the king broke in and reached out his hand and says  why is this my poor dead brother s old friend that he s wrote so often about  
the lawyer and him shook hands and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased and they talked right along awhile and then got to one side and talked low and at last the lawyer speaks up and says  that ll fix it 
i ll take the order and send it along with your brother s and then they ll know it s all right  
so they got some paper and a pen and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side and chawed his tongue and scrawled off something and then they give the pen to the duke  and then for the first time the duke looked sick 
but he took the pen and wrote 
so then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says  you and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names  
the old gentleman wrote but nobody couldn t read it 
the lawyer looked powerful astonished and says  well it beats  me   and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket and examined them and then examined the old man s writing and then them  again and then says  these old letters is from harvey wilks and here s  these  two handwritings and anybody can see they didn t write them the king and the duke looked sold and foolish i tell you to see how the lawyer had took them in  and here s  this  old gentleman s hand writing and anybody can tell easy enough  he  didn t write them  fact is the scratches he makes ain t properly  writing  at all 
now here s some letters from    the new old gentleman says  if you please let me explain 
nobody can read my hand but my brother there  so he copies for me 
it s  his  hand you ve got there not mine  
 well  
says the lawyer this  is  a state of things 
i ve got some of william s letters too so if you ll get him to write a line or so we can com    he  can t  write with his left hand  says the old gentleman 
 if he could use his right hand you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too 
look at both please  they re by the same hand  
the lawyer done it and says  i believe it s so  and if it ain t so there s a heap stronger resemblance than i d noticed before anyway 
well well well 
i thought we was right on the track of a solution but it s gone to grass partly 
but anyway one thing is proved  these  two ain t either of em wilkses   and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke 
well what do you think 
that muleheaded old fool wouldn t give in then 
indeed he wouldn t 
said it warn t no fair test 
said his brother william was the cussedest joker in the world and hadn t tried to write  he  see william was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper 
and so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying  himself  but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in and says  i ve thought of something 
is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br  helped to lay out the late peter wilks for burying  
 yes  says somebody me and ab turner done it 
we re both here  
then the old man turns towards the king and says  perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast  
blamed if the king didn t have to brace up mighty quick or he d a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under it took him so sudden and mind you it was a thing that was calculated to make most  anybody  sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice because how was  he  going to know what was tattooed on the man 
he whitened a little he couldn t help it and it was mighty still in there and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him 
says i to myself  now  he ll throw up the sponge  there ain t no more use 
well did he 
a body can t hardly believe it but he didn t 
i reckon he thought he d keep the thing up till he tired them people out so they d thin out and him and the duke could break loose and get away 
anyway he set there and pretty soon he begun to smile and says  mf 
it s a  very  tough question  ain t  it 
yes  sir i k n tell you what s tattooed on his breast 
it s jest a small thin blue arrow  that s what it is and if you don t look clost you can t see it 
now  what do you say  hey  
well i never see anything like that old blister for clean out and out cheek 
the new old gentleman turns brisk towards ab turner and his pard and his eye lights up like he judged he d got the king  this  time and says  there  you ve heard what he said 
was there any such mark on peter wilks breast  
both of them spoke up and says  we didn t see no such mark  
 good  
says the old gentleman 
 now what you  did  see on his breast was a small dim p and a b which is an initial he dropped when he was young  and a w with dashes between them so p  b  w   and he marked them that way on a piece of paper 
 come ain t that what you saw  
both of them spoke up again and says  no we  didn t 
we never seen any marks at all  
well everybody  was  in a state of mind now and they sings out  the whole  bilin  of m s frauds 
le s duck em 
le s drown em 
le s ride em on a rail  
and everybody was whooping at once and there was a rattling powwow 
but the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells and says  gentlemen  gentle men 
hear me just a word  just a  single  word  if you please 
there s one way yet  let s go and dig up the corpse and look  
that took them 
 hooray  
they all shouted and was starting right off but the lawyer and the doctor sung out  hold on hold on 
collar all these four men and the boy and fetch them  along too  
 we ll do it  
they all shouted and if we don t find them marks we ll lynch the whole gang  
i  was  scared now i tell you 
but there warn t no getting away you know 
they gripped us all and marched us right along straight for the graveyard which was a mile and a half down the river and the whole town at our heels for we made noise enough and it was only nine in the evening 
as we went by our house i wished i hadn t sent mary jane out of town because now if i could tip her the wink she d light out and save me and blow on our dead beats 
well we swarmed along down the river road just carrying on like wildcats and to make it more scary the sky was darking up and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves 
this was the most awful trouble and most dangersome i ever was in and i was kinder stunned everything was going so different from what i had allowed for stead of being fixed so i could take my own time if i wanted to and see all the fun and have mary jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close fit come here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo marks 
if they didn t find them   i couldn t bear to think about it and yet somehow i couldn t think about nothing else 
it got darker and darker and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip but that big husky had me by the wrist  hines  and a body might as well try to give goliar the slip 
he dragged me right along he was so excited and i had to run to keep up 
when they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow 
and when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted but nobody hadn t thought to fetch a lantern 
but they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning and sent a man to the nearest house a half a mile off to borrow one 
so they dug and dug like everything and it got awful dark and the rain started and the wind swished and swushed along and the lightning come brisker and brisker and the thunder boomed but them people never took no notice of it they was so full of this business and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave and the next second the dark wiped it all out and you couldn t see nothing at all 
at last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was to scrouge in and get a sight you never see and in the dark that way it was awful 
hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so and i reckon he clean forgot i was in the world he was so excited and panting 
all of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare and somebody sings out  by the living jingo here s the bag of gold on his breast  
hines let out a whoop like everybody else and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look and the way i lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain t nobody can tell 
i had the road all to myself and i fairly flew  leastways i had it all to myself except the solid dark and the now and then glares and the buzzing of the rain and the thrashing of the wind and the splitting of the thunder and sure as you are born i did clip it along 
when i struck the town i see there warn t nobody out in the storm so i never hunted for no back streets but humped it straight through the main one and when i begun to get towards our house i aimed my eye and set it 
no light there the house all dark  which made me feel sorry and disappointed i didn t know why 
but at last just as i was sailing by flash  comes the light in mary jane s window 
and my heart swelled up sudden like to bust and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark and wasn t ever going to be before me no more in this world 
she  was  the best girl i ever see and had the most sand 
the minute i was far enough above the town to see i could make the towhead i begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow and the first time the lightning showed me one that wasn t chained i snatched it and shoved 
it was a canoe and warn t fastened with nothing but a rope 
the towhead was a rattling big distance off away out there in the middle of the river but i didn t lose no time and when i struck the raft at last i was so fagged i would a just laid down to blow and gasp if i could afforded it 
but i didn t 
as i sprung aboard i sung out  out with you jim and set her loose 
glory be to goodness we re shut of them  
jim lit out and was a coming for me with both arms spread he was so full of joy but when i glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and i went overboard backwards for i forgot he was old king lear and a drownded a rab all in one and it most scared the livers and lights out of me 
but jim fished me out and was going to hug me and bless me and so on he was so glad i was back and we was shut of the king and the duke but i says  not now have it for breakfast have it for breakfast 
cut loose and let her slide  
so in two seconds away we went a sliding down the river and it  did  seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river and nobody to bother us 
i had to skip around a bit and jump up and crack my heels a few times  i couldn t help it but about the third crack i noticed a sound that i knowed mighty well and held my breath and listened and waited and sure enough when the next flash busted out over the water here they come   and just a laying to their oars and making their skiff hum 
it was the king and the duke 
so i wilted right down on to the planks then and give up and it was all i could do to keep from crying 
chapter xxx 
when they got aboard the king went for me and shook me by the collar and says  tryin to give us the slip was ye you pup 
tired of our company hey  
i says  no your majesty we warn t  please  don t your majesty  
 quick then and tell us what  was  your idea or i ll shake the insides out o you  
 honest i ll tell you everything just as it happened your majesty 
the man that had a holt of me was very good to me and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold and made a rush for the coffin he lets go of me and whispers heel it now or they ll hang ye sure  
and i lit out 
it didn t seem no good for  me  to stay  i couldn t do nothing and i didn t want to be hung if i could get away 
so i never stopped running till i found the canoe and when i got here i told jim to hurry or they d catch me and hang me yet and said i was afeard you and the duke wasn t alive now and i was awful sorry and so was jim and was awful glad when we see you coming you may ask jim if i didn t  
jim said it was so and the king told him to shut up and said oh yes it s  mighty  likely  
and shook me up again and said he reckoned he d drownd me 
but the duke says  leggo the boy you old idiot 
would  you  a done any different 
did you inquire around for  him  when you got loose 
i don t remember it  
so the king let go of me and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it 
but the duke says  you better a blame sight give  yourself  a good cussing for you re the one that s entitled to it most 
you hain t done a thing from the start that had any sense in it except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue arrow mark 
that  was  bright  it was right down bully and it was the thing that saved us 
for if it hadn t been for that they d a jailed us till them englishmen s baggage come  and then  the penitentiary you bet 
but that trick took em to the graveyard and the gold done us a still bigger kindness for if the excited fools hadn t let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we d a slept in our cravats to night  cravats warranted to  wear  too  longer than  we d  need em  
they was still a minute  thinking then the king says kind of absent minded like  mf 
and we reckoned the  niggers  stole it  
that made me squirm 
 yes  says the duke kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic  we  did  
after about a half a minute the king drawls out  leastways i did  
the duke says the same way  on the contrary i did  
the king kind of ruffles up and says  looky here bilgewater what r you referrin to  
the duke says pretty brisk  when it comes to that maybe you ll let me ask what was  you  referring to  
 shucks  
says the king very sarcastic but i don t know  maybe you was asleep and didn t know what you was about  
the duke bristles up now and says  oh let  up  on this cussed nonsense do you take me for a blame fool 
don t you reckon i know who hid that money in that coffin  
 yes  sir 
i know you  do  know because you done it yourself  
 it s a lie  
  and the duke went for him 
the king sings out  take y r hands off   leggo my throat   i take it all back  
the duke says  well you just own up first that you  did  hide that money there intending to give me the slip one of these days and come back and dig it up and have it all to yourself  
 wait jest a minute duke  answer me this one question honest and fair if you didn t put the money there say it and i ll b lieve you and take back everything i said  
 you old scoundrel i didn t and you know i didn t 
there now  
 well then i b lieve you 
but answer me only jest this one more  now don t  git mad didn t you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it  
the duke never said nothing for a little bit then he says  well i don t care if i  did  i didn t  do  it anyway 
but you not only had it in mind to do it but you  done  it  
 i wisht i never die if i done it duke and that s honest 
i won t say i warn t goin to do it because i  was  but you  i mean somebody  got in ahead o me  
 it s a lie 
you done it and you got to  say  you done it or    the king began to gurgle and then he gasps out   nough   i  own up 
i was very glad to hear him say that it made me feel much more easier than what i was feeling before 
so the duke took his hands off and says  if you ever deny it again i ll drown you 
it s  well  for you to set there and blubber like a baby  it s fitten for you after the way you ve acted 
i never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything  and i a trusting you all the time like you was my own father 
you ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers and you never say a word for em 
it makes me feel ridiculous to think i was soft enough to  believe  that rubbage 
cuss you i can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit  you wanted to get what money i d got out of the nonesuch and one thing or another and scoop it  all  
the king says timid and still a snuffling  why duke it was you that said make up the deffisit it warn t me  
 dry up 
i don t want to hear no more out of you  
says the duke 
 and now  you see what you got by it 
they ve got all their own money back and all of  ourn  but a shekel or two  besides 
g long to bed and don t you deffersit  me  no more deffersits long s  you  live  
so the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort and before long the duke tackled his bottle and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again and the tighter they got the lovinger they got and went off a snoring in each other s arms 
they both got powerful mellow but i noticed the king didn t get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money bag again 
that made me feel easy and satisfied 
of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble and i told jim everything 
chapter xxxi 
we dasn t stop again at any town for days and days kept right along down the river 
we was down south in the warm weather now and a mighty long ways from home 
we begun to come to trees with spanish moss on them hanging down from the limbs like long gray beards 
it was the first i ever see it growing and it made the woods look solemn and dismal 
so now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger and they begun to work the villages again 
first they done a lecture on temperance but they didn t make enough for them both to get drunk on 
then in another village they started a dancing school but they didn t know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town 
another time they tried to go at yellocution but they didn t yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing and made them skip out 
they tackled missionarying and mesmerizing and doctoring and telling fortunes and a little of everything but they couldn t seem to have no luck 
so at last they got just about dead broke and laid around the raft as she floated along thinking and thinking and never saying nothing by the half a day at a time and dreadful blue and desperate 
and at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time 
jim and me got uneasy 
we didn t like the look of it 
we judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever 
we turned it over and over and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebody s house or store or was going into the counterfeit money business or something 
so then we was pretty scared and made up an agreement that we wouldn t have nothing in the world to do with such actions and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind 
well early one morning we hid the raft in a good safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named pikesville and the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the royal nonesuch there yet 
  house to rob you  mean  says i to myself and when you get through robbing it you ll come back here and wonder what has become of me and jim and the raft  and you ll have to take it out in wondering   
and he said if he warn t back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right and we was to come along 
so we stayed where we was 
the duke he fretted and sweated around and was in a mighty sour way 
he scolded us for everything and we couldn t seem to do nothing right he found fault with every little thing 
something was a brewing sure 
i was good and glad when midday come and no king we could have a change anyway  and maybe a chance for  the  change on top of it 
so me and the duke went up to the village and hunted around there for the king and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery very tight and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport and he a cussing and a threatening with all his might and so tight he couldn t walk and couldn t do nothing to them 
the duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool and the king begun to sass back and the minute they was fairly at it i lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs and spun down the river road like a deer for i see our chance and i made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and jim again 
i got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy and sung out  set her loose jim 
we re all right now  
but there warn t no answer and nobody come out of the wigwam 
jim was gone 
i set up a shout  and then another  and then another one and run this way and that in the woods whooping and screeching but it warn t no use  old jim was gone 
then i set down and cried i couldn t help it 
but i couldn t set still long 
pretty soon i went out on the road trying to think what i better do and i run across a boy walking and asked him if he d seen a strange nigger dressed so and so and he says  yes  
 whereabouts  
says i 
 down to silas phelps place two mile below here 
he s a runaway nigger and they ve got him 
was you looking for him  
 you bet i ain t 
i run across him in the woods about an hour or two ago and he said if i hollered he d cut my livers out  and told me to lay down and stay where i was and i done it 
been there ever since afeard to come out  
 well  he says you needn t be afeard no more becuz they ve got him 
he run off f m down south som ers  
 it s a good job they got him  
 well i  reckon 
there s two hunderd dollars reward on him 
it s like picking up money out n the road  
 yes it is  and i could a had it if i d been big enough i see him first 
who nailed him  
 it was an old fellow  a stranger  and he sold out his chance in him for forty dollars becuz he s got to go up the river and can t wait 
think o that now 
you bet  i d  wait if it was seven year  
 that s me every time  says i 
 but maybe his chance ain t worth no more than that if he ll sell it so cheap 
maybe there s something ain t straight about it  
 but it  is  though  straight as a string 
i see the handbill myself 
it tells all about him to a dot  paints him like a picture and tells the plantation he s frum below newr leans 
no sirree bob  they ain t no trouble bout  that  speculation you bet you 
say gimme a chaw tobacker won t ye  
i didn t have none so he left 
i went to the raft and set down in the wigwam to think 
but i couldn t come to nothing 
i thought till i wore my head sore but i couldn t see no way out of the trouble 
after all this long journey and after all we d done for them scoundrels here it was all come to nothing everything all busted up and ruined because they could have the heart to serve jim such a trick as that and make him a slave again all his life and amongst strangers too for forty dirty dollars 
once i said to myself it would be a thousand times better for jim to be a slave at home where his family was as long as he d  got  to be a slave and so i d better write a letter to tom sawyer and tell him to tell miss watson where he was 
but i soon give up that notion for two things she d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her and so she d sell him straight down the river again and if she didn t everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger and they d make jim feel it all the time and so he d feel ornery and disgraced 
and then think of  me 
it would get all around that huck finn helped a nigger to get his freedom and if i was ever to see anybody from that town again i d be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame 
that s just the way a person does a low down thing and then he don t want to take no consequences of it 
thinks as long as he can hide it it ain t no disgrace 
that was my fix exactly 
the more i studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me and the more wicked and low down and ornery i got to feeling 
and at last when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven whilst i was stealing a poor old woman s nigger that hadn t ever done me no harm and now was showing me there s one that s always on the lookout and ain t a going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further i most dropped in my tracks i was so scared 
well i tried the best i could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying i was brung up wicked and so i warn t so much to blame but something inside of me kept saying there was the sunday school you could a gone to it and if you d a done it they d a learnt you there that people that acts as i d been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire  
it made me shiver 
and i about made up my mind to pray and see if i couldn t try to quit being the kind of a boy i was and be better 
so i kneeled down 
but the words wouldn t come 
why wouldn t they 
it warn t no use to try and hide it from him 
nor from  me  neither 
i knowed very well why they wouldn t come 
it was because my heart warn t right it was because i warn t square it was because i was playing double 
i was letting  on  to give up sin but away inside of me i was holding on to the biggest one of all 
i was trying to make my mouth say  i would do the right thing and the clean thing and go and write to that nigger s owner and tell where he was but deep down in me i knowed it was a lie and he knowed it 
you can t pray a lie  i found that out 
so i was full of trouble full as i could be and didn t know what to do 
at last i had an idea and i says i ll go and write the letter  and then see if i can pray 
why it was astonishing the way i felt as light as a feather right straight off and my troubles all gone 
so i got a piece of paper and a pencil all glad and excited and set down and wrote  miss watson your runaway nigger jim is down here two mile below pikesville and mr phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send 
huck finn 
i felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time i had ever felt so in my life and i knowed i could pray now 
but i didn t do it straight off but laid the paper down and set there thinking  thinking how good it was all this happened so and how near i come to being lost and going to hell 
and went on thinking 
and got to thinking over our trip down the river and i see jim before me all the time in the day and in the night time sometimes moonlight sometimes storms and we a floating along talking and singing and laughing 
but somehow i couldn t seem to strike no places to harden me against him but only the other kind 
i d see him standing my watch on top of his n stead of calling me so i could go on sleeping and see him how glad he was when i come back out of the fog and when i come to him again in the swamp up there where the feud was and such like times and would always call me honey and pet me and do everything he could think of for me and how good he always was and at last i struck the time i saved him by telling the men we had small pox aboard and he was so grateful and said i was the best friend old jim ever had in the world and the  only  one he s got now and then i happened to look around and see that paper 
it was a close place 
i took it up and held it in my hand 
i was a trembling because i d got to decide forever betwixt two things and i knowed it 
i studied a minute sort of holding my breath and then says to myself  all right then i ll  go  to hell   and tore it up 
it was awful thoughts and awful words but they was said 
and i let them stay said and never thought no more about reforming 
i shoved the whole thing out of my head and said i would take up wickedness again which was in my line being brung up to it and the other warn t 
and for a starter i would go to work and steal jim out of slavery again and if i could think up anything worse i would do that too because as long as i was in and in for good i might as well go the whole hog 
then i set to thinking over how to get at it and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind and at last fixed up a plan that suited me 
so then i took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece and as soon as it was fairly dark i crept out with my raft and went for it and hid it there and then turned in 
i slept the night through and got up before it was light and had my breakfast and put on my store clothes and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle and took the canoe and cleared for shore 
i landed below where i judged was phelps s place and hid my bundle in the woods and then filled up the canoe with water and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where i could find her again when i wanted her about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank 
then i struck up the road and when i passed the mill i see a sign on it phelps s sawmill  and when i come to the farm houses two or three hundred yards further along i kept my eyes peeled but didn t see nobody around though it was good daylight now 
but i didn t mind because i didn t want to see nobody just yet  i only wanted to get the lay of the land 
according to my plan i was going to turn up there from the village not from below 
so i just took a look and shoved along straight for town 
well the very first man i see when i got there was the duke 
he was sticking up a bill for the royal nonesuch  three night performance  like that other time 
they had the cheek them frauds 
i was right on him before i could shirk 
he looked astonished and says  hel lo 
where d  you  come from  
then he says kind of glad and eager where s the raft   got her in a good place  
i says  why that s just what i was going to ask your grace  
then he didn t look so joyful and says  what was your idea for asking  me  
he says 
 well  i says when i see the king in that doggery yesterday i says to myself we can t get him home for hours till he s soberer so i went a loafing around town to put in the time and wait 
a man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep and so i went along but when we was dragging him to the boat and the man left me a holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run and we after him 
we didn t have no dog and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out 
we never got him till dark then we fetched him over and i started down for the raft 
when i got there and see it was gone i says to myself they ve got into trouble and had to leave and they ve took my nigger which is the only nigger i ve got in the world and now i m in a strange country and ain t got no property no more nor nothing and no way to make my living  so i set down and cried 
i slept in the woods all night 
but what  did  become of the raft then   and jim  poor jim  
 blamed if i know  that is what s become of the raft 
that old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half dollars with him and got every cent but what he d spent for whisky and when i got him home late last night and found the raft gone we said that little rascal has stole our raft and shook us and run off down the river   
 i wouldn t shake my  nigger  would i   the only nigger i had in the world and the only property  
 we never thought of that 
fact is i reckon we d come to consider him our  nigger yes we did consider him so  goodness knows we had trouble enough for him 
so when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke there warn t anything for it but to try the royal nonesuch another shake 
and i ve pegged along ever since dry as a powder horn 
where s that ten cents 
give it here  
i had considerable money so i give him ten cents but begged him to spend it for something to eat and give me some because it was all the money i had and i hadn t had nothing to eat since yesterday 
he never said nothing 
the next minute he whirls on me and says  do you reckon that nigger would blow on us 
we d skin him if he done that  
 how can he blow 
hain t he run off  
 no 
that old fool sold him and never divided with me and the money s gone  
 sold  him  
i says and begun to cry why he was  my  nigger and that was my money 
where is he   i want my nigger  
 well you can t  get  your nigger that s all  so dry up your blubbering 
looky here  do you think  you d  venture to blow on us 
blamed if i think i d trust you 
why if you  was  to blow on us    he stopped but i never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before 
i went on a whimpering and says  i don t want to blow on nobody and i ain t got no time to blow nohow 
i got to turn out and find my nigger  
he looked kinder bothered and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm thinking and wrinkling up his forehead 
at last he says  i ll tell you something 
we got to be here three days 
if you ll promise you won t blow and won t let the nigger blow i ll tell you where to find him  
so i promised and he says  a farmer by the name of silas ph   and then he stopped 
you see he started to tell me the truth but when he stopped that way and begun to study and think again i reckoned he was changing his mind 
and so he was 
he wouldn t trust me he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days 
so pretty soon he says  the man that bought him is named abram foster  abram g foster  and he lives forty mile back here in the country on the road to lafayette  
 all right  i says i can walk it in three days 
and i ll start this very afternoon  
 no you wont you ll start  now  and don t you lose any time about it neither nor do any gabbling by the way 
just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along and then you won t get into trouble with us  d ye hear  
that was the order i wanted and that was the one i played for 
i wanted to be left free to work my plans 
 so clear out  he says and you can tell mr foster whatever you want to 
maybe you can get him to believe that jim  is  your nigger  some idiots don t require documents  leastways i ve heard there s such down south here 
and when you tell him the handbill and the reward s bogus maybe he ll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting em out 
go long now and tell him anything you want to but mind you don t work your jaw any  between  here and there  
so i left and struck for the back country 
i didn t look around but i kinder felt like he was watching me 
but i knowed i could tire him out at that 
i went straight out in the country as much as a mile before i stopped then i doubled back through the woods towards phelps  
i reckoned i better start in on my plan straight off without fooling around because i wanted to stop jim s mouth till these fellows could get away 
i didn t want no trouble with their kind 
i d seen all i wanted to of them and wanted to get entirely shut of them 
chapter xxxii 
when i got there it was all still and sunday like and hot and sunshiny the hands was gone to the fields and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody s dead and gone and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful because you feel like it s spirits whispering  spirits that s been dead ever so many years  and you always think they re talking about  you 
as a general thing it makes a body wish  he  was dead too and done with it all 
phelps was one of these little one horse cotton plantations and they all look alike 
a rail fence round a two acre yard a stile made out of logs sawed off and up ended in steps like barrels of a different length to climb over the fence with and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a horse some sickly grass patches in the big yard but mostly it was bare and smooth like an old hat with the nap rubbed off big double log house for the white folks  hewed logs with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar and these mud stripes been whitewashed some time or another round log kitchen with a big broad open but roofed passage joining it to the house log smoke house back of the kitchen three little log nigger cabins in a row t other side the smoke house one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence and some outbuildings down a piece the other side ash hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut bench by the kitchen door with bucket of water and a gourd hound asleep there in the sun more hounds asleep round about about three shade trees away off in a corner some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch then the cotton fields begins and after the fields the woods 
i went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen 
when i got a little ways i heard the dim hum of a spinning wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again and then i knowed for certain i wished i was dead  for that  is  the lonesomest sound in the whole world 
i went right along not fixing up any particular plan but just trusting to providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come for i d noticed that providence always did put the right words in my mouth if i left it alone 
when i got half way first one hound and then another got up and went for me and of course i stopped and faced them and kept still 
and such another powwow as they made 
in a quarter of a minute i was a kind of a hub of a wheel as you may say  spokes made out of dogs  circle of fifteen of them packed together around me with their necks and noses stretched up towards me a barking and howling and more a coming you could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres 
a nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling pin in her hand singing out begone  you  tige 
you spot 
begone sah  
and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling and then the rest followed and the next second half of them come back wagging their tails around me and making friends with me 
there ain t no harm in a hound nohow 
and behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without anything on but tow linen shirts and they hung on to their mother s gown and peeped out from behind her at me bashful the way they always do 
and here comes the white woman running from the house about forty five or fifty year old bareheaded and her spinning stick in her hand and behind her comes her little white children acting the same way the little niggers was doing 
she was smiling all over so she could hardly stand  and says  it s  you  at last   ain t  it  
i out with a yes m before i thought 
she grabbed me and hugged me tight and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook and the tears come in her eyes and run down over and she couldn t seem to hug and shake enough and kept saying you don t look as much like your mother as i reckoned you would but law sakes i don t care for that i m so glad to see you 
dear dear it does seem like i could eat you up 
children it s your cousin tom   tell him howdy  
but they ducked their heads and put their fingers in their mouths and hid behind her 
so she run on  lize hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away  or did you get your breakfast on the boat  
i said i had got it on the boat 
so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after 
when we got there she set me down in a split bottomed chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says  now i can have a  good  look at you and laws a me i ve been hungry for it a many and a many a time all these long years and it s come at last 
we been expecting you a couple of days and more 
what kep you   boat get aground  
 yes m  she    don t say yes m  say aunt sally 
where d she get aground  
i didn t rightly know what to say because i didn t know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down 
but i go a good deal on instinct and my instinct said she would be coming up  from down towards orleans 
that didn t help me much though for i didn t know the names of bars down that way 
i see i d got to invent a bar or forget the name of the one we got aground on  or  now i struck an idea and fetched it out  it warn t the grounding  that didn t keep us back but a little 
we blowed out a cylinder head  
 good gracious 
anybody hurt  
 no m 
killed a nigger  
 well it s lucky because sometimes people do get hurt 
two years ago last christmas your uncle silas was coming up from newrleans on the old lally rook and she blowed out a cylinder head and crippled a man 
and i think he died afterwards 
he was a baptist 
your uncle silas knowed a family in baton rouge that knowed his people very well 
yes i remember now he  did  die 
mortification set in and they had to amputate him 
but it didn t save him 
yes it was mortification  that was it 
he turned blue all over and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection 
they say he was a sight to look at 
your uncle s been up to the town every day to fetch you 
and he s gone again not more n an hour ago he ll be back any minute now 
you must a met him on the road didn t you   oldish man with a    no i didn t see nobody aunt sally 
the boat landed just at daylight and i left my baggage on the wharf boat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country to put in the time and not get here too soon and so i come down the back way  
 who d you give the baggage to  
 nobody  
 why child it ll be stole  
 not where i hid it i reckon it won t  i says 
 how d you get your breakfast so early on the boat  
it was kinder thin ice but i says  the captain see me standing around and told me i better have something to eat before i went ashore so he took me in the texas to the officers lunch and give me all i wanted  
i was getting so uneasy i couldn t listen good 
i had my mind on the children all the time i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little and find out who i was 
but i couldn t get no show mrs phelps kept it up and run on so 
pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back because she says  but here we re a running on this way and you hain t told me a word about sis nor any of them 
now i ll rest my works a little and you start up yourn just tell me  everything  tell me all about m all every one of m and how they are and what they re doing and what they told you to tell me and every last thing you can think of  
well i see i was up a stump  and up it good 
providence had stood by me this fur all right but i was hard and tight aground now 
i see it warn t a bit of use to try to go ahead  i d got to throw up my hand 
so i says to myself here s another place where i got to resk the truth 
i opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says  here he comes 
stick your head down lower  there that ll do you can t be seen now 
don t you let on you re here 
i ll play a joke on him 
children don t you say a word  
i see i was in a fix now 
but it warn t no use to worry there warn t nothing to do but just hold still and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck 
i had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in then the bed hid him 
mrs phelps she jumps for him and says  has he come  
 no  says her husband 
 good ness  gracious  
she says what in the warld can have become of him  
 i can t imagine  says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy  
 uneasy  
she says i m ready to go distracted 
he  must  a come and you ve missed him along the road 
i  know  it s so  something tells me so  
 why sally i  couldn t  miss him along the road  you  know that  
 but oh dear dear what  will  sis say 
he must a come 
you must a missed him 
he    oh don t distress me any more n i m already distressed 
i don t know what in the world to make of it 
i m at my wit s end and i don t mind acknowledging t i m right down scared 
but there s no hope that he s come for he  couldn t  come and me miss him 
sally it s terrible  just terrible  something s happened to the boat sure  
 why silas 
look yonder   up the road   ain t that somebody coming  
he sprung to the window at the head of the bed and that give mrs phelps the chance she wanted 
she stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull and out i come and when he turned back from the window there she stood a beaming and a smiling like a house afire and i standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside 
the old gentleman stared and says  why who s that  
 who do you reckon t is  
 i hain t no idea 
who  is  it  
 it s  tom sawyer 
by jings i most slumped through the floor 
but there warn t no time to swap knives the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook and kept on shaking and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry and then how they both did fire off questions about sid and mary and the rest of the tribe 
but if they was joyful it warn t nothing to what i was for it was like being born again i was so glad to find out who i was 
well they froze to me for two hours and at last when my chin was so tired it couldn t hardly go any more i had told them more about my family  i mean the sawyer family  than ever happened to any six sawyer families 
and i explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder head at the mouth of white river and it took us three days to fix it 
which was all right and worked first rate because  they  didn t know but what it would take three days to fix it 
if i d a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well 
now i was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side and pretty uncomfortable all up the other 
being tom sawyer was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coughing along down the river 
then i says to myself s pose tom sawyer comes down on that boat 
and s pose he steps in here any minute and sings out my name before i can throw him a wink to keep quiet 
well i couldn t  have  it that way it wouldn t do at all 
i must go up the road and waylay him 
so i told the folks i reckoned i would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage 
the old gentleman was for going along with me but i said no i could drive the horse myself and i druther he wouldn t take no trouble about me 
chapter xxxiii 
so i started for town in the wagon and when i was half way i see a wagon coming and sure enough it was tom sawyer and i stopped and waited till he come along 
i says hold on  
and it stopped alongside and his mouth opened up like a trunk and stayed so and he swallowed two or three times like a person that s got a dry throat and then says  i hain t ever done you no harm 
you know that 
so then what you want to come back and ha nt  me  for  
i says  i hain t come back  i hain t been  gone  
when he heard my voice it righted him up some but he warn t quite satisfied yet 
he says  don t you play nothing on me because i wouldn t on you 
honest injun now you ain t a ghost  
 honest injun i ain t  i says 
 well  i  i  well that ought to settle it of course but i can t somehow seem to understand it no way 
looky here warn t you ever murdered  at all 
 no 
i warn t ever murdered at all  i played it on them 
you come in here and feel of me if you don t believe me  
so he done it and it satisfied him and he was that glad to see me again he didn t know what to do 
and he wanted to know all about it right off because it was a grand adventure and mysterious and so it hit him where he lived 
but i said leave it alone till by and by and told his driver to wait and we drove off a little piece and i told him the kind of a fix i was in and what did he reckon we better do 
he said let him alone a minute and don t disturb him 
so he thought and thought and pretty soon he says  it s all right i ve got it 
take my trunk in your wagon and let on it s your n and you turn back and fool along slow so as to get to the house about the time you ought to and i ll go towards town a piece and take a fresh start and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you and you needn t let on to know me at first  
i says  all right but wait a minute 
there s one more thing  a thing that nobody  don t know but me 
and that is there s a nigger here that i m a trying to steal out of slavery and his name is  jim  old miss watson s jim  
he says  what 
why jim is    he stopped and went to studying 
i says  i know what you ll say 
you ll say it s dirty low down business but what if it is 
i m low down and i m a going to steal him and i want you keep mum and not let on 
will you  
his eye lit up and he says  i ll  help  you steal him  
well i let go all holts then like i was shot 
it was the most astonishing speech i ever heard  and i m bound to say tom sawyer fell considerable in my estimation 
only i couldn t believe it 
tom sawyer a  nigger stealer 
 oh shucks  
i says you re joking  
 i ain t joking either  
 well then  i says joking or no joking if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger don t forget to remember that  you  don t know nothing about him and i don t know nothing about him  
then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon and he drove off his way and i drove mine 
but of course i forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking so i got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip 
the old gentleman was at the door and he says  why this is wonderful 
whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it 
i wish we d a timed her 
and she hain t sweated a hair  not a hair 
it s wonderful 
why i wouldn t take a hundred dollars for that horse now  i wouldn t honest and yet i d a sold her for fifteen before and thought twas all she was worth  
that s all he said 
he was the innocentest best old soul i ever see 
but it warn t surprising because he warn t only just a farmer he was a preacher too and had a little one horse log church down back of the plantation which he built it himself at his own expense for a church and schoolhouse and never charged nothing for his preaching and it was worth it too 
there was plenty other farmer preachers like that and done the same way down south 
in about half an hour tom s wagon drove up to the front stile and aunt sally she see it through the window because it was only about fifty yards and says  why there s somebody come 
i wonder who tis 
why i do believe it s a stranger 
jimmy that s one of the children run and tell lize to put on another plate for dinner  
everybody made a rush for the front door because of course a stranger don t come  every  year and so he lays over the yaller fever for interest when he does come 
tom was over the stile and starting for the house the wagon was spinning up the road for the village and we was all bunched in the front door 
tom had his store clothes on and an audience  and that was always nuts for tom sawyer 
in them circumstances it warn t no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable 
he warn t a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep no he come ca m and important like the ram 
when he got a front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn t want to disturb them and says  mr archibald nichols i presume  
 no my boy  says the old gentleman i m sorry to say t your driver has deceived you nichols s place is down a matter of three mile more 
come in come in  
tom he took a look back over his shoulder and says too late  he s out of sight  
 yes he s gone my son and you must come in and eat your dinner with us and then we ll hitch up and take you down to nichols s  
 oh i  can t  make you so much trouble i couldn t think of it 
i ll walk  i don t mind the distance  
 but we won t  let  you walk  it wouldn t be southern hospitality to do it 
come right in  
 oh  do  says aunt sally it ain t a bit of trouble to us not a bit in the world 
you must stay 
it s a long dusty three mile and we can t let you walk 
and besides i ve already told em to put on another plate when i see you coming so you mustn t disappoint us 
come right in and make yourself at home  
so tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome and let himself be persuaded and come in and when he was in he said he was a stranger from hicksville ohio and his name was william thompson  and he made another bow 
well he run on and on and on making up stuff about hicksville and everybody in it he could invent and i getting a little nervious and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape and at last still talking along he reached over and kissed aunt sally right on the mouth and then settled back again in his chair comfortable and was going on talking but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand and says  you owdacious puppy  
he looked kind of hurt and says  i m surprised at you m am  
 you re s rp  why what do you reckon i am 
i ve a good notion to take and  say what do you mean by kissing me  
he looked kind of humble and says  i didn t mean nothing m am 
i didn t mean no harm 
i  i  thought you d like it  
 why you born fool  
she took up the spinning stick and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it 
 what made you think i d like it  
 well i don t know 
only they  they  told me you would  
 they  told you i would 
whoever told you s  another  lunatic 
i never heard the beat of it 
who s  they  
 why everybody 
they all said so m am  
it was all she could do to hold in and her eyes snapped and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him and she says  who s everybody  
out with their names or ther ll be an idiot short  
he got up and looked distressed and fumbled his hat and says  i m sorry and i warn t expecting it 
they told me to 
they all told me to 
they all said kiss her and said she d like it 
they all said it  every one of them 
but i m sorry m am and i won t do it no more  i won t honest  
 you won t won t you 
well i sh d  reckon  you won t  
 no m i m honest about it i won t ever do it again  till you ask me  
 till i  ask  you 
well i never see the beat of it in my born days 
i lay you ll be the methusalem numskull of creation before ever i ask you  or the likes of you  
 well  he says it does surprise me so 
i can t make it out somehow 
they said you would and i thought you would 
but   he stopped and looked around slow like he wished he could run across a friendly eye somewheres and fetched up on the old gentleman s and says didn t you  think she d like me to kiss her sir  
 why no i  i  well no i b lieve i didn t  
then he looks on around the same way to me and says  tom didn t  you  think aunt sally d open out her arms and say sid sawyer     my land  
she says breaking in and jumping for him you impudent young rascal to fool a body so   and was going to hug him but he fended her off and says  no not till you ve asked me first  
so she didn t lose no time but asked him and hugged him and kissed him over and over again and then turned him over to the old man and he took what was left 
and after they got a little quiet again she says  why dear me i never see such a surprise 
we warn t looking for  you  at all but only tom 
sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him  
 it s because it warn t  intended  for any of us to come but tom  he says but i begged and begged and at the last minute she let me come too so coming down the river me and tom thought it would be a first rate surprise for him to come here to the house first and for me to by and by tag along and drop in and let on to be a stranger 
but it was a mistake aunt sally 
this ain t no healthy place for a stranger to come  
 no  not impudent whelps sid 
you ought to had your jaws boxed i hain t been so put out since i don t know when 
but i don t care i don t mind the terms  i d be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here 
well to think of that performance 
i don t deny it i was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack  
we had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen and there was things enough on that table for seven families  and all hot too none of your flabby tough meat that s laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning 
uncle silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it but it was worth it and it didn t cool it a bit neither the way i ve seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times 
there was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon and me and tom was on the lookout all the time but it warn t no use they didn t happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger and we was afraid to try to work up to it 
but at supper at night one of the little boys says  pa mayn t tom and sid and me go to the show  
 no  says the old man i reckon there ain t going to be any and you couldn t go if there was because the runaway nigger told burton and me all about that scandalous show and burton said he would tell the people so i reckon they ve drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time  
so there it was   but i couldn t help it 
tom and me was to sleep in the same room and bed so being tired we bid good night and went up to bed right after supper and clumb out of the window and down the lightning rod and shoved for the town for i didn t believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint and so if i didn t hurry up and give them one they d get into trouble sure 
on the road tom he told me all about how it was reckoned i was murdered and how pap disappeared pretty soon and didn t come back no more and what a stir there was when jim run away and i told tom all about our royal nonesuch rapscallions and as much of the raft voyage as i had time to and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of it  it was as much as half after eight then  here comes a raging rush of people with torches and an awful whooping and yelling and banging tin pans and blowing horns and we jumped to one side to let them go by and as they went by i see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a rail  that is i knowed it  was  the king and the duke though they was all over tar and feathers and didn t look like nothing in the world that was human  just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier plumes 
well it made me sick to see it and i was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals it seemed like i couldn t ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world 
it was a dreadful thing to see 
human beings  can  be awful cruel to one another 
we see we was too late  couldn t do no good 
we asked some stragglers about it and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage then somebody give a signal and the house rose up and went for them 
so we poked along back home and i warn t feeling so brash as i was before but kind of ornery and humble and to blame somehow  though i hadn t done nothing 
but that s always the way it don t make no difference whether you do right or wrong a person s conscience ain t got no sense and just goes for him anyway 
if i had a yaller dog that didn t know no more than a person s conscience does i would pison him 
it takes up more room than all the rest of a person s insides and yet ain t no good nohow 
tom sawyer he says the same 
chapter xxxiv 
we stopped talking and got to thinking 
by and by tom says  looky here huck what fools we are to not think of it before 
i bet i know where jim is  
 no 
where  
 in that hut down by the ash hopper 
why looky here 
when we was at dinner didn t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles  
 yes  
 what did you think the vittles was for  
 for a dog  
 so d i 
well it wasn t for a dog  
 why  
 because part of it was watermelon  
 so it was  i noticed it 
well it does beat all that i never thought about a dog not eating watermelon 
it shows how a body can see and don t see at the same time  
 well the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in and he locked it again when he came out 
he fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from table  same key i bet 
watermelon shows man lock shows prisoner and it ain t likely there s two prisoners on such a little plantation and where the people s all so kind and good 
jim s the prisoner 
all right  i m glad we found it out detective fashion i wouldn t give shucks for any other way 
now you work your mind and study out a plan to steal jim and i will study out one too and we ll take the one we like the best  
what a head for just a boy to have 
if i had tom sawyer s head i wouldn t trade it off to be a duke nor mate of a steamboat nor clown in a circus nor nothing i can think of 
i went to thinking out a plan but only just to be doing something i knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from 
pretty soon tom says  ready  
 yes  i says 
 all right  bring it out  
 my plan is this  i says 
 we can easy find out if it s jim in there 
then get up my canoe to morrow night and fetch my raft over from the island 
then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man s britches after he goes to bed and shove off down the river on the raft with jim hiding daytimes and running nights the way me and jim used to do before 
wouldn t that plan work  
 work 
why cert nly it would work like rats a fighting 
but it s too blame simple there ain t nothing  to  it 
what s the good of a plan that ain t no more trouble than that 
it s as mild as goose milk 
why huck it wouldn t make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory  
i never said nothing because i warn t expecting nothing different but i knowed mighty well that whenever he got  his  plan ready it wouldn t have none of them objections to it 
and it didn t 
he told me what it was and i see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style and would make jim just as free a man as mine would and maybe get us all killed besides 
so i was satisfied and said we would waltz in on it 
i needn t tell what it was here because i knowed it wouldn t stay the way it was 
i knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance 
and that is what he done 
well one thing was dead sure and that was that tom sawyer was in earnest and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery 
that was the thing that was too many for me 
here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up and had a character to lose and folks at home that had characters and he was bright and not leather headed and knowing and not ignorant and not mean but kind and yet here he was without any more pride or rightness or feeling than to stoop to this business and make himself a shame and his family a shame before everybody 
i  couldn t  understand it no way at all 
it was outrageous and i knowed i ought to just up and tell him so and so be his true friend and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself 
and i  did  start to tell him but he shut me up and says  don t you reckon i know what i m about 
don t i generly know what i m about  
 yes  
 didn t i  say  i was going to help steal the nigger  
 yes  
 well  then  
that s all he said and that s all i said 
it warn t no use to say any more because when he said he d do a thing he always done it 
but i couldn t make out how he was willing to go into this thing so i just let it go and never bothered no more about it 
if he was bound to have it so i couldn t help it 
when we got home the house was all dark and still so we went on down to the hut by the ash hopper for to examine it 
we went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do 
they knowed us and didn t make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night 
when we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides and on the side i warn t acquainted with  which was the north side  we found a square window hole up tolerable high with just one stout board nailed across it 
i says  here s the ticket 
this hole s big enough for jim to get through if we wrench off the board  
tom says  it s as simple as tit tat toe three in a row and as easy as playing hooky 
i should  hope  we can find a way that s a little more complicated than  that  huck finn  
 well then  i says how ll it do to saw him out the way i done before i was murdered that time  
 that s more  like  he says 
 it s real mysterious and troublesome and good  he says but i bet we can find a way that s twice as long 
there ain t no hurry le s keep on looking around  
betwixt the hut and the fence on the back side was a lean to that joined the hut at the eaves and was made out of plank 
it was as long as the hut but narrow  only about six foot wide 
the door to it was at the south end and was padlocked 
tom he went to the soap kettle and searched around and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with so he took it and prized out one of the staples 
the chain fell down and we opened the door and went in and shut it and struck a match and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn t no connection with it and there warn t no floor to the shed nor nothing in it but some old rusty played out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow 
the match went out and so did we and shoved in the staple again and the door was locked as good as ever 
tom was joyful 
he says  now we re all right 
we ll  dig  him out 
it ll take about a week  
then we started for the house and i went in the back door  you only have to pull a buckskin latch string they don t fasten the doors  but that warn t romantical enough for tom sawyer no way would do him but he must climb up the lightning rod 
but after he got up half way about three times and missed fire and fell every time and the last time most busted his brains out he thought he d got to give it up but after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck and this time he made the trip 
in the morning we was up at break of day and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed jim  if it was  jim that was being fed 
the niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields and jim s nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things and whilst the others was leaving the key come from the house 
this nigger had a good natured chuckle headed face and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread 
that was to keep witches off 
he said the witches was pestering him awful these nights and making him see all kinds of strange things and hear all kinds of strange words and noises and he didn t believe he was ever witched so long before in his life 
he got so worked up and got to running on so about his troubles he forgot all about what he d been a going to do 
so tom says  what s the vittles for 
going to feed the dogs  
the nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face like when you heave a brickbat in a mud puddle and he says  yes mars sid a dog 
cur us dog too 
does you want to go en look at im  
 yes  
i hunched tom and whispers  you going right here in the daybreak 
that  warn t the plan  
 no it warn t but it s the plan  now  
so drat him we went along but i didn t like it much 
when we got in we couldn t hardly see anything it was so dark but jim was there sure enough and could see us and he sings out  why  huck 
en good  lan  
ain dat misto tom  
i just knowed how it would be i just expected it 
i didn t know nothing to do and if i had i couldn t a done it because that nigger busted in and says  why de gracious sakes 
do he know you genlmen  
we could see pretty well now 
tom he looked at the nigger steady and kind of wondering and says  does  who  know us  
 why dis yer runaway nigger  
 i don t reckon he does but what put that into your head  
 what  put  it dar 
didn he jis dis minute sing out like he knowed you  
tom says in a puzzled up kind of way  well that s mighty curious 
who  sung out 
when  did he sing out 
what  did he sing out  
and turns to me perfectly ca m and says did  you  hear anybody sing out  
of course there warn t nothing to be said but the one thing so i says  no i ain t heard nobody say nothing  
then he turns to jim and looks him over like he never see him before and says  did you sing out  
 no sah  says jim i hain t said nothing sah  
 not a word  
 no sah i hain t said a word  
 did you ever see us before  
 no sah not as i knows on  
so tom turns to the nigger which was looking wild and distressed and says kind of severe  what do you reckon s the matter with you anyway 
what made you think somebody sung out  
 oh it s de dad blame witches sah en i wisht i was dead i do 
dey s awluz at it sah en dey do mos kill me dey sk yers me so 
please to don t tell nobody bout it sah er ole mars silas he ll scole me kase he say dey  ain t  no witches 
i jis wish to goodness he was heah now  den  what would he say 
i jis bet he couldn fine no way to git aroun it  dis  time 
but it s awluz jis so people dat s  sot  stays sot dey won t look into noth n en fine it out f r deyselves en when  you  fine it out en tell um bout it dey doan b lieve you  
tom give him a dime and said we wouldn t tell nobody and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with and then looks at jim and says  i wonder if uncle silas is going to hang this nigger 
if i was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away i wouldn t give him up i d hang him  
and whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good he whispers to jim and says  don t ever let on to know us 
and if you hear any digging going on nights it s us we re going to set you free  
jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it then the nigger come back and we said we d come again some time if the nigger wanted us to and he said he would more particular if it was dark because the witches went for him mostly in the dark and it was good to have folks around then 
chapter xxxv 
it would be most an hour yet till breakfast so we left and struck down into the woods because tom said we got to have  some  light to see how to dig by and a lantern makes too much and might get us into trouble what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that s called fox fire and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place 
we fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds and set down to rest and tom says kind of dissatisfied  blame it this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be 
and so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan 
there ain t no watchman to be drugged  now there  ought  to be a watchman 
there ain t even a dog to give a sleeping mixture to 
and there s jim chained by one leg with a ten foot chain to the leg of his bed why all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain 
and uncle silas he trusts everybody sends the key to the punkin headed nigger and don t send nobody to watch the nigger 
jim could a got out of that window hole before this only there wouldn t be no use trying to travel with a ten foot chain on his leg 
why drat it huck it s the stupidest arrangement i ever see 
you got to invent  all  the difficulties 
well we can t help it we got to do the best we can with the materials we ve got 
anyhow there s one thing  there s more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers where there warn t one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them and you had to contrive them all out of your own head 
now look at just that one thing of the lantern 
when you come down to the cold facts we simply got to  let on  that a lantern s resky 
why we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to i believe 
now whilst i think of it we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get  
 what do we want of a saw  
 what do we  want  of it 
hain t we got to saw the leg of jim s bed off so as to get the chain loose  
 why you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off  
 well if that ain t just like you huck finn 
you  can  get up the infant schooliest ways of going at a thing 
why hain t you ever read any books at all   baron trenck nor casanova nor benvenuto chelleeny nor henri iv  nor none of them heroes 
who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old maidy way as that 
no the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed leg in two and leave it just so and swallow the sawdust so it can t be found and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can t see no sign of it s being sawed and thinks the bed leg is perfectly sound 
then the night you re ready fetch the leg a kick down she goes slip off your chain and there you are 
nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements shin down it break your leg in the moat  because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short you know  and there s your horses and your trusty vassles and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle and away you go to your native langudoc or navarre or wherever it is 
it s gaudy huck 
i wish there was a moat to this cabin 
if we get time the night of the escape we ll dig one  
i says  what do we want of a moat when we re going to snake him out from under the cabin  
but he never heard me 
he had forgot me and everything else 
he had his chin in his hand thinking 
pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head then sighs again and says  no it wouldn t do  there ain t necessity enough for it  
 for what  
i says 
 why to saw jim s leg off  he says 
 good land  
i says why there ain t  no  necessity for it 
and what would you want to saw his leg off for anyway  
 well some of the best authorities has done it 
they couldn t get the chain off so they just cut their hand off and shoved 
and a leg would be better still 
but we got to let that go 
there ain t necessity enough in this case and besides jim s a nigger and wouldn t understand the reasons for it and how it s the custom in europe so we ll let it go 
but there s one thing  he can have a rope ladder we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough 
and we can send it to him in a pie it s mostly done that way 
and i ve et worse pies  
 why tom sawyer how you talk  i says jim ain t got no use for a rope ladder  
 he  has  got use for it 
how  you  talk you better say you don t know nothing about it 
he s  got  to have a rope ladder they all do  
 what in the nation can he  do  with it  
 do  with it 
he can hide it in his bed can t he  
that s what they all do and  he s  got to too 
huck you don t ever seem to want to do anything that s regular you want to be starting something fresh all the time 
s pose he  don t  do nothing with it 
ain t it there in his bed for a clew after he s gone 
and don t you reckon they ll want clews 
of course they will 
and you wouldn t leave them any 
that would be a pretty  howdy do  wouldn t  it 
i never heard of such a thing  
 well  i says if it s in the regulations and he s got to have it all right let him have it because i don t wish to go back on no regulations but there s one thing tom sawyer  if we go to tearing up our sheets to make jim a rope ladder we re going to get into trouble with aunt sally just as sure as you re born 
now the way i look at it a hickry bark ladder don t cost nothing and don t waste nothing and is just as good to load up a pie with and hide in a straw tick as any rag ladder you can start and as for jim he ain t had no experience and so he don t care what kind of a    oh shucks huck finn if i was as ignorant as you i d keep still  that s what i d do 
who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickry bark ladder 
why it s perfectly ridiculous  
 well all right tom fix it your own way but if you ll take my advice you ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline  
he said that would do 
and that gave him another idea and he says  borrow a shirt too  
 what do we want of a shirt tom  
 want it for jim to keep a journal on  
 journal your granny  jim  can t write  
 s pose he  can t  write  he can make marks on the shirt can t he if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrel hoop  
 why tom we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one and quicker too  
 prisoners  don t have geese running around the donjon keep to pull pens out of you muggins 
they  always  make their pens out of the hardest toughest troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out too because they ve got to do it by rubbing it on the wall 
they  wouldn t use a goose quill if they had it 
it ain t regular  
 well then what ll we make him the ink out of  
 many makes it out of iron rust and tears but that s the common sort and women the best authorities uses their own blood 
jim can do that and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he s captivated he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window 
the iron mask always done that and it s a blame good way too  
 jim ain t got no tin plates 
they feed him in a pan  
 that ain t nothing we can get him some  
 can t nobody  read  his plates  
 that ain t got anything to  do  with it huck finn 
all  he s  got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out 
you don t  have  to be able to read it 
why half the time you can t read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate or anywhere else  
 well then what s the sense in wasting the plates  
 why blame it all it ain t the  prisoner s  plates  
 but it s  somebody s  plates ain t it  
 well spos n it is 
what does the  prisoner  care whose    he broke off there because we heard the breakfast horn blowing 
so we cleared out for the house 
along during the morning i borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothes line and i found an old sack and put them in it and we went down and got the fox fire and put that in too 
i called it borrowing because that was what pap always called it but tom said it warn t borrowing it was stealing 
he said we was representing prisoners and prisoners don t care how they get a thing so they get it and nobody don t blame them for it either 
it ain t no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with tom said it s his right and so as long as we was representing a prisoner we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with 
he said if we warn t prisoners it would be a very different thing and nobody but a mean ornery person would steal when he warn t a prisoner 
so we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy 
and yet he made a mighty fuss one day after that when i stole a watermelon out of the nigger patch and eat it and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for 
tom said that what he meant was we could steal anything we needed 
well i says i needed the watermelon 
but he said i didn t need it to get out of prison with there s where the difference was 
he said if i d a wanted it to hide a knife in and smuggle it to jim to kill the seneskal with it would a been all right 
so i let it go at that though i couldn t see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if i got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold leaf distinctions like that every time i see a chance to hog a watermelon 
well as i was saying we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business and nobody in sight around the yard then tom he carried the sack into the lean to whilst i stood off a piece to keep watch 
by and by he come out and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk 
he says  everything s all right now except tools and that s easy fixed  
 tools  
i says 
 yes  
 tools for what  
 why to dig with 
we ain t a going to  gnaw  him out are we  
 ain t them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with  
i says 
he turns on me looking pitying enough to make a body cry and says  huck finn did you  ever  hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with 
now i want to ask you  if you got any reasonableness in you at all  what kind of a show would  that  give him to be a hero 
why they might as well lend him the key and done with it 
picks and shovels  why they wouldn t furnish em to a king  
 well then  i says if we don t want the picks and shovels what do we want  
 a couple of case knives  
 to dig the foundations out from under that cabin with  
 yes  
 confound it it s foolish tom  
 it don t make no difference how foolish it is it s the  right  way  and it s the regular way 
and there ain t no  other  way that ever i heard of and i ve read all the books that gives any information about these things 
they always dig out with a case knife  and not through dirt mind you generly it s through solid rock 
and it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks and for ever and ever 
why look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the castle deef in the harbor of marseilles that dug himself out that way how long was  he  at it you reckon  
 i don t know  
 well guess  
 i don t know 
a month and a half  
 thirty seven year  and he come out in china 
that s  the kind 
i wish the bottom of  this  fortress was solid rock  
 jim  don t know nobody in china  
 what s  that  got to do with it 
neither did that other fellow 
but you re always a wandering off on a side issue 
why can t you stick to the main point  
 all right  i don t care where he comes out so he  comes  out and jim don t either i reckon 
but there s one thing anyway  jim s too old to be dug out with a case knife 
he won t last  
 yes he will  last  too 
you don t reckon it s going to take thirty seven years to dig out through a  dirt  foundation do you  
 how long will it take tom  
 well we can t resk being as long as we ought to because it mayn t take very long for uncle silas to hear from down there by new orleans 
he ll hear jim ain t from there 
then his next move will be to advertise jim or something like that 
so we can t resk being as long digging him out as we ought to 
by rights i reckon we ought to be a couple of years but we can t 
things being so uncertain what i recommend is this that we really dig right in as quick as we can and after that we can  let on  to ourselves that we was at it thirty seven years 
then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there s an alarm 
yes i reckon that ll be the best way  
 now there s  sense  in that  i says 
 letting on don t cost nothing letting on ain t no trouble and if it s any object i don t mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year 
it wouldn t strain me none after i got my hand in 
so i ll mosey along now and smouch a couple of case knives  
 smouch three  he says we want one to make a saw out of  
 tom if it ain t unregular and irreligious to sejest it  i says there s an old rusty saw blade around yonder sticking under the weather boarding behind the smoke house  
he looked kind of weary and discouraged like and says  it ain t no use to try to learn you nothing huck 
run along and smouch the knives  three of them  
so i done it 
chapter xxxvi 
as soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightning rod and shut ourselves up in the lean to and got out our pile of fox fire and went to work 
we cleared everything out of the way about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log 
tom said he was right behind jim s bed now and we d dig in under it and when we got through there couldn t nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there because jim s counter pin hung down most to the ground and you d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole 
so we dug and dug with the case knives till most midnight and then we was dog tired and our hands was blistered and yet you couldn t see we d done anything hardly 
at last i says  this ain t no thirty seven year job this is a thirty eight year job tom sawyer  
he never said nothing 
but he sighed and pretty soon he stopped digging and then for a good little while i knowed that he was thinking 
then he says  it ain t no use huck it ain t a going to work 
if we was prisoners it would because then we d have as many years as we wanted and no hurry and we wouldn t get but a few minutes to dig every day while they was changing watches and so our hands wouldn t get blistered and we could keep it up right along year in and year out and do it right and the way it ought to be done 
but  we  can t fool along we got to rush we ain t got no time to spare 
if we was to put in another night this way we d have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well  couldn t touch a case knife with them sooner  
 well then what we going to do tom  
 i ll tell you 
it ain t right and it ain t moral and i wouldn t like it to get out but there ain t only just the one way we got to dig him out with the picks and  let on  it s case knives  
 now  you re  talking  
i says your head gets leveler and leveler all the time tom sawyer  i says 
 picks is the thing moral or no moral and as for me i don t care shucks for the morality of it nohow 
when i start in to steal a nigger or a watermelon or a sunday school book i ain t no ways particular how it s done so it s done 
what i want is my nigger or what i want is my watermelon or what i want is my sunday school book and if a pick s the handiest thing that s the thing i m a going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that sunday school book out with and i don t give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther  
 well  he says there s excuse for picks and letting on in a case like this if it warn t so i wouldn t approve of it nor i wouldn t stand by and see the rules broke  because right is right and wrong is wrong and a body ain t got no business doing wrong when he ain t ignorant and knows better 
it might answer for  you  to dig jim out with a pick without  any letting on because you don t know no better but it wouldn t for me because i do know better 
gimme a case knife  
he had his own by him but i handed him mine 
he flung it down and says  gimme a  case knife  
i didn t know just what to do  but then i thought 
i scratched around amongst the old tools and got a pickaxe and give it to him and he took it and went to work and never said a word 
he was always just that particular 
full of principle 
so then i got a shovel and then we picked and shoveled turn about and made the fur fly 
we stuck to it about a half an hour which was as long as we could stand up but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it 
when i got up stairs i looked out at the window and see tom doing his level best with the lightning rod but he couldn t come it his hands was so sore 
at last he says  it ain t no use it can t be done 
what you reckon i better do 
can t you think of no way  
 yes  i says but i reckon it ain t regular 
come up the stairs and let on it s a lightning rod  
so he done it 
next day tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house for to make some pens for jim out of and six tallow candles and i hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance and stole three tin plates 
tom says it wasn t enough but i said nobody wouldn t ever see the plates that jim throwed out because they d fall in the dog fennel and jimpson weeds under the window hole  then we could tote them back and he could use them over again 
so tom was satisfied 
then he says  now the thing to study out is how to get the things to jim  
 take them in through the hole  i says when we get it done  
he only just looked scornful and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea and then he went to studying 
by and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways but there warn t no need to decide on any of them yet 
said we d got to post jim first 
that night we went down the lightning rod a little after ten and took one of the candles along and listened under the window hole and heard jim snoring so we pitched it in and it didn t wake him 
then we whirled in with the pick and shovel and in about two hours and a half the job was done 
we crept in under jim s bed and into the cabin and pawed around and found the candle and lit it and stood over jim awhile and found him looking hearty and healthy and then we woke him up gentle and gradual 
he was so glad to see us he most cried and called us honey and all the pet names he could think of and was for having us hunt up a cold chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away and clearing out without losing any time 
but tom he showed him how unregular it would be and set down and told him all about our plans and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm and not to be the least afraid because we would see he got away  sure 
so jim he said it was all right and we set there and talked over old times awhile and then tom asked a lot of questions and when jim told him uncle silas come in every day or two to pray with him and aunt sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat and both of them was kind as they could be tom says   now  i know how to fix it 
we ll send you some things by them  
i said don t do nothing of the kind it s one of the most jackass ideas i ever struck  but he never paid no attention to me went right on 
it was his way when he d got his plans set 
so he told jim how we d have to smuggle in the rope ladder pie and other large things by nat the nigger that fed him and he must be on the lookout and not be surprised and not let nat see him open them and we would put small things in uncle s coat pockets and he must steal them out and we would tie things to aunt s apron strings or put them in her apron pocket if we got a chance and told him what they would be and what they was for 
and told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood and all that 
he told him everything 
jim he couldn t see no sense in the most of it but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him so he was satisfied and said he would do it all just as tom said 
jim had plenty corn cob pipes and tobacco so we had a right down good sociable time then we crawled out through the hole and so home to bed with hands that looked like they d been chawed 
tom was in high spirits 
he said it was the best fun he ever had in his life and the most intellectural and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave jim to our children to get out for he believed jim would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it 
he said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year and would be the best time on record 
and he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it 
in the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes and tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket 
then we went to the nigger cabins and while i got nat s notice off tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn pone that was in jim s pan and we went along with nat to see how it would work and it just worked noble when jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out and there warn t ever anything could a worked better 
tom said so himself 
jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that s always getting into bread you know but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first 
and whilst we was a standing there in the dimmish light here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under jim s bed and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them and there warn t hardly room in there to get your breath 
by jings we forgot to fasten that lean to door 
the nigger nat he only just hollered witches once and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs and begun to groan like he was dying 
tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of jim s meat and the dogs went for it and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door and i knowed he d fixed the other door too 
then he went to work on the nigger coaxing him and petting him and asking him if he d been imagining he saw something again 
he raised up and blinked his eyes around and says  mars sid you ll say i s a fool but if i didn t b lieve i see most a million dogs er devils er some n i wisht i may die right heah in dese tracks 
i did mos sholy 
mars sid i  felt  um  i  felt  um sah dey was all over me 
dad fetch it i jis wisht i could git my han s on one er dem witches jis wunst  on y jis wunst  it s all i d ast 
but mos ly i wisht dey d lemme lone i does  
tom says  well i tell you what i think 
what makes them come here just at this runaway nigger s breakfast time 
it s because they re hungry that s the reason 
you make them a witch pie that s the thing for  you  to do  
 but my lan  mars sid how s i gwyne to make m a witch pie 
i doan know how to make it 
i hain t ever hearn er sich a thing b fo   
 well then i ll have to make it myself  
 will you do it honey   will you 
i ll wusshup de groun und yo foot i will  
 all right i ll do it seeing it s you and you ve been good to us and showed us the runaway nigger 
but you got to be mighty careful 
when we come around you turn your back and then whatever we ve put in the pan don t you let on you see it at all 
and don t you look when jim unloads the pan  something might happen i don t know what 
and above all don t you  handle  the witch things  
 hannel m  mars sid 
what  is  you a talkin bout 
i wouldn lay de weight er my finger on um not f r ten hund d thous n billion dollars i wouldn t  
chapter xxxvii 
that was all fixed 
so then we went away and went to the rubbage pile in the back yard where they keep the old boots and rags and pieces of bottles and wore out tin things and all such truck and scratched around and found an old tin washpan and stopped up the holes as well as we could to bake the pie in and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast and found a couple of shingle nails that tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with and dropped one of them in aunt sally s apron pocket which was hanging on a chair and t other we stuck in the band of uncle silas s hat which was on the bureau because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger s house this morning and then went to breakfast and tom dropped the pewter spoon in uncle silas s coat pocket and aunt sally wasn t come yet so we had to wait a little while 
and when she come she was hot and red and cross and couldn t hardly wait for the blessing and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest child s head with her thimble with the other and says  i ve hunted high and i ve hunted low and it does beat all what  has  become of your other shirt  
my heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things and a hard piece of corn crust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a cough and was shot across the table and took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing worm and let a cry out of him the size of a warwhoop and tom he turned kinder blue around the gills and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that and i would a sold out for half price if there was a bidder 
but after that we was all right again  it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold 
uncle silas he says  it s most uncommon curious i can t understand it 
i know perfectly well i took it  off  because    because you hain t got but one  on 
just  listen  at the man 
i know you took it off and know it by a better way than your wool gethering memory too because it was on the clo s line yesterday  i see it there myself 
but it s gone that s the long and the short of it and you ll just have to change to a red flann l one till i can get time to make a new one 
and it ll be the third i ve made in two years 
it just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts and whatever you do manage to do  with m all is more n i can make out 
a body d think you  would  learn to take some sort of care of em at your time of life  
 i know it sally and i do try all i can 
but it oughtn t to be altogether my fault because you know i don t see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they re on me and i don t believe i ve ever lost one of them  off  of me  
 well it ain t  your  fault if you haven t silas you d a done it if you could i reckon 
and the shirt ain t all that s gone nuther 
ther s a spoon gone and  that  ain t all 
there was ten and now ther s only nine 
the calf got the shirt i reckon but the calf never took the spoon  that s  certain  
 why what else is gone sally  
 ther s six  candles  gone  that s what 
the rats could a got the candles and i reckon they did i wonder they don t walk off with the whole place the way you re always going to stop their holes and don t do it and if they warn t fools they d sleep in your hair silas  you d  never find it out but you can t lay the  spoon  on the rats and that i know  
 well sally i m in fault and i acknowledge it i ve been remiss but i won t let to morrow go by without stopping up them holes  
 oh i wouldn t hurry next year ll do 
matilda angelina araminta phelps 
whack comes the thimble and the child snatches her claws out of the sugar bowl without fooling around any 
just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage and says  missus dey s a sheet gone  
 a  sheet  gone 
well for the land s sake  
 i ll stop up them holes to day  says uncle silas looking sorrowful 
 oh  do  shet up   s pose the rats took the  sheet 
where s  it gone lize  
 clah to goodness i hain t no notion miss sally 
she wuz on de clo sline yistiddy but she done gone she ain dah no mo now  
 i reckon the world  is  coming to an end 
i  never  see the beat of it in all my born days 
a shirt and a sheet and a spoon and six can    missus  comes a young yaller wench dey s a brass cannelstick miss n  
 cler out from here you hussy er i ll take a skillet to ye  
well she was just a biling 
i begun to lay for a chance i reckoned i would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated 
she kept a raging right along running her insurrection all by herself and everybody else mighty meek and quiet and at last uncle silas looking kind of foolish fishes up that spoon out of his pocket 
she stopped with her mouth open and her hands up and as for me i wished i was in jeruslem or somewheres 
but not long because she says  it s  just  as i expected 
so you had it in your pocket all the time and like as not you ve got the other things there too 
how d it get there  
 i reely don t know sally  he says kind of apologizing or you know i would tell 
i was a studying over my text in acts seventeen before breakfast and i reckon i put it in there not noticing meaning to put my testament in and it must be so because my testament ain t in but i ll go and see and if the testament is where i had it i ll know i didn t put it in and that will show that i laid the testament down and took up the spoon and    oh for the land s sake 
give a body a rest 
go long now the whole kit and biling of ye and don t come nigh me again till i ve got back my peace of mind  
i d a heard her if she d a said it to herself let alone speaking it out and i d a got up and obeyed her if i d a been dead 
as we was passing through the setting room the old man he took up his hat and the shingle nail fell out on the floor and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantel shelf and never said nothing and went out 
tom see him do it and remembered about the spoon and says  well it ain t no use to send things by  him  no more he ain t reliable  
then he says  but he done us a good turn with the spoon anyway without knowing it and so we ll go and do him one without  him  knowing it  stop up his rat holes  
there was a noble good lot of them down cellar and it took us a whole hour but we done the job tight and good and shipshape 
then we heard steps on the stairs and blowed out our light and hid and here comes the old man with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t other looking as absent minded as year before last 
he went a mooning around first to one rat hole and then another till he d been to them all 
then he stood about five minutes picking tallow drip off of his candle and thinking 
then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs saying  well for the life of me i can t remember when i done it 
i could show her now that i warn t to blame on account of the rats 
but never mind  let it go 
i reckon it wouldn t do no good  
and so he went on a mumbling up stairs and then we left 
he was a mighty nice old man 
and always is 
tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon but he said we d got to have it so he took a think 
when he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do then we went and waited around the spoon basket till we see aunt sally coming and then tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side and i slid one of them up my sleeve and tom says  why aunt sally there ain t but nine spoons  yet  
she says  go long to your play and don t bother me 
i know better i counted m myself  
 well i ve counted them twice aunty and i can t make but nine  
she looked out of all patience but of course she come to count  anybody would 
 i declare to gracious ther  ain t  but nine  
she says 
 why what in the world  plague  take  the things i ll count m again  
so i slipped back the one i had and when she got done counting she says  hang the troublesome rubbage ther s  ten  now  
and she looked huffy and bothered both 
but tom says  why aunty i don t think there s ten  
 you numskull didn t you see me  count m 
 i know but    well i ll count m  again  
so i smouched one and they come out nine same as the other time 
well she  was  in a tearing way  just a trembling all over she was so mad 
but she counted and counted till she got that addled she d start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes and so three times they come out right and three times they come out wrong 
then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley west and she said cle r out and let her have some peace and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she d skin us 
so we had the odd spoon and dropped it in her apron pocket whilst she was a giving us our sailing orders and jim got it all right along with her shingle nail before noon 
we was very well satisfied with this business and tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took because he said  now  she couldn t ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life and wouldn t believe she d counted them right if she  did  and said that after she d about counted her head off for the next three days he judged she d give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more 
so we put the sheet back on the line that night and stole one out of her closet and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of days till she didn t know how many sheets she had any more and she didn t  care  and warn t a going to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it and wouldn t count them again not to save her life she druther die first 
so we was all right now as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed up counting and as to the candlestick it warn t no consequence it would blow over by and by 
but that pie was a job we had no end of trouble with that pie 
we fixed it up away down in the woods and cooked it there and we got it done at last and very satisfactory too but not all in one day and we had to use up three wash pans full of flour before we got through and we got burnt pretty much all over in places and eyes put out with the smoke because you see we didn t want nothing but a crust and we couldn t prop it up right and she would always cave in 
but of course we thought of the right way at last  which was to cook the ladder too in the pie 
so then we laid in with jim the second night and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with 
we let on it took nine months to make it 
and in the forenoon we took it down to the woods but it wouldn t go into the pie 
being made of a whole sheet that way there was rope enough for forty pies if we d a wanted them and plenty left over for soup or sausage or anything you choose 
we could a had a whole dinner 
but we didn t need it 
all we needed was just enough for the pie and so we throwed the rest away 
we didn t cook none of the pies in the wash pan  afraid the solder would melt but uncle silas he had a noble brass warming pan which he thought considerable of because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from england with william the conqueror in the mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable not on account of being any account because they warn t but on account of them being relicts you know and we snaked her out private and took her down there but she failed on the first pies because we didn t know how but she come up smiling on the last one 
we took and lined her with dough and set her in the coals and loaded her up with rag rope and put on a dough roof and shut down the lid and put hot embers on top and stood off five foot with the long handle cool and comfortable and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at 
but the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along for if that rope ladder wouldn t cramp him down to business i don t know nothing what i m talking about and lay him in enough stomach ache to last him till next time too 
nat didn t look when we put the witch pie in jim s pan and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles and so jim got everything all right and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window hole 
chapter xxxviii 
making them pens was a distressid tough job and so was the saw and jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all 
that s the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall 
but he had to have it tom said he d  got  to there warn t no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind and his coat of arms 
 look at lady jane grey  he says look at gilford dudley look at old northumberland 
why huck s pose it  is  considerble trouble   what you going to do   how you going to get around it 
jim s  got  to do his inscription and coat of arms 
they all do  
jim says  why mars tom i hain t got no coat o arm i hain t got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt en you knows i got to keep de journal on dat  
 oh you don t understand jim a coat of arms is very different  
 well  i says jim s right anyway when he says he ain t got no coat of arms because he hain t  
 i reckon i knowed that  tom says but you bet he ll have one before he goes out of this  because he s going out  right  and there ain t going to be no flaws in his record  
so whilst me and jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece jim a making his n out of the brass and i making mine out of the spoon tom set to work to think out the coat of arms 
by and by he said he d struck so many good ones he didn t hardly know which to take but there was one which he reckoned he d decide on 
he says  on the scutcheon we ll have a bend  or  in the dexter base a saltire murrey  in the fess with a dog couchant for common charge and under his foot a chain embattled for slavery with a chevron  vert  in a chief engrailed and three invected lines on a field  azure  with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented crest a runaway nigger sable  with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister and a couple of gules for supporters which is you and me motto  maggiore fretta minore otto 
got it out of a book  means the more haste the less speed  
 geewhillikins  i says but what does the rest of it mean  
 we ain t got no time to bother over that  he says we got to dig in like all git out  
 well anyway  i says what s  some  of it 
what s a fess  
 a fess  a fess is  you  don t need to know what a fess is 
i ll show him how to make it when he gets to it  
 shucks tom  i says i think you might tell a person 
what s a bar sinister  
 oh i don t know 
but he s got to have it 
all the nobility does  
that was just his way 
if it didn t suit him to explain a thing to you he wouldn t do it 
you might pump at him a week it wouldn t make no difference 
he d got all that coat of arms business fixed so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work which was to plan out a mournful inscription  said jim got to have one like they all done 
he made up a lot and wrote them out on a paper and read them off so   
here a captive heart busted 
  
here a poor prisoner forsook by the world and friends fretted his sorrowful life 
  
here a lonely heart broke and a worn spirit went to its rest after thirty seven years of solitary captivity 
  
here homeless and friendless after thirty seven years of bitter captivity perished a noble stranger natural son of louis xiv 
tom s voice trembled whilst he was reading them and he most broke down 
when he got done he couldn t no way make up his mind which one for jim to scrabble on to the wall they was all so good but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on 
jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail and he didn t know how to make letters besides but tom said he would block them out for him and then he wouldn t have nothing to do but just follow the lines 
then pretty soon he says  come to think the logs ain t a going to do they don t have log walls in a dungeon we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock 
we ll fetch a rock  
jim said the rock was worse than the logs he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn t ever get out 
but tom said he would let me help him do it 
then he took a look to see how me and jim was getting along with the pens 
it was most pesky tedious hard work and slow and didn t give my hands no show to get well of the sores and we didn t seem to make no headway hardly so tom says  i know how to fix it 
we got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions and we can kill two birds with that same rock 
there s a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill and we ll smouch it and carve the things on it and file out the pens and the saw on it too  
it warn t no slouch of an idea and it warn t no slouch of a grindstone nuther but we allowed we d tackle it 
it warn t quite midnight yet so we cleared out for the mill leaving jim at work 
we smouched the grindstone and set out to roll her home but it was a most nation tough job 
sometimes do what we could we couldn t keep her from falling over and she come mighty near mashing us every time 
tom said she was going to get one of us sure before we got through 
we got her half way and then we was plumb played out and most drownded with sweat 
we see it warn t no use we got to go and fetch jim 
so he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed leg and wrapt it round and round his neck and we crawled out through our hole and down there and jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing and tom superintended 
he could out superintend any boy i ever see 
he knowed how to do everything 
our hole was pretty big but it warn t big enough to get the grindstone through but jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough 
then tom marked out them things on it with the nail and set jim to work on them with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the lean to for a hammer and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him and then he could go to bed and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it 
then we helped him fix his chain back on the bed leg and was ready for bed ourselves 
but tom thought of something and says  you got any spiders in here jim  
 no sah thanks to goodness i hain t mars tom  
 all right we ll get you some  
 but bless you honey i doan  want  none 
i s afeard un um 
i jis s soon have rattlesnakes aroun   
tom thought a minute or two and says  it s a good idea 
and i reckon it s been done 
it  must  a been done it stands to reason 
yes it s a prime good idea 
where could you keep it  
 keep what mars tom  
 why a rattlesnake  
 de goodness gracious alive mars tom 
why if dey was a rattlesnake to come in heah i d take en bust right out thoo dat log wall i would wid my head  
 why jim you wouldn t be afraid of it after a little 
you could tame it  
 tame  it  
 yes  easy enough 
every animal is grateful for kindness and petting and they wouldn t  think  of hurting a person that pets them 
any book will tell you that 
you try  that s all i ask just try for two or three days 
why you can get him so in a little while that he ll love you and sleep with you and won t stay away from you a minute and will let you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth  
 please  mars tom  doan  talk so 
i can t  stan  it 
he d  let  me shove his head in my mouf  fer a favor hain t it 
i lay he d wait a pow ful long time fo i  ast  him 
en mo en dat i doan  want  him to sleep wid me  
 jim don t act so foolish 
a prisoner s  got  to have some kind of a dumb pet and if a rattlesnake hain t ever been tried why there s more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life  
 why mars tom i doan  want  no sich glory 
snake take n bite jim s chin off den  whah  is de glory 
no sah i doan want no sich doin s  
 blame it can t you  try 
i only  want  you to try  you needn t keep it up if it don t work  
 but de trouble all  done  ef de snake bite me while i s a tryin him 
mars tom i s willin to tackle mos anything at ain t onreasonable but ef you en huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame i s gwyne to  leave  dat s  shore  
 well then let it go let it go if you re so bull headed about it 
we can get you some garter snakes and you can tie some buttons on their tails and let on they re rattlesnakes and i reckon that ll have to do  
 i k n stan  dem  mars tom but blame f i couldn get along widout um i tell you dat 
i never knowed b fo t was so much bother and trouble to be a prisoner  
 well it  always  is when it s done right 
you got any rats around here  
 no sah i hain t seed none  
 well we ll get you some rats  
 why mars tom i doan  want  no rats 
dey s de dadblamedest creturs to sturb a body en rustle roun over im en bite his feet when he s tryin to sleep i ever see 
no sah gimme g yarter snakes f i s got to have m but doan gimme no rats i hain got no use f r um skasely  
 but jim you  got  to have em  they all do 
so don t make no more fuss about it 
prisoners ain t ever without rats 
there ain t no instance of it 
and they train them and pet them and learn them tricks and they get to be as sociable as flies 
but you got to play music to them 
you got anything to play music on  
 i ain got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o paper en a juice harp but i reck n dey wouldn take no stock in a juice harp  
 yes they would they  don t care what kind of music tis 
a jews harp s plenty good enough for a rat 
all animals like music  in a prison they dote on it 
specially painful music and you can t get no other kind out of a jews harp 
it always interests them they come out to see what s the matter with you 
yes you re all right you re fixed very well 
you want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep and early in the mornings and play your jews harp play the last link is broken   that s the thing that ll scoop a rat quicker n anything else and when you ve played about two minutes you ll see all the rats and the snakes and spiders and things begin to feel worried about you and come 
and they ll just fairly swarm over you and have a noble good time  
 yes  dey  will i reck n mars tom but what kine er time is  jim  havin  
blest if i kin see de pint 
but i ll do it ef i got to 
i reck n i better keep de animals satisfied en not have no trouble in de house  
tom waited to think it over and see if there wasn t nothing else and pretty soon he says  oh there s one thing i forgot 
could you raise a flower here do you reckon  
 i doan know but maybe i could mars tom but it s tolable dark in heah en i ain got no use f r no flower nohow en she d be a pow ful sight o trouble  
 well you try it anyway 
some other prisoners has done it  
 one er dem big cat tail lookin mullen stalks would grow in heah mars tom i reck n but she wouldn t be wuth half de trouble she d coss  
 don t you believe it 
we ll fetch you a little one and you plant it in the corner over there and raise it 
and don t call it mullen call it pitchiola  that s its right name when it s in a prison 
and you want to water it with your tears  
 why i got plenty spring water mars tom  
 you don t  want  spring water you want to water it with your tears 
it s the way they always do  
 why mars tom i lay i kin raise one er dem mullen stalks twyste wid spring water whiles another man s a  start n  one wid tears  
 that ain t the idea 
you  got  to do it with tears  
 she ll die on my han s mars tom she sholy will kase i doan skasely ever cry  
so tom was stumped 
but he studied it over and then said jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion 
he promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one private in jim s coffee pot in the morning 
jim said he would jis s soon have tobacker in his coffee  and found so much fault with it and with the work and bother of raising the mullen and jews harping the rats and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things on top of all the other work he had to do on pens and inscriptions and journals and things which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook that tom most lost all patience with him and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself and yet he didn t know enough to appreciate them and they was just about wasted on him 
so jim he was sorry and said he wouldn t behave so no more and then me and tom shoved for bed 
chapter xxxix 
in the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat trap and fetched it down and unstopped the best rat hole and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones and then we took it and put it in a safe place under aunt sally s bed 
but while we was gone for spiders little thomas franklin benjamin jefferson elexander phelps found it there and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out and they did and aunt sally she come in and when we got back she was a standing on top of the bed raising cain and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her 
so she took and dusted us both with the hickry and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen drat that meddlesome cub and they warn t the likeliest nuther because the first haul was the pick of the flock 
i never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was 
we got a splendid stock of sorted spiders and bugs and frogs and caterpillars and one thing or another and we like to got a hornet s nest but we didn t 
the family was at home 
we didn t give it right up but stayed with them as long as we could because we allowed we d tire them out or they d got to tire us out and they done it 
then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places and was pretty near all right again but couldn t set down convenient 
and so we went for the snakes and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house snakes and put them in a bag and put it in our room and by that time it was supper time and a rattling good honest day s work and hungry   oh no i reckon not 
and there warn t a blessed snake up there when we went back  we didn t half tie the sack and they worked out somehow and left 
but it didn t matter much because they was still on the premises somewheres 
so we judged we could get some of them again 
no there warn t no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell 
you d see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then and they generly landed in your plate or down the back of your neck and most of the time where you didn t want them 
well they was handsome and striped and there warn t no harm in a million of them but that never made no difference to aunt sally she despised snakes be the breed what they might and she couldn t stand them no way you could fix it and every time one of them flopped down on her it didn t make no difference what she was doing she would just lay that work down and light out 
i never see such a woman 
and you could hear her whoop to jericho 
you couldn t get her to take a holt of one of them with the tongs 
and if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire 
she disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadn t ever been no snakes created 
why after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week aunt sally warn t over it yet she warn t near over it when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings 
it was very curious 
but tom said all women was just so 
he said they was made that way for some reason or other 
we got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way and she allowed these lickings warn t nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them 
i didn t mind the lickings because they didn t amount to nothing but i minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot 
but we got them laid in and all the other things and you never see a cabin as blithesome as jim s was when they d all swarm out for music and go for him 
jim didn t like the spiders and the spiders didn t like jim and so they d lay for him and make it mighty warm for him 
and he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warn t no room in bed for him skasely and when there was a body couldn t sleep it was so lively and it was always lively he said because  they  never all slept at one time but took turn about so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch so he always had one gang under him in his way and t other gang having a circus over him and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over 
he said if he ever got out this time he wouldn t ever be a prisoner again not for a salary 
well by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape 
the shirt was sent in early in a pie and every time a rat bit jim he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh the pens was made the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone the bed leg was sawed in two and we had et up the sawdust and it give us a most amazing stomach ache 
we reckoned we was all going to die but didn t 
it was the most undigestible sawdust i ever see and tom said the same 
but as i was saying we d got all the work done now at last and we was all pretty much fagged out too but mainly jim 
the old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below orleans to come and get their runaway nigger but hadn t got no answer because there warn t no such plantation so he allowed he would advertise jim in the st louis and new orleans papers and when he mentioned the st louis ones it give me the cold shivers and i see we hadn t no time to lose 
so tom said now for the nonnamous letters 
 what s them  
i says 
 warnings to the people that something is up 
sometimes it s done one way sometimes another 
but there s always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle 
when louis xvi 
was going to light out of the tooleries a servant girl done it 
it s a very good way and so is the nonnamous letters 
we ll use them both 
and it s usual for the prisoner s mother to change clothes with him and she stays in and he slides out in her clothes 
we ll do that too  
 but looky here tom what do we want to  warn  anybody for that something s up 
let them find it out for themselves  it s their lookout  
 yes i know but you can t depend on them 
it s the way they ve acted from the very start  left us to do  everything 
they re so confiding and mullet headed they don t take notice of nothing at all 
so if we don t  give  them notice there won t be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape ll go off perfectly flat won t amount to nothing  won t be nothing  to  it  
 well as for me tom that s the way i d like  
 shucks  
he says and looked disgusted 
so i says  but i ain t going to make no complaint 
any way that suits you suits me 
what you going to do about the servant girl  
 you ll be her 
you slide in in the middle of the night and hook that yaller girl s frock  
 why tom that ll make trouble next morning because of course she prob bly hain t got any but that one  
 i know but you don t want it but fifteen minutes to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door  
 all right then i ll do it but i could carry it just as handy in my own togs  
 you wouldn t look like a servant girl  then  would you  
 no but there won t be nobody to see what i look like  anyway  
 that ain t got nothing to do with it 
the thing for us to do is just to do our  duty  and not worry about whether anybody  sees  us do it or not 
hain t you got no principle at all  
 all right i ain t saying nothing i m the servant girl 
who s jim s mother  
 i m his mother 
i ll hook a gown from aunt sally  
 well then you ll have to stay in the cabin when me and jim leaves  
 not much 
i ll stuff jim s clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise and jim ll take the nigger woman s gown off of me and wear it and we ll all evade together 
when a prisoner of style escapes it s called an evasion 
it s always called so when a king escapes f rinstance 
and the same with a king s son it don t make no difference whether he s a natural one or an unnatural one  
so tom he wrote the nonnamous letter and i smouched the yaller wench s frock that night and put it on and shoved it under the front door the way tom told me to 
it said  beware 
trouble is brewing 
keep a sharp lookout 
unknown   friend 
next night we stuck a picture which tom drawed in blood of a skull and crossbones on the front door and next night another one of a coffin on the back door 
i never see a family in such a sweat 
they couldn t a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air 
if a door banged aunt sally she jumped and said ouch  
if anything fell she jumped and said ouch  
if you happened to touch her when she warn t noticing she done the same she couldn t face noway and be satisfied because she allowed there was something behind her every time  so she was always a whirling around sudden and saying ouch  and before she d got two thirds around she d whirl back again and say it again and she was afraid to go to bed but she dasn t set up 
so the thing was working very well tom said he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory 
he said it showed it was done right 
so he said now for the grand bulge 
so the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready and was wondering what we better do with it because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night 
tom he went down the lightning rod to spy around and the nigger at the back door was asleep and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back 
this letter said  don t betray me i wish to be your friend 
there is a desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the indian territory going to steal your runaway nigger to night and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them 
i am one of the gang but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again and will betray the helish design 
they will sneak down from northards along the fence at midnight exact with a false key and go in the nigger s cabin to get him 
i am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if i see any danger but stead of that i will  baa  like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all then whilst they are getting his chains loose you slip there and lock them in and can kill them at your leasure 
don t do anything but just the way i am telling you if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoop jamboreehoo 
i do not wish any reward but to know i have done the right thing 
unknown friend 
chapter xl 
we was feeling pretty good after breakfast and took my canoe and went over the river a fishing with a lunch and had a good time and took a look at the raft and found her all right and got home late to supper and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn t know which end they was standing on and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper and wouldn t tell us what the trouble was and never let on a word about the new letter but didn t need to because we knowed as much about it as anybody did and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed and got up about half past eleven and tom put on aunt sally s dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch but says  where s the butter  
 i laid out a hunk of it  i says on a piece of a corn pone  
 well you  left  it laid out then  it ain t here  
 we can get along without it  i says 
 we can get along  with  it too  he says just you slide down cellar and fetch it 
and then mosey right down the lightning rod and come along 
i ll go and stuff the straw into jim s clothes to represent his mother in disguise and be ready to  baa  like a sheep and shove soon as you get there  
so out he went and down cellar went i 
the hunk of butter big as a person s fist was where i had left it so i took up the slab of corn pone with it on and blowed out my light and started up stairs very stealthy and got up to the main floor all right but here comes aunt sally with a candle and i clapped the truck in my hat and clapped my hat on my head and the next second she see me and she says  you been down cellar  
 yes m  
 what you been doing down there  
 noth n  
 noth n 
 no m  
 well then what possessed you to go down there this time of night  
 i don t know m  
 you don t  know 
don t answer me that way 
tom i want to know what you been  doing  down there  
 i hain t been doing a single thing aunt sally i hope to gracious if i have  
i reckoned she d let me go now and as a generl thing she would but i s pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that warn t yard stick straight so she says very decided  you just march into that setting room and stay there till i come 
you been up to something you no business to and i lay i ll find out what it is before i m done with you  
so she went away as i opened the door and walked into the setting room 
my but there was a crowd there 
fifteen farmers and every one of them had a gun 
i was most powerful sick and slunk to a chair and set down 
they was setting around some of them talking a little in a low voice and all of them fidgety and uneasy but trying to look like they warn t but i knowed they was because they was always taking off their hats and putting them on and scratching their heads and changing their seats and fumbling with their buttons 
i warn t easy myself but i didn t take my hat off all the same 
i did wish aunt sally would come and get done with me and lick me if she wanted to and let me get away and tell tom how we d overdone this thing and what a thundering hornet s nest we d got ourselves into so we could stop fooling around straight off and clear out with jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us 
at last she come and begun to ask me questions but i  couldn t  answer them straight i didn t know which end of me was up because these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right now and lay for them desperadoes and saying it warn t but a few minutes to midnight and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep signal and here was aunty pegging away at the questions and me a shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks i was that scared and the place getting hotter and hotter and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears and pretty soon when one of them says i m for going and getting in the cabin first  and right  now  and catching them when they come  i most dropped and a streak of butter come a trickling down my forehead and aunt sally she see it and turns white as a sheet and says  for the land s sake what  is  the matter with the child 
he s got the brain fever as shore as you re born and they re oozing out  
and everybody runs to see and she snatches off my hat and out comes the bread and what was left of the butter and she grabbed me and hugged me and says  oh what a turn you did give me 
and how glad and grateful i am it ain t no worse for luck s against us and it never rains but it pours and when i see that truck i thought we d lost you for i knowed by the color and all it was just like your brains would be if  dear dear whyd nt you  tell  me that was what you d been down there for i wouldn t a cared 
now cler out to bed and don t lemme see no more of you till morning  
i was up stairs in a second and down the lightning rod in another one and shinning through the dark for the lean to 
i couldn t hardly get my words out i was so anxious but i told tom as quick as i could we must jump for it now and not a minute to lose  the house full of men yonder with guns 
his eyes just blazed and he says  no   is that so 
ain t  it bully 
why huck if it was to do over again i bet i could fetch two hundred 
if we could put it off till    hurry 
hurry  
i says 
 where s jim  
 right at your elbow if you reach out your arm you can touch him 
he s dressed and everything s ready 
now we ll slide out and give the sheep signal  
but then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door and heard them begin to fumble with the pad lock and heard a man say  i  told  you we d be too soon they haven t come  the door is locked 
here i ll lock some of you into the cabin and you lay for em in the dark and kill em when they come and the rest scatter around a piece and listen if you can hear em coming  
so in they come but couldn t see us in the dark and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed 
but we got under all right and out through the hole swift but soft  jim first me next and tom last which was according to tom s orders 
now we was in the lean to and heard trampings close by outside 
so we crept to the door and tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack but couldn t make out nothing it was so dark and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further and when he nudged us jim must glide out first and him last 
so he set his ear to the crack and listened and listened and listened and the steps a scraping around out there all the time and at last he nudged us and we slid out and stooped down not breathing and not making the least noise and slipped stealthy towards the fence in injun file and got to it all right and me and jim over it but tom s britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail and then he hear the steps coming so he had to pull loose which snapped the splinter and made a noise and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out  who s that 
answer or i ll shoot  
but we didn t answer we just unfurled our heels and shoved 
then there was a rush and a  bang bang bang 
and the bullets fairly whizzed around us 
we heard them sing out  here they are 
they ve broke for the river 
after em boys and turn loose the dogs  
so here they come full tilt 
we could hear them because they wore boots and yelled but we didn t wear no boots and didn t yell 
we was in the path to the mill and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by and then dropped in behind them 
they d had all the dogs shut up so they wouldn t scare off the robbers but by this time somebody had let them loose and here they come making powwow enough for a million but they was our dogs so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up and when they see it warn t nobody but us and no excitement to offer them they only just said howdy and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering and then we up steam again and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river but didn t make no more noise than we was obleeged to 
then we struck out easy and comfortable for the island where my raft was and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out 
and when we stepped on to the raft i says   now  old jim you re a free man again and i bet you won t ever be a slave no more  
 en a mighty good job it wuz too huck 
it uz planned beautiful en it uz done beautiful en dey ain t  nobody  kin git up a plan dat s mo mixed up en splendid den what dat one wuz  
we was all glad as we could be but tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg 
when me and jim heard that we didn t feel so brash as what we did before 
it was hurting him considerable and bleeding so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke s shirts for to bandage him but he says  gimme the rags i can do it myself 
don t stop now don t fool around here and the evasion booming along so handsome man the sweeps and set her loose 
boys we done it elegant    deed we did 
i wish  we d  a had the handling of louis xvi  there wouldn t a been no son of saint louis ascend to heaven  
wrote down in  his  biography no sir we d a whooped him over the  border  that s what we d a done with  him  and done it just as slick as nothing at all too 
man the sweeps  man the sweeps  
but me and jim was consulting  and thinking 
and after we d thought a minute i says  say it jim  
so he says  well den dis is de way it look to me huck 
ef it wuz  him  dat uz bein sot free en one er de boys wuz to git shot would he say go on en save me nemmine bout a doctor f r to save dis one  
is dat like mars tom sawyer 
would he say dat 
you  bet  he wouldn t 
well  den is  jim  gywne to say it 
no sah  i doan budge a step out n dis place dout a  doctor  not if it s forty year  
i knowed he was white inside and i reckoned he d say what he did say  so it was all right now and i told tom i was a going for a doctor 
he raised considerable row about it but me and jim stuck to it and wouldn t budge so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself but we wouldn t let him 
then he give us a piece of his mind but it didn t do no good 
so when he sees me getting the canoe ready he says  well then if you re bound to go i ll tell you the way to do when you get to the village 
shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast and make him swear to be silent as the grave and put a purse full of gold in his hand and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark and then fetch him here in the canoe in a roundabout way amongst the islands and search him and take his chalk away from him and don t give it back to him till you get him back to the village or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again 
it s the way they all do  
so i said i would and left and jim was to hide in the woods when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again 
chapter xli 
the doctor was an old man a very nice kind looking old man when i got him up 
i told him me and my brother was over on spanish island hunting yesterday afternoon and camped on a piece of a raft we found and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams for it went off and shot him in the leg and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it nor let anybody know because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks 
 who is your folks  
he says 
 the phelpses down yonder  
 oh  he says 
and after a minute he says  how d you say he got shot  
 he had a dream  i says and it shot him  
 singular dream  he says 
so he lit up his lantern and got his saddle bags and we started 
but when he sees the canoe he didn t like the look of her  said she was big enough for one but didn t look pretty safe for two 
i says  oh you needn t be afeard sir she carried the three of us easy enough  
 what three  
 why me and sid and  and  and  the guns  that s what i mean  
 oh  he says 
but he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her and shook his head and said he reckoned he d look around for a bigger one 
but they was all locked and chained so he took my canoe and said for me to wait till he come back or i could hunt around further or maybe i better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if i wanted to 
but i said i didn t so i told him just how to find the raft and then he started 
i struck an idea pretty soon 
i says to myself spos n he can t fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep s tail as the saying is 
spos n it takes him three or four days 
what are we going to do   lay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag 
no sir i know what i ll  do 
i ll wait and when he comes back if he says he s got to go any more i ll get down there too if i swim and we ll take and tie him and keep him and shove out down the river and when tom s done with him we ll give him what it s worth or all we got and then let him get ashore 
so then i crept into a lumber pile to get some sleep and next time i waked up the sun was away up over my head 
i shot out and went for the doctor s house but they told me he d gone away in the night some time or other and warn t back yet 
well thinks i that looks powerful bad for tom and i ll dig out for the island right off 
so away i shoved and turned the corner and nearly rammed my head into uncle silas s stomach 
he says  why  tom 
where you been all this time you rascal  
 i hain t been nowheres  i says only just hunting for the runaway nigger  me and sid  
 why where ever did you go  
he says 
 your aunt s been mighty uneasy  
 she needn t  i says because we was all right 
we followed the men and the dogs but they outrun us and we lost them but we thought we heard them on the water so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over but couldn t find nothing of them so we cruised along up shore till we got kind of tired and beat out and tied up the canoe and went to sleep and never waked up till about an hour ago then we paddled over here to hear the news and sid s at the post office to see what he can hear and i m a branching out to get something to eat for us and then we re going home  
so then we went to the post office to get sid  but just as i suspicioned he warn t there so the old man he got a letter out of the office and we waited awhile longer but sid didn t come so the old man said come along let sid foot it home or canoe it when he got done fooling around  but we would ride 
i couldn t get him to let me stay and wait for sid and he said there warn t no use in it and i must come along and let aunt sally see we was all right 
when we got home aunt sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both and hugged me and give me one of them lickings of hern that don t amount to shucks and said she d serve sid the same when he come 
and the place was plum full of farmers and farmers wives to dinner and such another clack a body never heard 
old mrs hotchkiss was the worst her tongue was a going all the time 
she says  well sister phelps i ve ransacked that air cabin over an i b lieve the nigger was crazy

i says to sister dunlap s i    why dog my cats they must a ben a house full o niggers in there every night for four weeks to a done all that work sister phelps 
look at that shirt  every last inch of it kivered over with secret african writ n done with blood 
must a ben a raft uv m at it right along all the time amost 
why i d give two dollars to have it read to me n as for the niggers that wrote it i low i d take n lash m t ll    people to  help  him brother marples 
well i reckon you d  think  so if you d a been in this house for a while back 
why they ve stole everything they could lay their hands on  and we a watching all the time mind you 
they stole that shirt right off o the line 
and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of ther ain t no telling how many times they  didn t  steal that and flour and candles and candlesticks and spoons and the old warming pan and most a thousand things that i disremember now and my new calico dress and me and silas and my sid and tom on the constant watch day  and  night as i was a telling you and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them and here at the last minute lo and behold you they slides right in under our noses and fools us and not only fools  us  but the injun territory robbers too and actuly gets  away  with that nigger safe and sound and that with sixteen men and twenty two dogs right on their very heels at that very time 
i tell you it just bangs anything i ever  heard  of 
why  sperits  couldn t a done better and been no smarter 
and i reckon they must a  been  sperits  because  you  know our dogs and ther ain t no better well them dogs never even got on the  track  of m once 
you explain  that  to me if you can   any  of you  
 well it does beat    laws alive i never    so help me i wouldn t a be     house thieves as well as    goodnessgracioussakes i d a ben afeard to live in sich a     fraid to  live   why i was that scared i dasn t hardly go to bed or get up or lay down or  set  down sister ridgeway 
why they d steal the very  why goodness sakes you can guess what kind of a fluster i was in by the time midnight come last night 
i hope to gracious if i warn t afraid they d steal some o the family 
i was just to that pass i didn t have no reasoning faculties no more 
it looks foolish enough now  in the daytime but i says to myself there s my two poor boys asleep way up stairs in that lonesome room and i declare to goodness i was that uneasy t i crep up there and locked em in 
i  did 
and anybody would 
because you know when you get scared that way and it keeps running on and getting worse and worse all the time and your wits gets to addling and you get to doing all sorts o wild things and by and by you think to yourself spos n i was a boy and was away up there and the door ain t locked and you   she stopped looking kind of wondering and then she turned her head around slow and when her eye lit on me  i got up and took a walk 
says i to myself i can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if i go out to one side and study over it a little 
so i done it 
but i dasn t go fur or she d a sent for me 
and when it was late in the day the people all went and then i come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and sid  and the door was locked and we wanted to see the fun so we went down the lightning rod and both of us got hurt a little and we didn t never want to try  that  no more 
and then i went on and told her all what i told uncle silas before and then she said she d forgive us and maybe it was all right enough anyway and about what a body might expect of boys for all boys was a pretty harum scarum lot as fur as she could see and so as long as no harm hadn t come of it she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still stead of fretting over what was past and done 
so then she kissed me and patted me on the head and dropped into a kind of a brown study and pretty soon jumps up and says  why lawsamercy it s most night and sid not come yet 
what  has  become of that boy  
i see my chance so i skips up and says  i ll run right up to town and get him  i says 
 no you won t  she says 
 you ll stay right wher you are  one s  enough to be lost at a time 
if he ain t here to supper your uncle ll go  
well he warn t there to supper so right after supper uncle went 
he come back about ten a little bit uneasy hadn t run across tom s track 
aunt sally was a good  deal  uneasy but uncle silas he said there warn t no occasion to be  boys will be boys he said and you ll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right 
so she had to be satisfied 
but she said she d set up for him a while anyway and keep a light burning so he could see it 
and then when i went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle and tucked me in and mothered me so good i felt mean and like i couldn t look her in the face and she set down on the bed and talked with me a long time and said what a splendid boy sid was and didn t seem to want to ever stop talking about him and kept asking me every now and then if i reckoned he could a got lost or hurt or maybe drownded and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead and she not by him to help him and so the tears would drip down silent and i would tell her that sid was all right and would be home in the morning sure and she would squeeze my hand or maybe kiss me and tell me to say it again and keep on saying it because it done her good and she was in so much trouble 
and when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle and says  the door ain t going to be locked tom and there s the window and the rod but you ll be good  won t  you 
and you won t go 
for  my  sake  
laws knows i  wanted  to go bad enough to see about tom and was all intending to go but after that i wouldn t a went not for kingdoms 
but she was on my mind and tom was on my mind so i slept very restless 
and twice i went down the rod away in the night and slipped around front and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes towards the road and the tears in them and i wished i could do something for her but i couldn t only to swear that i wouldn t never do nothing to grieve her any more 
and the third time i waked up at dawn and slid down and she was there yet and her candle was most out and her old gray head was resting on her hand and she was asleep 
chapter xlii 
the old man was uptown again before breakfast but couldn t get no track of tom and both of them set at the table thinking and not saying nothing and looking mournful and their coffee getting cold and not eating anything 
and by and by the old man says  did i give you the letter  
 what letter  
 the one i got yesterday out of the post office  
 no you didn t give me no letter  
 well i must a forgot it  
so he rummaged his pockets and then went off somewheres where he had laid it down and fetched it and give it to her 
she says  why it s from st petersburg  it s from sis  
i allowed another walk would do me good but i couldn t stir 
but before she could break it open she dropped it and run  for she see something 
and so did i 
it was tom sawyer on a mattress and that old doctor and jim in  her  calico dress with his hands tied behind him and a lot of people 
i hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy and rushed 
she flung herself at tom crying and says  oh he s dead he s dead i know he s dead  
and tom he turned his head a little and muttered something or other which showed he warn t in his right mind then she flung up her hands and says  he s alive thank god 
and that s enough  
and she snatched a kiss of him and flew for the house to get the bed ready and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody else as fast as her tongue could go every jump of the way 
i followed the men to see what they was going to do with jim and the old doctor and uncle silas followed after tom into the house 
the men was very huffy and some of them wanted to hang jim for an example to all the other niggers around there so they wouldn t be trying to run away like jim done and making such a raft of trouble and keeping a whole family scared most to death for days and nights 
but the others said don t do it it wouldn t answer at all he ain t our nigger and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him sure 
so that cooled them down a little because the people that s always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hain t done just right is always the very ones that ain t the most anxious to pay for him when they ve got their satisfaction out of him 
they cussed jim considerble though and give him a cuff or two side the head once in a while but jim never said nothing and he never let on to know me and they took him to the same cabin and put his own clothes on him and chained him again and not to no bed leg this time but to a big staple drove into the bottom log and chained his hands too and both legs and said he warn t to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come or he was sold at auction because he didn t come in a certain length of time and filled up our hole and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl good bye cussing and then the old doctor comes and takes a look and says  don t be no rougher on him than you re obleeged to because he ain t a bad nigger 
when i got to where i found the boy i see i couldn t cut the bullet out without some help and he warn t in no condition for me to leave to go and get help and he got a little worse and a little worse and after a long time he went out of his head and wouldn t let me come a nigh him any more and said if i chalked his raft he d kill me and no end of wild foolishness like that and i see i couldn t do anything at all with him so i says i got to have  help  somehow and the minute i says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he ll help and he done it too and done it very well 
of course i judged he must be a runaway nigger and there i  was 
and there i had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night 
it was a fix i tell you 
i had a couple of patients with the chills and of course i d of liked to run up to town and see them but i dasn t because the nigger might get away and then i d be to blame and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail 
so there i had to stick plumb until daylight this morning and i never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller and yet he was risking his freedom to do it and was all tired out too and i see plain enough he d been worked main hard lately 
i liked the nigger for that i tell you gentlemen a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars  and kind treatment too 
i had everything i needed and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home  better maybe because it was so quiet but there i was  with both of m on my hands and there i had to stick till about dawn this morning then some men in a skiff come by and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep so i motioned them in quiet and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about and we never had no trouble 
and the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep too we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on and towed her over very nice and quiet and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start 
he ain t no bad nigger gentlemen that s what i think about him  
somebody says  well it sounds very good doctor i m obleeged to say  
then the others softened up a little too and i was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing jim that good turn and i was glad it was according to my judgment of him too because i thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time i see him 
then they all agreed that jim had acted very well and was deserving to have some notice took of it and reward 
so every one of them promised right out and hearty that they wouldn t cuss him no more 
then they come out and locked him up 
i hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off because they was rotten heavy or could have meat and greens with his bread and water but they didn t think of it and i reckoned it warn t best for me to mix in but i judged i d get the doctor s yarn to aunt sally somehow or other as soon as i d got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me  explanations i mean of how i forgot to mention about sid being shot when i was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger 
but i had plenty time 
aunt sally she stuck to the sick room all day and all night and every time i see uncle silas mooning around i dodged him 
next morning i heard tom was a good deal better and they said aunt sally was gone to get a nap 
so i slips to the sick room and if i found him awake i reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash 
but he was sleeping and sleeping very peaceful too and pale not fire faced the way he was when he come 
so i set down and laid for him to wake 
in about half an hour aunt sally comes gliding in and there i was up a stump again 
she motioned me to be still and set down by me and begun to whisper and said we could all be joyful now because all the symptoms was first rate and he d been sleeping like that for ever so long and looking better and peacefuller all the time and ten to one he d wake up in his right mind 
so we set there watching and by and by he stirs a bit and opened his eyes very natural and takes a look and says  hello   why i m at  home 
how s that 
where s the raft  
 it s all right  i says 
 and  jim  
 the same  i says but couldn t say it pretty brash 
but he never noticed but says  good 
splendid 
now  we re all right and safe 
did you tell aunty  
i was going to say yes but she chipped in and says  about what sid  
 why about the way the whole thing was done  
 what whole thing  
 why  the  whole thing 
there ain t but one how we set the runaway nigger free  me and tom  
 good land 
set the run  what  is  the child talking about 
dear dear out of his head again  
 no  i ain t out of my  head  i know all what i m talking about 
we did  set him free  me and tom 
we laid out to do it and we  done  it 
and we done it elegant too  
he d got a start and she never checked him up just set and stared and stared and let him clip along and i see it warn t no use for  me  to put in 
 why aunty it cost us a power of work  weeks of it  hours and hours every night whilst you was all asleep 
and we had to steal candles and the sheet and the shirt and your dress and spoons and tin plates and case knives and the warming pan and the grindstone and flour and just no end of things and you can t think what work it was to make the saws and pens and inscriptions and one thing or another and you can t think  half  the fun it was 
and we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things and nonnamous letters from the robbers and get up and down the lightning rod and dig the hole into the cabin and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket    mercy sakes  
   and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on for company for jim and then you kept tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business because the men come before we was out of the cabin and we had to rush and they heard us and let drive at us and i got my share and we dodged out of the path and let them go by and when the dogs come they warn t interested in us but went for the most noise and we got our canoe and made for the raft and was all safe and jim was a free man and we done it all by ourselves and  wasn t  it bully aunty  
 well i never heard the likes of it in all my born days 
so it was you  you little rapscallions that s been making all this trouble and turned everybody s wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death 
i ve as good a notion as ever i had in my life to take it out o you this very minute 
to think here i ve been night after night a  you  just get well once you young scamp and i lay i ll tan the old harry out o both o ye  
but tom he  was  so proud and joyful he just  couldn t  hold in and his tongue just  went  it  she a chipping in and spitting fire all along and both of them going it at once like a cat convention and she says   well  you get all the enjoyment you can out of it  now  for mind i tell you if i catch you meddling with him again    meddling with  who  
tom says dropping his smile and looking surprised 
 with  who 
why the runaway nigger of course 
who d you reckon  
tom looks at me very grave and says  tom didn t you just tell me he was all right 
hasn t he got away  
 him  
says aunt sally the runaway nigger 
 deed he hasn t 
they ve got him back safe and sound and he s in that cabin again on bread and water and loaded down with chains till he s claimed or sold  
tom rose square up in bed with his eye hot and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills and sings out to me  they hain t no  right  to shut him up 
shove   and don t you lose a minute 
turn him loose 
he ain t no slave he s as free as any cretur that walks this earth  
 what  does  the child mean  
 i mean every word i  say  aunt sally and if somebody don t go  i ll  go 
i ve knowed him all his life and so has tom there 
old miss watson died two months ago and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river and  said  so and she set him free in her will  
 then what on earth did  you  want to set him free for seeing he was already free  
 well that  is  a question i must say and just like women 
why i wanted the  adventure  of it and i d a waded neck deep in blood to  goodness alive  aunt polly 
if she warn t standing right there just inside the door looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie i wish i may never 
aunt sally jumped for her and most hugged the head off of her and cried over her and i found a good enough place for me under the bed for it was getting pretty sultry for us seemed to me 
and i peeped out and in a little while tom s aunt polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at tom over her spectacles  kind of grinding him into the earth you know 
and then she says  yes you  better  turn y r head away  i would if i was you tom  
 oh deary me  
says aunt sally  is  he changed so 
why that ain t tom  it s sid tom s  tom s  why where is tom 
he was here a minute ago  
 you mean where s huck  finn  that s what you mean 
i reckon i hain t raised such a scamp as my tom all these years not to know him when i see  him 
that  would  be a pretty howdy do 
come out from under that bed huck finn  
so i done it 
but not feeling brash 
aunt sally she was one of the mixed upest looking persons i ever see  except one and that was uncle silas when he come in and they told it all to him 
it kind of made him drunk as you may say and he didn t know nothing at all the rest of the day and preached a prayer meeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation because the oldest man in the world couldn t a understood it 
so tom s aunt polly she told all about who i was and what and i had to up and tell how i was in such a tight place that when mrs phelps took me for tom sawyer  she chipped in and says oh go on and call me aunt sally i m used to it now and tain t no need to change   that when aunt sally took me for tom sawyer i had to stand it  there warn t no other way and i knowed he wouldn t mind because it would be nuts for him being a mystery and he d make an adventure out of it and be perfectly satisfied 
and so it turned out and he let on to be sid and made things as soft as he could for me 
and his aunt polly she said tom was right about old miss watson setting jim free in her will and so sure enough tom sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free 
and i couldn t ever understand before until that minute and that talk how he  could  help a body set a nigger free with his bringing up 
well aunt polly she said that when aunt sally wrote to her that tom and sid  had come all right and safe she says to herself  look at that now 
i might have expected it letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him 
so now i got to go and trapse all the way down the river eleven hundred mile and find out what that creetur s up to  this  time as long as i couldn t seem to get any answer out of you about it  
 why i never heard nothing from you  says aunt sally 
 well i wonder 
why i wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by sid being here  
 well i never got em sis  
aunt polly she turns around slow and severe and says  you tom  
 well  what  
he says kind of pettish 
 don t you what  me  you impudent thing  hand out them letters  
 what letters  
 them  letters 
i be bound if i have to take a holt of you i ll    they re in the trunk 
there now 
and they re just the same as they was when i got them out of the office 
i hain t looked into them i hain t touched them 
but i knowed they d make trouble and i thought if you warn t in no hurry i d    well you  do  need skinning there ain t no mistake about it 
and i wrote another one to tell you i was coming and i s pose he    no it come yesterday i hain t read it yet but  it s  all right i ve got that one  
i wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn t but i reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to 
so i never said nothing 
chapter the last  the first time i catched tom private i asked him what was his idea time of the evasion   what it was he d planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before 
and he said what he had planned in his head from the start if we got jim out all safe was for us to run him down the river on the raft and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river and then tell him about his being free and take him back up home on a steamboat in style and pay him for his lost time and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass band and then he would be a hero and so would we 
but i reckoned it was about as well the way it was 
we had jim out of the chains in no time and when aunt polly and uncle silas and aunt sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse tom they made a heap of fuss over him and fixed him up prime and give him all he wanted to eat and a good time and nothing to do 
and we had him up to the sick room and had a high talk and tom give jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient and doing it up so good and jim was pleased most to death and busted out and says  dah now huck what i tell you   what i tell you up dah on jackson islan  
i  tole  you i got a hairy breas  en what s de sign un it en i  tole  you i ben rich wunst en gwineter to be rich  agin  en it s come true en heah she is 
dah  now 
doan talk to  me  signs is signs  mine i tell you en i knowed jis s well at i uz gwineter be rich agin as i s a stannin heah dis minute  
and then tom he talked along and talked along and says le s all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit and go for howling adventures amongst the injuns over in the territory for a couple of weeks or two and i says all right that suits me but i ain t got no money for to buy the outfit and i reckon i couldn t get none from home because it s likely pap s been back before now and got it all away from judge thatcher and drunk it up 
 no he hain t  tom says it s all there yet  six thousand dollars and more and your pap hain t ever been back since 
hadn t when i come away anyhow  
jim says kind of solemn  he ain t a comin back no mo  huck  
i says  why jim  
 nemmine why huck  but he ain t comin back no mo  
but i kept at him so at last he says  doan you member de house dat was float n down de river en dey wuz a man in dah kivered up en i went in en unkivered him and didn let you come in 
well den you kin git yo money when you wants it kase dat wuz him  
tom s most well now and got his bullet around his neck on a watch guard for a watch and is always seeing what time it is and so there ain t nothing more to write about and i am rotten glad of it because if i d a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book i wouldn t a tackled it and ain t a going to no more 
but i reckon i got to light out for the territory ahead of the rest because aunt sally she s going to adopt me and sivilize me and i can t stand it 
i been there before
