he jumped up at the doctor s voice took his hands from his face and saw alexey alexandrovitch 
seeing the husband he was so overwhelmed that he sat down again drawing his head down to his shoulders as if he wanted to disappear but he made an effort over himself got up and said  she is dying 
the doctors say there is no hope 
i am entirely in your power only let me be here   though i am at your disposal 
i     alexey alexandrovitch seeing vronsky s tears felt a rush of that nervous emotion always produced in him by the sight of other people s suffering and turning away his face he moved hurriedly to the door without hearing the rest of his words 
from the bedroom came the sound of anna s voice saying something 
her voice was lively eager with exceedingly distinct intonations 
alexey alexandrovitch went into the bedroom and went up to the bed 
she was lying turned with her face towards him 
her cheeks were flushed crimson her eyes glittered her little white hands thrust out from the sleeves of her dressing gown were playing with the quilt twisting it about 
it seemed as though she were not only well and blooming but in the happiest frame of mind 
she was talking rapidly musically and with exceptionally correct articulation and expressive intonation 
 for alexey  i am speaking of alexey alexandrovitch what a strange and awful thing that both are alexey isn t it  
  alexey would not refuse me 
i should forget he would forgive    
but why doesn t he come 
he s so good he doesn t know himself how good he is 
ah my god what agony 
give me some water quick 
oh that will be bad for her my little girl 
oh very well then give her to a nurse 
yes i agree it s better in fact 
he ll be coming it will hurt him to see her 
give her to the nurse  
 anna arkadyevna he has come 
here he is  
said the midwife trying to attract her attention to alexey alexandrovitch 
 oh what nonsense  
anna went on not seeing her husband 
 no give her to me give me my little one 
he has not come yet 
you say he won t forgive me because you don t know him 
no one knows him 
i m the only one and it was hard for me even 
his eyes i ought to know  seryozha has just the same eyes  and i can t bear to see them because of it 
has seryozha had his dinner 
i know everyone will forget him 
he would not forget 
seryozha must be moved into the corner room and mariette must be asked to sleep with him  
all of a sudden she shrank back was silent and in terror as though expecting a blow as though to defend herself she raised her hands to her face 
she had seen her husband 
 no no  
she began 
 i am not afraid of him i am afraid of death 
alexey come here 
i am in a hurry because i ve no time i ve not long left to live the fever will begin directly and i shall understand nothing more 
now i understand i understand it all i see it all  
alexey alexandrovitch s wrinkled face wore an expression of agony he took her by the hand and tried to say something but he could not utter it his lower lip quivered but he still went on struggling with his emotion and only now and then glanced at her 
and each time he glanced at her he saw her eyes gazing at him with such passionate and triumphant tenderness as he had never seen in them 
 wait a minute you don t know   stay a little stay     
she stopped as though collecting her ideas 
 yes  she began yes yes yes 
this is what i wanted to say 
don t be surprised at me 
i m still the same    
but there is another woman in me i m afraid of her she loved that man and i tried to hate you and could not forget about her that used to be 
i m not that woman 
now i m my real self all myself 
i m dying now i know i shall die ask him 
even now i feel  see here the weights on my feet on my hands on my fingers 
my fingers  see how huge they are 
but this will soon all be over     only one thing i want forgive me forgive me quite 
i m terrible but my nurse used to tell me the holy martyr  what was her name 
she was worse 
and i ll go to rome there s a wilderness and there i shall be no trouble to any one only i ll take seryozha and the little one     no you can t forgive me 
i know it can t be forgiven 
no no go away you re too good  
she held his hand in one burning hand while she pushed him away with the other 
the nervous agitation of alexey alexandrovitch kept increasing and had by now reached such a point that he ceased to struggle with it 
he suddenly felt that what he had regarded as nervous agitation was on the contrary a blissful spiritual condition that gave him all at once a new happiness he had never known 
he did not think that the christian law that he had been all his life trying to follow enjoined on him to forgive and love his enemies but a glad feeling of love and forgiveness for his enemies filled his heart 
he knelt down and laying his head in the curve of her arm which burned him as with fire through the sleeve he sobbed like a little child 
she put her arm around his head moved towards him and with defiant pride lifted up her eyes 
 that is he 
i knew him 
now forgive me everyone forgive me    
they ve come again why don t they go away    
oh take these cloaks off me  
the doctor unloosed her hands carefully laying her on the pillow and covered her up to the shoulders 
she lay back submissively and looked before her with beaming eyes 
 remember one thing that i needed nothing but forgiveness and i want nothing more     why doesn t  he  come  
she said turning to the door towards vronsky 
 do come do come 
give him your hand  
vronsky came to the side of the bed and seeing anna again hid his face in his hands 
 uncover your face  look at him 
he s a saint  she said 
 oh 
uncover your face do uncover it  
she said angrily 
 alexey alexandrovitch do uncover his face 
i want to see him  
alexey alexandrovitch took vronsky s hands and drew them away from his face which was awful with the expression of agony and shame upon it 
 give him your hand 
forgive him  
alexey alexandrovitch gave him his hand not attempting to restrain the tears that streamed from his eyes 
 thank god thank god  
she said now everything is ready 
only to stretch my legs a little 
there that s capital 
how badly these flowers are done  not a bit like a violet  she said pointing to the hangings 
 my god my god 
when will it end 
give me some morphine 
doctor give me some morphine 
oh my god my god  
and she tossed about on the bed 
the doctors said that it was puerperal fever and that it was ninety nine chances in a hundred it would end in death 
the whole day long there was fever delirium and unconsciousness 
at midnight the patient lay without consciousness and almost without pulse 
the end was expected every minute 
vronsky had gone home but in the morning he came to inquire and alexey alexandrovitch meeting him in the hall said better stay she might ask for you  and himself led him to his wife s boudoir 
towards morning there was a return again of excitement rapid thought and talk and again it ended in unconsciousness 
on the third day it was the same thing and the doctors said there was hope 
that day alexey alexandrovitch went into the boudoir where vronsky was sitting and closing the door sat down opposite him 
 alexey alexandrovitch  said vronsky feeling that a statement of the position was coming i can t speak i can t understand 
spare me 
however hard it is for you believe me it is more terrible for me  
he would have risen but alexey alexandrovitch took him by the hand and said  i beg you to hear me out it is necessary 
i must explain my feelings the feelings that have guided me and will guide me so that you may not be in error regarding me 
you know i had resolved on a divorce and had even begun to take proceedings 
i won t conceal from you that in beginning this i was in uncertainty i was in misery i will confess that i was pursued by a desire to revenge myself on you and on her 
when i got the telegram i came here with the same feelings i will say more i longed for her death 
but      he paused pondering whether to disclose or not to disclose his feeling to him 
 but i saw her and forgave her 
and the happiness of forgiveness has revealed to me my duty 
i forgive completely 
i would offer the other cheek i would give my cloak if my coat be taken 
i pray to god only not to take from me the bliss of forgiveness  
tears stood in his eyes and the luminous serene look in them impressed vronsky 
 this is my position you can trample me in the mud make me the laughing stock of the world i will not abandon her and i will never utter a word of reproach to you  alexey alexandrovitch went on 
 my duty is clearly marked for me i ought to be with her and i will be 
if she wishes to see you i will let you know but now i suppose it would be better for you to go away  
he got up and sobs cut short his words 
vronsky too was getting up and in a stooping not yet erect posture looked up at him from under his brows 
he did not understand alexey alexandrovitch s feeling but he felt that it was something higher and even unattainable for him with his view of life 
chapter    after the conversation with alexey alexandrovitch vronsky went out onto the steps of the karenins house and stood still with difficulty remembering where he was and where he ought to walk or drive 
he felt disgraced humiliated guilty and deprived of all possibility of washing away his humiliation 
he felt thrust out of the beaten track along which he had so proudly and lightly walked till then 
all the habits and rules of his life that had seemed so firm had turned out suddenly false and inapplicable 
the betrayed husband who had figured till that time as a pitiful creature an incidental and somewhat ludicrous obstacle to his happiness had suddenly been summoned by her herself elevated to an awe inspiring pinnacle and on the pinnacle that husband had shown himself not malignant not false not ludicrous but kind and straightforward and large 
vronsky could not but feel this and the parts were suddenly reversed 
vronsky felt his elevation and his own abasement his truth and his own falsehood 
he felt that the husband was magnanimous even in his sorrow while he had been base and petty in his deceit 
but this sense of his own humiliation before the man he had unjustly despised made up only a small part of his misery 
he felt unutterably wretched now for his passion for anna which had seemed to him of late to be growing cooler now that he knew he had lost her forever was stronger than ever it had been 
he had seen all of her in her illness had come to know her very soul and it seemed to him that he had never loved her till then 
and now when he had learned to know her to love her as she should be loved he had been humiliated before her and had lost her forever leaving with her nothing of himself but a shameful memory 
most terrible of all had been his ludicrous shameful position when alexey alexandrovitch had pulled his hands away from his humiliated face 
he stood on the steps of the karenins house like one distraught and did not know what to do 
 a sledge sir  
asked the porter 
 yes a sledge  
on getting home after three sleepless nights vronsky without undressing lay down flat on the sofa clasping his hands and laying his head on them 
his head was heavy 
images memories and ideas of the strangest description followed one another with extraordinary rapidity and vividness 
first it was the medicine he had poured out for the patient and spilt over the spoon then the midwife s white hands then the queer posture of alexey alexandrovitch on the floor beside the bed 
 to sleep 
to forget  
he said to himself with the serene confidence of a healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy he will go to sleep at once 
and the same instant his head did begin to feel drowsy and he began to drop off into forgetfulness 
the waves of the sea of unconsciousness had begun to meet over his head when all at once  it was as though a violent shock of electricity had passed over him 
he started so that he leaped up on the springs of the sofa and leaning on his arms got in a panic onto his knees 
his eyes were wide open as though he had never been asleep 
the heaviness in his head and the weariness in his limbs that he had felt a minute before had suddenly gone 
 you may trample me in the mud  he heard alexey alexandrovitch s words and saw him standing before him and saw anna s face with its burning flush and glittering eyes gazing with love and tenderness not at him but at alexey alexandrovitch he saw his own as he fancied foolish and ludicrous figure when alexey alexandrovitch took his hands away from his face 
he stretched out his legs again and flung himself on the sofa in the same position and shut his eyes 
 to sleep 
to forget  
he repeated to himself 
but with his eyes shut he saw more distinctly than ever anna s face as it had been on the memorable evening before the races 
 that is not and will not be and she wants to wipe it out of her memory 
but i cannot live without it 
how can we be reconciled 
how can we be reconciled  
he said aloud and unconsciously began to repeat these words 
this repetition checked the rising up of fresh images and memories which he felt were thronging in his brain 
but repeating words did not check his imagination for long 
again in extraordinarily rapid succession his best moments rose before his mind and then his recent humiliation 
 take away his hands  anna s voice says 
he takes away his hands and feels the shamestruck and idiotic expression of his face 
he still lay down trying to sleep though he felt there was not the smallest hope of it and kept repeating stray words from some chain of thought trying by this to check the rising flood of fresh images 
he listened and heard in a strange mad whisper words repeated i did not appreciate it did not make enough of it 
i did not appreciate it did not make enough of it  
 what s this 
am i going out of my mind  
he said to himself 
 perhaps 
what makes men go out of their minds what makes men shoot themselves  
he answered himself and opening his eyes he saw with wonder an embroidered cushion beside him worked by varya his brother s wife 
he touched the tassel of the cushion and tried to think of varya of when he had seen her last 
but to think of anything extraneous was an agonizing effort 
 no i must sleep  
he moved the cushion up and pressed his head into it but he had to make an effort to keep his eyes shut 
he jumped up and sat down 
 that s all over for me  he said to himself 
 i must think what to do 
what is left  
his mind rapidly ran through his life apart from his love of anna 
 ambition 
serpuhovskoy 
society 
the court  
he could not come to a pause anywhere 
all of it had had meaning before but now there was no reality in it 
he got up from the sofa took off his coat undid his belt and uncovering his hairy chest to breathe more freely walked up and down the room 
 this is how people go mad  he repeated and how they shoot themselves   to escape humiliation  he added slowly 
he went to the door and closed it then with fixed eyes and clenched teeth he went up to the table took a revolver looked round him turned it to a loaded barrel and sank into thought 
for two minutes his head bent forward with an expression of an intense effort of thought he stood with the revolver in his hand motionless thinking 
 of course  he said to himself as though a logical continuous and clear chain of reasoning had brought him to an indubitable conclusion 
in reality this of course  that seemed convincing to him was simply the result of exactly the same circle of memories and images through which he had passed ten times already during the last hour  memories of happiness lost forever 
there was the same conception of the senselessness of everything to come in life the same consciousness of humiliation 
even the sequence of these images and emotions was the same 
 of course  he repeated when for the third time his thought passed again round the same spellbound circle of memories and images and pulling the revolver to the left side of his chest and clutching it vigorously with his whole hand as it were squeezing it in his fist he pulled the trigger 
he did not hear the sound of the shot but a violent blow on his chest sent him reeling 
he tried to clutch at the edge of the table dropped the revolver staggered and sat down on the ground looking about him in astonishment 
he did not recognize his room looking up from the ground at the bent legs of the table at the wastepaper basket and the tiger skin rug 
the hurried creaking steps of his servant coming through the drawing room brought him to his senses 
he made an effort at thought and was aware that he was on the floor and seeing blood on the tiger skin rug and on his arm he knew he had shot himself 
 idiotic 
missed  
he said fumbling after the revolver 
the revolver was close beside him  he sought further off 
still feeling for it he stretched out to the other side and not being strong enough to keep his balance fell over streaming with blood 
the elegant whiskered manservant who used to be continually complaining to his acquaintances of the delicacy of his nerves was so panic stricken on seeing his master lying on the floor that he left him losing blood while he ran for assistance 
an hour later varya his brother s wife had arrived and with the assistance of three doctors whom she had sent for in all directions and who all appeared at the same moment she got the wounded man to bed and remained to nurse him 
chapter    the mistake made by alexey alexandrovitch in that when preparing for seeing his wife he had overlooked the possibility that her repentance might be sincere and he might forgive her and she might not die  this mistake was two months after his return from moscow brought home to him in all its significance 
but the mistake made by him had arisen not simply from his having overlooked that contingency but also from the fact that until that day of his interview with his dying wife he had not known his own heart 
at his sick wife s bedside he had for the first time in his life given way to that feeling of sympathetic suffering always roused in him by the sufferings of others and hitherto looked on by him with shame as a harmful weakness 
and pity for her and remorse for having desired her death and most of all the joy of forgiveness made him at once conscious not simply of the relief of his own sufferings but of a spiritual peace he had never experienced before 
he suddenly felt that the very thing that was the source of his sufferings had become the source of his spiritual joy that what had seemed insoluble while he was judging blaming and hating had become clear and simple when he forgave and loved 
he forgave his wife and pitied her for her sufferings and her remorse 
he forgave vronsky and pitied him especially after reports reached him of his despairing action 
he felt more for his son than before 
and he blamed himself now for having taken too little interest in him 
but for the little newborn baby he felt a quite peculiar sentiment not of pity only but of tenderness 
at first from a feeling of compassion alone he had been interested in the delicate little creature who was not his child and who was cast on one side during her mother s illness and would certainly have died if he had not troubled about her and he did not himself observe how fond he became of her 
he would go into the nursery several times a day and sit there for a long while so that the nurses who were at first afraid of him got quite used to his presence 
sometimes for half an hour at a stretch he would sit silently gazing at the saffron red downy wrinkled face of the sleeping baby watching the movements of the frowning brows and the fat little hands with clenched fingers that rubbed the little eyes and nose 
at such moments particularly alexey alexandrovitch had a sense of perfect peace and inward harmony and saw nothing extraordinary in his position nothing that ought to be changed 
but as time went on he saw more and more distinctly that however natural the position now seemed to him he would not long be allowed to remain in it 
he felt that besides the blessed spiritual force controlling his soul there was another a brutal force as powerful or more powerful which controlled his life and that this force would not allow him that humble peace he longed for 
he felt that everyone was looking at him with inquiring wonder that he was not understood and that something was expected of him 
above all he felt the instability and unnaturalness of his relations with his wife 
when the softening effect of the near approach of death had passed away alexey alexandrovitch began to notice that anna was afraid of him ill at ease with him and could not look him straight in the face 
she seemed to be wanting and not daring to tell him something and as though foreseeing their present relations could not continue she seemed to be expecting something from him 
towards the end of february it happened that anna s baby daughter who had been named anna too fell ill  alexey alexandrovitch was in the nursery in the morning and leaving orders for the doctor to be sent for he went to his office 
on finishing his work he returned home at four 
going into the hall he saw a handsome groom in a braided livery and a bear fur cape holding a white fur cloak 
 who is here  
asked alexey alexandrovitch 
 princess elizaveta federovna tverskaya  the groom answered and it seemed to alexey alexandrovitch that he grinned 
during all this difficult time alexey alexandrovitch had noticed that his worldly acquaintances especially women took a peculiar interest in him and his wife 
all these acquaintances he observed with difficulty concealing their mirth at something the same mirth that he had perceived in the lawyer s eyes and just now in the eyes of this groom 
everyone seemed somehow hugely delighted as though they had just been at a wedding 
when they met him with ill disguised enjoyment they inquired after his wife s health 
the presence of princess tverskaya was unpleasant to alexey alexandrovitch from the memories associated with her and also because he disliked her and he went straight to the nursery 
in the day nursery seryozha leaning on the table with his legs on a chair was drawing and chatting away merrily 
the english governess who had during anna s illness replaced the french one was sitting near the boy knitting a shawl 
she hurriedly got up curtseyed and pulled seryozha 
alexey alexandrovitch stroked his son s hair answered the governess s inquiries about his wife and asked what the doctor had said of the baby 
 the doctor said it was nothing serious and he ordered a bath sir  
 but she is still in pain  said alexey alexandrovitch listening to the baby s screaming in the next room 
 i think it s the wet nurse sir  the englishwoman said firmly 
 what makes you think so  
he asked stopping short 
 it s just as it was at countess paul s sir 
they gave the baby medicine and it turned out that the baby was simply hungry the nurse had no milk sir  
alexey alexandrovitch pondered and after standing still a few seconds he went in at the other door 
the baby was lying with its head thrown back stiffening itself in the nurse s arms and would not take the plump breast offered it and it never ceased screaming in spite of the double hushing of the wet nurse and the other nurse who was bending over her 
 still no better  
said alexey alexandrovitch 
 she s very restless  answered the nurse in a whisper 
 miss edwarde says that perhaps the wet nurse has no milk  he said 
 i think so too alexey alexandrovitch  
 then why didn t you say so  
 who s one to say it to 
anna arkadyevna still ill    said the nurse discontentedly 
the nurse was an old servant of the family 
and in her simple words there seemed to alexey alexandrovitch an allusion to his position 
the baby screamed louder than ever struggling and sobbing 
the nurse with a gesture of despair went to it took it from the wet nurse s arms and began walking up and down rocking it 
 you must ask the doctor to examine the wet nurse  said alexey alexandrovitch 
the smartly dressed and healthy looking nurse frightened at the idea of losing her place muttered something to herself and covering her bosom smiled contemptuously at the idea of doubts being cast on her abundance of milk 
in that smile too alexey alexandrovitch saw a sneer at his position 
 luckless child  
said the nurse hushing the baby and still walking up and down with it 
alexey alexandrovitch sat down and with a despondent and suffering face watched the nurse walking to and fro 
when the child at last was still and had been put in a deep bed and the nurse after smoothing the little pillow had left her alexey alexandrovitch got up and walking awkwardly on tiptoe approached the baby 
for a minute he was still and with the same despondent face gazed at the baby but all at once a smile that moved his hair and the skin of his forehead came out on his face and he went as softly out of the room 
in the dining room he rang the bell and told the servant who came in to send again for the doctor 
he felt vexed with his wife for not being anxious about this exquisite baby and in this vexed humor he had no wish to go to her he had no wish either to see princess betsy 
but his wife might wonder why he did not go to her as usual and so overcoming his disinclination he went towards the bedroom 
as he walked over the soft rug towards the door he could not help overhearing a conversation he did not want to hear 
 if he hadn t been going away i could have understood your answer and his too 
but your husband ought to be above that  betsy was saying 
 it s not for my husband for myself i don t wish it 
don t say that  
answered anna s excited voice 
 yes but you must care to say good bye to a man who has shot himself on your account      that s just why i don t want to  
with a dismayed and guilty expression alexey alexandrovitch stopped and would have gone back unobserved 
but reflecting that this would be undignified he turned back again and clearing his throat he went up to the bedroom 
the voices were silent and he went in 
anna in a gray dressing gown with a crop of short clustering black curls on her round head was sitting on a settee 
the eagerness died out of her face as it always did at the sight of her husband she dropped her head and looked round uneasily at betsy 
betsy dressed in the height of the latest fashion in a hat that towered somewhere over her head like a shade on a lamp in a blue dress with violet crossway stripes slanting one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt was sitting beside anna her tall flat figure held erect 
bowing her head she greeted alexey alexandrovitch with an ironical smile 
 ah  
she said as though surprised 
 i m very glad you re at home 
you never put in an appearance anywhere and i haven t seen you ever since anna has been ill 
i have heard all about it  your anxiety 
yes you re a wonderful husband  
she said with a meaning and affable air as though she were bestowing an order of magnanimity on him for his conduct to his wife 
alexey alexandrovitch bowed frigidly and kissing his wife s hand asked how she was 
 better i think  she said avoiding his eyes 
 but you ve rather a feverish looking color  he said laying stress on the word feverish  
 we ve been talking too much  said betsy 
 i feel it s selfishness on my part and i am going away  
she got up but anna suddenly flushing quickly caught at her hand 
 no wait a minute please 
i must tell you   no you  
she turned to alexey alexandrovitch and her neck and brow were suffused with crimson 
 i won t and can t keep anything secret from you  she said 
alexey alexandrovitch cracked his fingers and bowed his head 
 betsy s been telling me that count vronsky wants to come here to say good bye before his departure for tashkend  
she did not look at her husband and was evidently in haste to have everything out however hard it might be for her 
 i told her i could not receive him  
 you said my dear that it would depend on alexey alexandrovitch  betsy corrected her 
 oh no i can t receive him and what object would there     she stopped suddenly and glanced inquiringly at her husband he did not look at her  
 in short i don t wish it      alexey alexandrovitch advanced and would have taken her hand 
her first impulse was to jerk back her hand from the damp hand with big swollen veins that sought hers but with an obvious effort to control herself she pressed his hand 
 i am very grateful to you for your confidence but    he said feeling with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide easily and clearly by himself he could not discuss before princess tverskaya who to him stood for the incarnation of that brute force which would inevitably control him in the life he led in the eyes of the world and hinder him from giving way to his feeling of love and forgiveness 
he stopped short looking at princess tverskaya 
 well good bye my darling  said betsy getting up 
she kissed anna and went out 
alexey alexandrovitch escorted her out 
 alexey alexandrovitch 
i know you are a truly magnanimous man  said betsy stopping in the little drawing room and with special warmth shaking hands with him once more 
 i am an outsider but i so love her and respect you that i venture to advise 
receive him 
alexey vronsky is the soul of honor and he is going away to tashkend  
 thank you princess for your sympathy and advice 
but the question of whether my wife can or cannot see anyone she must decide herself  
he said this from habit lifting his brows with dignity and reflected immediately that whatever his words might be there could be no dignity in his position 
and he saw this by the suppressed malicious and ironical smile with which betsy glanced at him after this phrase 
chapter    alexey alexandrovitch took leave of betsy in the drawing room and went to his wife 
she was lying down but hearing his steps she sat up hastily in her former attitude and looked in a scared way at him 
he saw she had been crying 
 i am very grateful for your confidence in me  
he repeated gently in russian the phrase he had said in betsy s presence in french and sat down beside her 
when he spoke to her in russian using the russian thou of intimacy and affection it was insufferably irritating to anna 
 and i am very grateful for your decision 
i too imagine that since he is going away there is no sort of necessity for count vronsky to come here 
however if     but i ve said so already so why repeat it  
anna suddenly interrupted him with an irritation she could not succeed in repressing 
 no sort of necessity  she thought for a man to come and say good bye to the woman he loves for whom he was ready to ruin himself and has ruined himself and who cannot live without him 
no sort of necessity  
she compressed her lips and dropped her burning eyes to his hands with their swollen veins 
they were rubbing each other 
 let us never speak of it  she added more calmly 
 i have left this question to you to decide and i am very glad to see    alexey alexandrovitch was beginning 
 that my wish coincides with your own  she finished quickly exasperated at his talking so slowly while she knew beforehand all he would say 
 yes  he assented and princess tverskaya s interference in the most difficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for 
she especially     i don t believe a word of what s said about her  said anna quickly 
 i know she really cares for me  
alexey alexandrovitch sighed and said nothing 
she played nervously with the tassel of her dressing gown glancing at him with that torturing sensation of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself though she could not control it 
her only desire now was to be rid of his oppressive presence 
 i have just sent for the doctor  said alexey alexandrovitch 
 i am very well what do i want the doctor for  
 no the little one cries and they say the nurse hasn t enough milk  
 why didn t you let me nurse her when i begged to 
anyway alexey alexandrovitch knew what was meant by that anyway   she s a baby and they re killing her  
she rang the bell and ordered the baby to be brought her 
 i begged to nurse her i wasn t allowed to and now i m blamed for it  
 i don t blame     yes you do blame me 
my god 
why didn t i die  
and she broke into sobs 
 forgive me i m nervous i m unjust  she said controlling herself but do go away     no it can t go on like this  alexey alexandrovitch said to himself decidedly as he left his wife s room 
never had the impossibility of his position in the world s eyes and his wife s hatred of him and altogether the might of that mysterious brutal force that guided his life against his spiritual inclinations and exacted conformity with its decrees and change in his attitude to his wife been presented to him with such distinctness as that day 
he saw clearly that all the world and his wife expected of him something but what exactly he could not make out 
he felt that this was rousing in his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind and of all the good of his achievement 
he believed that for anna herself it would be better to break off all relations with vronsky but if they all thought this out of the question he was even ready to allow these relations to be renewed so long as the children were not disgraced and he was not deprived of them nor forced to change his position 
bad as this might be it was anyway better than a rupture which would put her in a hopeless and shameful position and deprive him of everything he cared for 
but he felt helpless he knew beforehand that every one was against him and that he would not be allowed to do what seemed to him now so natural and right but would be forced to do what was wrong though it seemed the proper thing to them 
chapter    before betsy had time to walk out of the drawing room she was met in the doorway by stepan arkadyevitch who had just come from yeliseev s where a consignment of fresh oysters had been received 
 ah 
princess 
what a delightful meeting  
he began 
 i ve been to see you  
 a meeting for one minute for i m going  said betsy smiling and putting on her glove 
 don t put on your glove yet princess let me kiss your hand 
there s nothing i m so thankful to the revival of the old fashions for as the kissing the hand  
he kissed betsy s hand 
 when shall we see each other  
 you don t deserve it  answered betsy smiling 
 oh yes i deserve a great deal for i ve become a most serious person 
i don t only manage my own affairs but other people s too  he said with a significant expression 
 oh i m so glad  
answered betsy at once understanding that he was speaking of anna 
and going back into the drawing room they stood in a corner 
 he s killing her  said betsy in a whisper full of meaning 
 it s impossible impossible     i m so glad you think so  said stepan arkadyevitch shaking his head with a serious and sympathetically distressed expression that s what i ve come to petersburg for  
 the whole town s talking of it  she said 
 it s an impossible position 
she pines and pines away 
he doesn t understand that she s one of those women who can t trifle with their feelings 
one of two things either let him take her away act with energy or give her a divorce 
this is stifling her  
 yes yes   just so    oblonsky said sighing 
 that s what i ve come for 
at least not solely for that   i ve been made a kammerherr  of course one has to say thank you 
but the chief thing was having to settle this  
 well god help you  
said betsy 
after accompanying betsy to the outside hall once more kissing her hand above the glove at the point where the pulse beats and murmuring to her such unseemly nonsense that she did not know whether to laugh or be angry stepan arkadyevitch went to his sister 
he found her in tears 
although he happened to be bubbling over with good spirits stepan arkadyevitch immediately and quite naturally fell into the sympathetic poetically emotional tone which harmonized with her mood 
he asked her how she was and how she had spent the morning 
 very very miserably 
today and this morning and all past days and days to come  she said 
 i think you re giving way to pessimism 
you must rouse yourself you must look life in the face 
i know it s hard but     i have heard it said that women love men even for their vices  anna began suddenly but i hate him for his virtues 
i can t live with him 
do you understand 
the sight of him has a physical effect on me it makes me beside myself 
i can t i can t live with him 
what am i to do 
i have been unhappy and used to think one couldn t be more unhappy but the awful state of things i am going through now i could never have conceived 
would you believe it that knowing he s a good man a splendid man that i m not worth his little finger still i hate him 
i hate him for his generosity 
and there s nothing left for me but     she would have said death but stepan arkadyevitch would not let her finish 
 you are ill and overwrought  he said believe me you re exaggerating dreadfully 
there s nothing so terrible in it  
and stepan arkadyevitch smiled 
no one else in stepan arkadyevitch s place having to do with such despair would have ventured to smile the smile would have seemed brutal  but in his smile there was so much of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile did not wound but softened and soothed 
his gentle soothing words and smiles were as soothing and softening as almond oil 
and anna soon felt this 
 no stiva  she said i m lost lost 
worse than lost 
i can t say yet that all is over on the contrary i feel that it s not over 
i m an overstrained string that must snap 
but it s not ended yet   and it will have a fearful end  
 no matter we must let the string be loosened little by little 
there s no position from which there is no way of escape  
 i have thought and thought 
only one     again he knew from her terrified eyes that this one way of escape in her thought was death and he would not let her say it 
 not at all  he said 
 listen to me 
you can t see your own position as i can 
let me tell you candidly my opinion  
again he smiled discreetly his almond oil smile 
 i ll begin from the beginning 
you married a man twenty years older than yourself 
you married him without love and not knowing what love was 
it was a mistake let s admit  
 a fearful mistake  
said anna 
 but i repeat it s an accomplished fact 
then you had let us say the misfortune to love a man not your husband 
that was a misfortune but that too is an accomplished fact 
and your husband knew it and forgave it  
he stopped at each sentence waiting for her to object but she made no answer 
 that s so 
now the question is can you go on living with your husband 
do you wish it 
does he wish it  
 i know nothing nothing  
 but you said yourself that you can t endure him  
 no i didn t say so 
i deny it 
i can t tell i don t know anything about it  
 yes but let     you can t understand 
i feel i m lying head downwards in a sort of pit but i ought not to save myself 
and i can t 
 
  
 never mind we ll slip something under and pull you out 
i understand you i understand that you can t take it on yourself to express your wishes your feelings  
 there s nothing nothing i wish   except for it to be all over  
 but he sees this and knows it 
and do you suppose it weighs on him any less than on you 
you re wretched he s wretched and what good can come of it 
while divorce would solve the difficulty completely  
with some effort stepan arkadyevitch brought out his central idea and looked significantly at her 
she said nothing and shook her cropped head in dissent 
but from the look in her face that suddenly brightened into its old beauty he saw that if she did not desire this it was simply because it seemed to her unattainable happiness 
 i m awfully sorry for you 
and how happy i should be if i could arrange things  
said stepan arkadyevitch smiling more boldly 
 don t speak don t say a word 
god grant only that i may speak as i feel 
i m going to him  
anna looked at him with dreamy shining eyes and said nothing 
chapter    stepan arkadyevitch with the same somewhat solemn expression with which he used to take his presidential chair at his board walked into alexey alexandrovitch s room 
alexey alexandrovitch was walking about his room with his hands behind his back thinking of just what stepan arkadyevitch had been discussing with his wife 
 i m not interrupting you  
said stepan arkadyevitch on the sight of his brother in law becoming suddenly aware of a sense of embarrassment unusual with him 
to conceal this embarrassment he took out a cigarette case he had just bought that opened in a new way and sniffing the leather took a cigarette out of it 
 no 
do you want anything  
alexey alexandrovitch asked without eagerness 
 yes i wished   i wanted   yes i wanted to talk to you  said stepan arkadyevitch with surprise aware of an unaccustomed timidity 
this feeling was so unexpected and so strange that he did not believe it was the voice of conscience telling him that what he was meaning to do was wrong 
stepan arkadyevitch made an effort and struggled with the timidity that had come over him 
 i hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere affection and respect for you  he said reddening 
alexey alexandrovitch stood still and said nothing but his face struck stepan arkadyevitch by its expression of an unresisting sacrifice 
 i intended   i wanted to have a little talk with you about my sister and your mutual position  he said still struggling with an unaccustomed constraint 
alexey alexandrovitch smiled mournfully looked at his brother in law and without answering went up to the table took from it an unfinished letter and handed it to his brother in law 
 i think unceasingly of the same thing 
and here is what i had begun writing thinking i could say it better by letter and that my presence irritates her  he said as he gave him the letter 
stepan arkadyevitch took the letter looked with incredulous surprise at the lusterless eyes fixed so immovably on him and began to read 
 i see that my presence is irksome to you 
painful as it is to me to believe it i see that it is so and cannot be otherwise 
i don t blame you and god is my witness that on seeing you at the time of your illness i resolved with my whole heart to forget all that had passed between us and to begin a new life 
i do not regret and shall never regret what i have done but i have desired one thing  your good the good of your soul  and now i see i have not attained that 
tell me yourself what will give you true happiness and peace to your soul 
i put myself entirely in your hands and trust to your feeling of what s right  
stepan arkadyevitch handed back the letter and with the same surprise continued looking at his brother in law not knowing what to say 
this silence was so awkward for both of them that stepan arkadyevitch s lips began twitching nervously while he still gazed without speaking at karenin s face 
 that s what i wanted to say to her  said alexey alexandrovitch turning away 
 yes yes    said stepan arkadyevitch not able to answer for the tears that were choking him 
 yes yes i understand you  he brought out at last 
 i want to know what she would like  said alexey alexandrovitch 
 i am afraid she does not understand her own position 
she is not a judge  said stepan arkadyevitch recovering himself 
 she is crushed simply crushed by your generosity 
if she were to read this letter she would be incapable of saying anything she would only hang her head lower than ever  
 yes but what s to be done in that case 
how explain how find out her wishes  
 if you will allow me to give my opinion i think that it lies with you to point out directly the steps you consider necessary to end the position  
 so you consider it must be ended  
alexey alexandrovitch interrupted him 
 but how  
he added with a gesture of his hands before his eyes not usual with him 
 i see no possible way out of it  
 there is some way of getting out of every position  said stepan arkadyevitch standing up and becoming more cheerful 
 there was a time when you thought of breaking off    
if you are convinced now that you cannot make each other happy     happiness may be variously understood 
but suppose that i agree to everything that i want nothing what way is there of getting out of our position  
 if you care to know my opinion  said stepan arkadyevitch with the same smile of softening almond oil tenderness with which he had been talking to anna 
his kindly smile was so winning that alexey alexandrovitch feeling his own weakness and unconsciously swayed by it was ready to believe what stepan arkadyevitch was saying 
 she will never speak out about it 
but one thing is possible one thing she might desire  he went on that is the cessation of your relations and all memories associated with them 
to my thinking in your position what s essential is the formation of a new attitude to one another 
and that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both sides  
 divorce  alexey alexandrovitch interrupted in a tone of aversion 
 yes i imagine that divorce  yes divorce  stepan arkadyevitch repeated reddening 
 that is from every point of view the most rational course for married people who find themselves in the position you are in 
what can be done if married people find that life is impossible for them together 
that may always happen  
alexey alexandrovitch sighed heavily and closed his eyes 
 there s only one point to be considered is either of the parties desirous of forming new ties 
if not it is very simple  said stepan arkadyevitch feeling more and more free from constraint 
alexey alexandrovitch scowling with emotion muttered something to himself and made no answer 
all that seemed so simple to stepan arkadyevitch alexey alexandrovitch had thought over thousands of times 
and so far from being simple it all seemed to him utterly impossible 
divorce the details of which he knew by this time seemed to him now out of the question because the sense of his own dignity and respect for religion forbade his taking upon himself a fictitious charge of adultery and still more suffering his wife pardoned and beloved by him to be caught in the fact and put to public shame 
divorce appeared to him impossible also on other still more weighty grounds 
what would become of his son in case of a divorce 
to leave him with his mother was out of the question 
the divorced mother would have her own illegitimate family in which his position as a stepson and his education would not be good 
keep him with him 
he knew that would be an act of vengeance on his part and that he did not want 
but apart from this what more than all made divorce seem impossible to alexey alexandrovitch was that by consenting to a divorce he would be completely ruining anna 
the saying of darya alexandrovna at moscow that in deciding on a divorce he was thinking of himself and not considering that by this he would be ruining her irrevocably had sunk into his heart 
and connecting this saying with his forgiveness of her with his devotion to the children he understood it now in his own way 
to consent to a divorce to give her her freedom meant in his thoughts to take from himself the last tie that bound him to life  the children whom he loved and to take from her the last prop that stayed her on the path of right to thrust her down to her ruin 
if she were divorced he knew she would join her life to vronsky s and their tie would be an illegitimate and criminal one since a wife by the interpretation of the ecclesiastical law could not marry while her husband was living 
 she will join him and in a year or two he will throw her over or she will form a new tie  thought alexey alexandrovitch 
 and i by agreeing to an unlawful divorce shall be to blame for her ruin  
he had thought it all over hundreds of times and was convinced that a divorce was not at all simple as stepan arkadyevitch had said but was utterly impossible 
he did not believe a single word stepan arkadyevitch said to him to every word he had a thousand objections to make but he listened to him feeling that his words were the expression of that mighty brutal force which controlled his life and to which he would have to submit 
 the only question is on what terms you agree to give her a divorce 
she does not want anything does not dare ask you for anything she leaves it all to your generosity  
 my god my god 
what for  
thought alexey alexandrovitch remembering the details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took the blame on himself and with just the same gesture with which vronsky had done the same he hid his face for shame in his hands 
 you are distressed i understand that 
but if you think it over     whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also  thought alexey alexandrovitch 
 yes yes  
he cried in a shrill voice 
 i will take the disgrace on myself i will give up even my son but   but wouldn t it be better to let it alone 
still you may do as you like     and turning away so that his brother in law could not see him he sat down on a chair at the window 
there was bitterness there was shame in his heart but with bitterness and shame he felt joy and emotion at the height of his own meekness 
stepan arkadyevitch was touched 
he was silent for a space 
 alexey alexandrovitch believe me she appreciates your generosity  he said 
 but it seems it was the will of god  he added and as he said it felt how foolish a remark it was and with difficulty repressed a smile at his own foolishness 
alexey alexandrovitch would have made some reply but tears stopped him 
 this is an unhappy fatality and one must accept it as such 
i accept the calamity as an accomplished fact and am doing my best to help both her and you  said stepan arkadyevitch 
when he went out of his brother in law s room he was touched but that did not prevent him from being glad he had successfully brought the matter to a conclusion for he felt certain alexey alexandrovitch would not go back on his words 
to this satisfaction was added the fact that an idea had just struck him for a riddle turning on his successful achievement that when the affair was over he would ask his wife and most intimate friends 
he put this riddle into two or three different ways 
 but i ll work it out better than that  he said to himself with a smile 
chapter    vronsky s wound had been a dangerous one though it did not touch the heart and for several days he had lain between life and death 
the first time he was able to speak varya his brother s wife was alone in the room 
 varya  he said looking sternly at her i shot myself by accident 
and please never speak of it and tell everyone so 
or else it s too ridiculous  
without answering his words varya bent over him and with a delighted smile gazed into his face 
his eyes were clear not feverish but their expression was stern 
 thank god  
she said 
 you re not in pain  
 a little here  
he pointed to his breast 
 then let me change your bandages  
in silence stiffening his broad jaws he looked at her while she bandaged him up 
when she had finished he said  i m not delirious 
please manage that there may be no talk of my having shot myself on purpose  
 no one does say so 
only i hope you won t shoot yourself by accident any more  she said with a questioning smile 
 of course i won t but it would have been better     and he smiled gloomily 
in spite of these words and this smile which so frightened varya when the inflammation was over and he began to recover he felt that he was completely free from one part of his misery 
by his action he had as it were washed away the shame and humiliation he had felt before 
he could now think calmly of alexey alexandrovitch 
he recognized all his magnanimity but he did not now feel himself humiliated by it 
besides he got back again into the beaten track of his life 
he saw the possibility of looking men in the face again without shame and he could live in accordance with his own habits 
one thing he could not pluck out of his heart though he never ceased struggling with it was the regret amounting to despair that he had lost her forever 
that now having expiated his sin against the husband he was bound to renounce her and never in future to stand between her with her repentance and her husband he had firmly decided in his heart but he could not tear out of his heart his regret at the loss of her love he could not erase from his memory those moments of happiness that he had so little prized at the time and that haunted him in all their charm 
serpuhovskoy had planned his appointment at tashkend and vronsky agreed to the proposition without the slightest hesitation 
but the nearer the time of departure came the bitterer was the sacrifice he was making to what he thought his duty 
his wound had healed and he was driving about making preparations for his departure for tashkend 
 to see her once and then to bury myself to die  he thought and as he was paying farewell visits he uttered this thought to betsy 
charged with this commission betsy had gone to anna and brought him back a negative reply 
 so much the better  thought vronsky when he received the news 
 it was a weakness which would have shattered what strength i have left  
next day betsy herself came to him in the morning and announced that she had heard through oblonsky as a positive fact that alexey alexandrovitch had agreed to a divorce and that therefore vronsky could see anna 
without even troubling himself to see betsy out of his flat forgetting all his resolutions without asking when he could see her where her husband was vronsky drove straight to the karenins  
he ran up the stairs seeing no one and nothing and with a rapid step almost breaking into a run he went into her room 
and without considering without noticing whether there was anyone in the room or not he flung his arms round her and began to cover her face her hands her neck with kisses 
anna had been preparing herself for this meeting had thought what she would say to him but she did not succeed in saying anything of it his passion mastered her 
she tried to calm him to calm herself but it was too late 
his feeling infected her 
her lips trembled so that for a long while she could say nothing 
 yes you have conquered me and i am yours  she said at last pressing his hands to her bosom 
 so it had to be  he said 
 so long as we live it must be so 
i know it now  
 that s true  she said getting whiter and whiter and embracing his head 
 still there is something terrible in it after all that has happened  
 it will all pass it will all pass we shall be so happy 
our love if it could be stronger will be strengthened by there being something terrible in it  he said lifting his head and parting his strong teeth in a smile 
and she could not but respond with a smile  not to his words but to the love in his eyes 
she took his hand and stroked her chilled cheeks and cropped head with it 
 i don t know you with this short hair 
you ve grown so pretty 
a boy 
but how pale you are  
 yes i m very weak  she said smiling 
and her lips began trembling again 
 we ll go to italy you will get strong  he said 
 can it be possible we could be like husband and wife alone your family with you  
she said looking close into his eyes 
 it only seems strange to me that it can ever have been otherwise  
 stiva says that  he  has agreed to everything but i can t accept his  generosity  she said looking dreamily past vronsky s face 
 i don t want a divorce it s all the same to me now 
only i don t know what he will decide about seryozha  
he could not conceive how at this moment of their meeting she could remember and think of her son of divorce 
what did it all matter 
 don t speak of that don t think of it  he said turning her hand in his and trying to draw her attention to him but still she did not look at him 
 oh why didn t i die 
it would have been better  she said and silent tears flowed down both her cheeks but she tried to smile so as not to wound him 
to decline the flattering and dangerous appointment at tashkend would have been vronsky had till then considered disgraceful and impossible 
but now without an instant s consideration he declined it and observing dissatisfaction in the most exalted quarters at this step he immediately retired from the army 
a month later alexey alexandrovitch was left alone with his son in his house at petersburg while anna and vronsky had gone abroad not having obtained a divorce but having absolutely declined all idea of one 
part     chapter    princess shtcherbatskaya considered that it was out of the question for the wedding to take place before lent just five weeks off since not half the trousseau could possibly be ready by that time 
but she could not but agree with levin that to fix it for after lent would be putting it off too late as an old aunt of prince shtcherbatsky s was seriously ill and might die and then the mourning would delay the wedding still longer 
and therefore deciding to divide the trousseau into two parts  a larger and smaller trousseau  the princess consented to have the wedding before lent 
she determined that she would get the smaller part of the trousseau all ready now and the larger part should be made later and she was much vexed with levin because he was incapable of giving her a serious answer to the question whether he agreed to this arrangement or not 
the arrangement was the more suitable as immediately after the wedding the young people were to go to the country where the more important part of the trousseau would not be wanted 
levin still continued in the same delirious condition in which it seemed to him that he and his happiness constituted the chief and sole aim of all existence and that he need not now think or care about anything that everything was being done and would be done for him by others 
he had not even plans and aims for the future he left its arrangement to others knowing that everything would be delightful 
his brother sergey ivanovitch stepan arkadyevitch and the princess guided him in doing what he had to do 
all he did was to agree entirely with everything suggested to him 
his brother raised money for him the princess advised him to leave moscow after the wedding 
stepan arkadyevitch advised him to go abroad 
he agreed to everything 
 do what you choose if it amuses you 
i m happy and my happiness can be no greater and no less for anything you do  he thought 
when he told kitty of stepan arkadyevitch s advice that they should go abroad he was much surprised that she did not agree to this and had some definite requirements of her own in regard to their future 
she knew levin had work he loved in the country 
she did not as he saw understand this work she did not even care to understand it 
but that did not prevent her from regarding it as a matter of great importance 
and then she knew their home would be in the country and she wanted to go not abroad where she was not going to live but to the place where their home would be 
this definitely expressed purpose astonished levin 
but since he did not care either way he immediately asked stepan arkadyevitch as though it were his duty to go down to the country and to arrange everything there to the best of his ability with the taste of which he had so much 
 but i say  stepan arkadyevitch said to him one day after he had come back from the country where he had got everything ready for the young people s arrival have you a certificate of having been at confession  
 no 
but what of it  
 you can t be married without it  
 aïe aïe aïe 
cried levin 
 why i believe it s nine years since i ve taken the sacrament 
i never thought of it  
 you re a pretty fellow  
said stepan arkadyevitch laughing and you call me a nihilist 
but this won t do you know 
you must take the sacrament  
 when 
there are four days left now  
stepan arkadyevitch arranged this also and levin had to go to confession 
to levin as to any unbeliever who respects the beliefs of others it was exceedingly disagreeable to be present at and take part in church ceremonies 
at this moment in his present softened state of feeling sensitive to everything this inevitable act of hypocrisy was not merely painful to levin it seemed to him utterly impossible 
now in the heyday of his highest glory his fullest flower he would have to be a liar or a scoffer 
he felt incapable of being either 
but though he repeatedly plied stepan arkadyevitch with questions as to the possibility of obtaining a certificate without actually communicating stepan arkadyevitch maintained that it was out of the question 
 besides what is it to you  two days 
and he s an awfully nice clever old fellow 
he ll pull the tooth out for you so gently you won t notice it  
standing at the first litany levin attempted to revive in himself his youthful recollections of the intense religious emotion he had passed through between the ages of sixteen and seventeen 
but he was at once convinced that it was utterly impossible to him 
he attempted to look at it all as an empty custom having no sort of meaning like the custom of paying calls 
but he felt that he could not do that either 
levin found himself like the majority of his contemporaries in the vaguest position in regard to religion 
believe he could not and at the same time he had no firm conviction that it was all wrong 
and consequently not being able to believe in the significance of what he was doing nor to regard it with indifference as an empty formality during the whole period of preparing for the sacrament he was conscious of a feeling of discomfort and shame at doing what he did not himself understand and what as an inner voice told him was therefore false and wrong 
during the service he would first listen to the prayers trying to attach some meaning to them not discordant with his own views then feeling that he could not understand and must condemn them he tried not to listen to them but to attend to the thoughts observations and memories which floated through his brain with extreme vividness during this idle time of standing in church 
he had stood through the litany the evening service and the midnight service and the next day he got up earlier than usual and without having tea went at eight o clock in the morning to the church for the morning service and the confession 
there was no one in the church but a beggar soldier two old women and the church officials 
a young deacon whose long back showed in two distinct halves through his thin undercassock met him and at once going to a little table at the wall read the exhortation 
during the reading especially at the frequent and rapid repetition of the same words lord have mercy on us  
which resounded with an echo levin felt that thought was shut and sealed up and that it must not be touched or stirred now or confusion would be the result and so standing behind the deacon he went on thinking of his own affairs neither listening nor examining what was said 
 it s wonderful what expression there is in her hand  he thought remembering how they had been sitting the day before at a corner table 
they had nothing to talk about as was almost always the case at this time and laying her hand on the table she kept opening and shutting it and laughed herself as she watched her action 
he remembered how he had kissed it and then had examined the lines on the pink palm 
 have mercy on us again  
thought levin crossing himself bowing and looking at the supple spring of the deacon s back bowing before him 
 she took my hand then and examined the lines you ve got a splendid hand  she said  
and he looked at his own hand and the short hand of the deacon 
 yes now it will soon be over  he thought 
 no it seems to be beginning again  he thought listening to the prayers 
 no it s just ending there he is bowing down to the ground 
that s always at the end  
the deacon s hand in a plush cuff accepted a three rouble note unobtrusively and the deacon said he would put it down in the register and his new boots creaking jauntily over the flagstones of the empty church he went to the altar 
a moment later he peeped out thence and beckoned to levin 
thought till then locked up began to stir in levin s head but he made haste to drive it away 
 it will come right somehow  he thought and went towards the altar rails 
he went up the steps and turning to the right saw the priest 
the priest a little old man with a scanty grizzled beard and weary good natured eyes was standing at the altar rails turning over the pages of a missal 
with a slight bow to levin he began immediately reading prayers in the official voice 
when he had finished them he bowed down to the ground and turned facing levin 
 christ is present here unseen receiving your confession  he said pointing to the crucifix 
 do you believe in all the doctrines of the holy apostolic church  
the priest went on turning his eyes away from levin s face and folding his hands under his stole 
 i have doubted i doubt everything  said levin in a voice that jarred on himself and he ceased speaking 
the priest waited a few seconds to see if he would not say more and closing his eyes he said quickly with a broad vladimirsky accent  doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind but we must pray that god in his mercy will strengthen us 
what are your special sins  
he added without the slightest interval as though anxious not to waste time 
 my chief sin is doubt 
i have doubts of everything and for the most part i am in doubt  
 doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind  the priest repeated the same words 
 what do you doubt about principally  
 i doubt of everything 
i sometimes even have doubts of the existence of god  levin could not help saying and he was horrified at the impropriety of what he was saying 
but levin s words did not it seemed make much impression on the priest 
 what sort of doubt can there be of the existence of god  
he said hurriedly with a just perceptible smile 
levin did not speak 
 what doubt can you have of the creator when you behold his creation  
the priest went on in the rapid customary jargon 
 who has decked the heavenly firmament with its lights 
who has clothed the earth in its beauty 
how explain it without the creator  
he said looking inquiringly at levin 
levin felt that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical discussion with the priest and so he said in reply merely what was a direct answer to the question 
 i don t know  he said 
 you don t know 
then how can you doubt that god created all  
the priest said with good humored perplexity 
 i don t understand it at all  said levin blushing and feeling that his words were stupid and that they could not be anything but stupid in such a position 
 pray to god and beseech him 
even the holy fathers had doubts and prayed to god to strengthen their faith 
the devil has great power and we must resist him 
pray to god beseech him 
pray to god  he repeated hurriedly 
the priest paused for some time as though meditating 
 you re about i hear to marry the daughter of my parishioner and son in the spirit prince shtcherbatsky  
he resumed with a smile 
 an excellent young lady  
 yes  answered levin blushing for the priest 
 what does he want to ask me about this at confession for  
he thought 
and as though answering his thought the priest said to him  you are about to enter into holy matrimony and god may bless you with offspring 
well what sort of bringing up can you give your babes if you do not overcome the temptation of the devil enticing you to infidelity  
he said with gentle reproachfulness 
 if you love your child as a good father you will not desire only wealth luxury honor for your infant you will be anxious for his salvation his spiritual enlightenment with the light of truth 
eh 
what answer will you make him when the innocent babe asks you papa 
who made all that enchants me in this world  the earth the waters the sun the flowers the grass  
can you say to him i don t know  
you cannot but know since the lord god in his infinite mercy has revealed it to us 
or your child will ask you what awaits me in the life beyond the tomb  
what will you say to him when you know nothing 
how will you answer him 
will you leave him to the allurements of the world and the devil 
that s not right  he said and he stopped putting his head on one side and looking at levin with his kindly gentle eyes 
levin made no answer this time not because he did not want to enter upon a discussion with the priest but because so far no one had ever asked him such questions and when his babes did ask him those questions it would be time enough to think about answering them 
 you are entering upon a time of life  pursued the priest when you must choose your path and keep to it 
pray to god that he may in his mercy aid you and have mercy on you  
he concluded 
 our lord and god jesus christ in the abundance and riches of his lovingkindness forgives this child    and finishing the prayer of absolution the priest blessed him and dismissed him 
on getting home that day levin had a delightful sense of relief at the awkward position being over and having been got through without his having to tell a lie 
apart from this there remained a vague memory that what the kind nice old fellow had said had not been at all so stupid as he had fancied at first and that there was something in it that must be cleared up 
 of course not now  thought levin but some day later on  
levin felt more than ever now that there was something not clear and not clean in his soul and that in regard to religion he was in the same position which he perceived so clearly and disliked in others and for which he blamed his friend sviazhsky 
levin spent that evening with his betrothed at dolly s and was in very high spirits 
to explain to stepan arkadyevitch the state of excitement in which he found himself he said that he was happy like a dog being trained to jump through a hoop who having at last caught the idea and done what was required of him whines and wags its tail and jumps up to the table and the windows in its delight 
chapter    on the day of the wedding according to the russian custom the princess and darya alexandrovna insisted on strictly keeping all the customs  levin did not see his betrothed and dined at his hotel with three bachelor friends casually brought together at his rooms 
these were sergey ivanovitch katavasov a university friend now professor of natural science whom levin had met in the street and insisted on taking home with him and tchirikov his best man a moscow conciliation board judge levin s companion in his bear hunts 
the dinner was a very merry one sergey ivanovitch was in his happiest mood and was much amused by katavasov s originality 
katavasov feeling his originality was appreciated and understood made the most of it 
tchirikov always gave a lively and good humored support to conversation of any sort 
 see now  said katavasov drawling his words from a habit acquired in the lecture room what a capable fellow was our friend konstantin dmitrievitch 
i m not speaking of present company for he s absent 
at the time he left the university he was fond of science took an interest in humanity now one half of his abilities is devoted to deceiving himself and the other to justifying the deceit  
 a more determined enemy of matrimony than you i never saw  said sergey ivanovitch 
 oh no i m not an enemy of matrimony 
i m in favor of division of labor 
people who can do nothing else ought to rear people while the rest work for their happiness and enlightenment 
that s how i look at it 
to muddle up two trades is the error of the amateur i m not one of their number  
 how happy i shall be when i hear that you re in love  
said levin 
 please invite me to the wedding  
 i m in love now  
 yes with a cuttlefish 
you know  levin turned to his brother mihail semyonovitch is writing a work on the digestive organs of the     now make a muddle of it 
it doesn t matter what about 
and the fact is i certainly do love cuttlefish  
 but that s no hindrance to your loving your wife  
 the cuttlefish is no hindrance 
the wife is the hindrance  
 why so  
 oh you ll see 
you care about farming hunting   well you d better look out  
 arhip was here today he said there were a lot of elks in prudno and two bears  said tchirikov 
 well you must go and get them without me  
 ah that s the truth  said sergey ivanovitch 
 and you may say good bye to bear hunting for the future  your wife won t allow it  
levin smiled 
the picture of his wife not letting him go was so pleasant that he was ready to renounce the delights of looking upon bears forever 
 still it s a pity they should get those two bears without you 
do you remember last time at hapilovo 
that was a delightful hunt  
said tchirikov 
levin had not the heart to disillusion him of the notion that there could be something delightful apart from her and so said nothing 
 there s some sense in this custom of saying good bye to bachelor life  said sergey ivanovitch 
 however happy you may be you must regret your freedom  
 and confess there is a feeling that you want to jump out of the window like gogol s bridegroom  
 of course there is but it isn t confessed  said katavasov and he broke into loud laughter 
 oh well the window s open 
let s start off this instant to tver 
there s a big she bear one can go right up to the lair 
seriously let s go by the five o clock 
and here let them do what they like  said tchirikov smiling 
 well now on my honor  said levin smiling i can t find in my heart that feeling of regret for my freedom  
 yes there s such a chaos in your heart just now that you can t find anything there  said katavasov 
 wait a bit when you set it to rights a little you ll find it  
 no if so i should have felt a little apart from my feeling he could not say love before them and happiness a certain regret at losing my freedom     on the contrary i am glad at the very loss of my freedom  
 awful 
it s a hopeless case  
said katavasov 
 well let s drink to his recovery or wish that a hundredth part of his dreams may be realized  and that would be happiness such as never has been seen on earth  
soon after dinner the guests went away to be in time to be dressed for the wedding 
when he was left alone and recalled the conversation of these bachelor friends levin asked himself had he in his heart that regret for his freedom of which they had spoken 
he smiled at the question 
 freedom 
what is freedom for 
happiness is only in loving and wishing her wishes thinking her thoughts that is to say not freedom at all  that s happiness  
 but do i know her ideas her wishes her feelings  
some voice suddenly whispered to him 
the smile died away from his face and he grew thoughtful 
and suddenly a strange feeling came upon him 
there came over him a dread and doubt  doubt of everything 
 what if she does not love me 
what if she s marrying me simply to be married 
what if she doesn t see herself what she s doing  
he asked himself 
 she may come to her senses and only when she is being married realize that she does not and cannot love me  
and strange most evil thoughts of her began to come to him 
he was jealous of vronsky as he had been a year ago as though the evening he had seen her with vronsky had been yesterday 
he suspected she had not told him everything 
he jumped up quickly 
 no this can t go on  
he said to himself in despair 
 i ll go to her i ll ask her i ll say for the last time we are free and hadn t we better stay so 
anything s better than endless misery disgrace unfaithfulness  
with despair in his heart and bitter anger against all men against himself against her he went out of the hotel and drove to her house 
he found her in one of the back rooms 
she was sitting on a chest and making some arrangements with her maid sorting over heaps of dresses of different colors spread on the backs of chairs and on the floor 
 ah  
she cried seeing him and beaming with delight 
 kostya 
konstantin dmitrievitch  
 these latter days she used these names almost alternately  
 i didn t expect you 
i m going through my wardrobe to see what s for whom     oh 
that s very nice  
he said gloomily looking at the maid 
 you can go dunyasha i ll call you presently  said kitty 
 kostya what s the matter  
she asked definitely adopting this familiar name as soon as the maid had gone out 
she noticed his strange face agitated and gloomy and a panic came over her 
 kitty 
i m in torture 
i can t suffer alone  he said with despair in his voice standing before her and looking imploringly into her eyes 
he saw already from her loving truthful face that nothing could come of what he had meant to say but yet he wanted her to reassure him herself 
 i ve come to say that there s still time 
this can all be stopped and set right  
 what 
i don t understand 
what is the matter  
 what i have said a thousand times over and can t help thinking   that i m not worthy of you 
you couldn t consent to marry me 
think a little 
you ve made a mistake 
think it over thoroughly 
you can t love me    
if   better say so  he said not looking at her 
 i shall be wretched 
let people say what they like anything s better than misery     far better now while there s still time      i don t understand  she answered panic stricken you mean you want to give it up   don t want it  
 yes if you don t love me  
 you re out of your mind  
she cried turning crimson with vexation 
but his face was so piteous that she restrained her vexation and flinging some clothes off an arm chair she sat down beside him 
 what are you thinking 
tell me all  
 i am thinking you can t love me 
what can you love me for  
 my god 
what can i do     
she said and burst into tears 
 oh 
what have i done  
he cried and kneeling before her he fell to kissing her hands 
when the princess came into the room five minutes later she found them completely reconciled 
kitty had not simply assured him that she loved him but had gone so far  in answer to his question what she loved him for  as to explain what for 
she told him that she loved him because she understood him completely because she knew what he would like and because everything he liked was good 
and this seemed to him perfectly clear 
when the princess came to them they were sitting side by side on the chest sorting the dresses and disputing over kitty s wanting to give dunyasha the brown dress she had been wearing when levin proposed to her while he insisted that that dress must never be given away but dunyasha must have the blue one 
 how is it you don t see 
she s a brunette and it won t suit her    
i ve worked it all out  
hearing why he had come the princess was half humorously half seriously angry with him and sent him home to dress and not to hinder kitty s hair dressing as charles the hair dresser was just coming 
 as it is she s been eating nothing lately and is losing her looks and then you must come and upset her with your nonsense  she said to him 
 get along with you my dear  
levin guilty and shamefaced but pacified went back to his hotel 
his brother darya alexandrovna and stepan arkadyevitch all in full dress were waiting for him to bless him with the holy picture 
there was no time to lose 
darya alexandrovna had to drive home again to fetch her curled and pomaded son who was to carry the holy pictures after the bride 
then a carriage had to be sent for the best man and another that would take sergey ivanovitch away would have to be sent back    
altogether there were a great many most complicated matters to be considered and arranged 
one thing was unmistakable that there must be no delay as it was already half past six 
nothing special happened at the ceremony of benediction with the holy picture 
stepan arkadyevitch stood in a comically solemn pose beside his wife took the holy picture and telling levin to bow down to the ground he blessed him with his kindly ironical smile and kissed him three times darya alexandrovna did the same and immediately was in a hurry to get off and again plunged into the intricate question of the destinations of the various carriages 
 come i ll tell you how we ll manage you drive in our carriage to fetch him and sergey ivanovitch if he ll be so good will drive there and then send his carriage  
 of course i shall be delighted  
 we ll come on directly with him 
are your things sent off  
said stepan arkadyevitch 
 yes  answered levin and he told kouzma to put out his clothes for him to dress 
chapter    a crowd of people principally women was thronging round the church lighted up for the wedding 
those who had not succeeded in getting into the main entrance were crowding about the windows pushing wrangling and peeping through the gratings 
more than twenty carriages had already been drawn up in ranks along the street by the police 
a police officer regardless of the frost stood at the entrance gorgeous in his uniform 
more carriages were continually driving up and ladies wearing flowers and carrying their trains and men taking off their helmets or black hats kept walking into the church 
inside the church both lusters were already lighted and all the candles before the holy pictures 
the gilt on the red ground of the holy picture stand and the gilt relief on the pictures and the silver of the lusters and candlesticks and the stones of the floor and the rugs and the banners above in the choir and the steps of the altar and the old blackened books and the cassocks and surplices  all were flooded with light 
on the right side of the warm church in the crowd of frock coats and white ties uniforms and broadcloth velvet satin hair and flowers bare shoulders and arms and long gloves there was discreet but lively conversation that echoed strangely in the high cupola 
every time there was heard the creak of the opened door the conversation in the crowd died away and everybody looked round expecting to see the bride and bridegroom come in 
but the door had opened more than ten times and each time it was either a belated guest or guests who joined the circle of the invited on the right or a spectator who had eluded or softened the police officer and went to join the crowd of outsiders on the left 
both the guests and the outside public had by now passed through all the phases of anticipation 
at first they imagined that the bride and bridegroom would arrive immediately and attached no importance at all to their being late 
then they began to look more and more often towards the door and to talk of whether anything could have happened 
then the long delay began to be positively discomforting and relations and guests tried to look as if they were not thinking of the bridegroom but were engrossed in conversation 
the head deacon as though to remind them of the value of his time coughed impatiently making the window panes quiver in their frames 
in the choir the bored choristers could be heard trying their voices and blowing their noses 
the priest was continually sending first the beadle and then the deacon to find out whether the bridegroom had not come more and more often he went himself in a lilac vestment and an embroidered sash to the side door expecting to see the bridegroom 
at last one of the ladies glancing at her watch said it really is strange though  
and all the guests became uneasy and began loudly expressing their wonder and dissatisfaction 
one of the bridegroom s best men went to find out what had happened 
kitty meanwhile had long ago been quite ready and in her white dress and long veil and wreath of orange blossoms she was standing in the drawing room of the shtcherbatskys house with her sister madame lvova who was her bridal mother 
she was looking out of the window and had been for over half an hour anxiously expecting to hear from the best man that her bridegroom was at the church 
levin meanwhile in his trousers but without his coat and waistcoat was walking to and fro in his room at the hotel continually putting his head out of the door and looking up and down the corridor 
but in the corridor there was no sign of the person he was looking for and he came back in despair and frantically waving his hands addressed stepan arkadyevitch who was smoking serenely 
 was ever a man in such a fearful fool s position  
he said 
 yes it is stupid  stepan arkadyevitch assented smiling soothingly 
 but don t worry it ll be brought directly  
 no what is to be done  
said levin with smothered fury 
 and these fools of open waistcoats 
out of the question  
he said looking at the crumpled front of his shirt 
 and what if the things have been taken on to the railway station  
he roared in desperation 
 then you must put on mine  
 i ought to have done so long ago if at all  
 it s not nice to look ridiculous    
wait a bit 
it will come round  
the point was that when levin asked for his evening suit kouzma his old servant had brought him the coat waistcoat and everything that was wanted 
 but the shirt  
cried levin 
 you ve got a shirt on  kouzma answered with a placid smile 
kouzma had not thought of leaving out a clean shirt and on receiving instructions to pack up everything and send it round to the shtcherbatskys house from which the young people were to set out the same evening he had done so packing everything but the dress suit 
the shirt worn since the morning was crumpled and out of the question with the fashionable open waistcoat 
it was a long way to send to the shtcherbatskys  
they sent out to buy a shirt 
the servant came back everything was shut up  it was sunday 
they sent to stepan arkadyevitch s and brought a shirt  it was impossibly wide and short 
they sent finally to the shtcherbatskys to unpack the things 
the bridegroom was expected at the church while he was pacing up and down his room like a wild beast in a cage peeping out into the corridor and with horror and despair recalling what absurd things he had said to kitty and what she might be thinking now 
at last the guilty kouzma flew panting into the room with the shirt 
 only just in time 
they were just lifting it into the van  said kouzma 
three minutes later levin ran full speed into the corridor not looking at his watch for fear of aggravating his sufferings 
 you won t help matters like this  said stepan arkadyevitch with a smile hurrying with more deliberation after him 
 it will come round it will come round   i tell you  
chapter    they ve come  
 here he is  
 which one  
 rather young eh  
 why my dear soul she looks more dead than alive  
were the comments in the crowd when levin meeting his bride in the entrance walked with her into the church 
stepan arkadyevitch told his wife the cause of the delay and the guests were whispering it with smiles to one another 
levin saw nothing and no one he did not take his eyes off his bride 
everyone said she had lost her looks dreadfully of late and was not nearly so pretty on her wedding day as usual but levin did not think so 
he looked at her hair done up high with the long white veil and white flowers and the high stand up scalloped collar that in such a maidenly fashion hid her long neck at the sides and only showed it in front her strikingly slender figure and it seemed to him that she looked better than ever  not because these flowers this veil this gown from paris added anything to her beauty but because in spite of the elaborate sumptuousness of her attire the expression of her sweet face of her eyes of her lips was still her own characteristic expression of guileless truthfulness 
 i was beginning to think you meant to run away  she said and smiled to him 
 it s so stupid what happened to me i m ashamed to speak of it  
he said reddening and he was obliged to turn to sergey ivanovitch who came up to him 
 this is a pretty story of yours about the shirt  
said sergey ivanovitch shaking his head and smiling 
 yes yes  
answered levin without an idea of what they were talking about 
 now kostya you have to decide  said stepan arkadyevitch with an air of mock dismay a weighty question 
you are at this moment just in the humor to appreciate all its gravity 
they ask me are they to light the candles that have been lighted before or candles that have never been lighted 
it s a matter of ten roubles  he added relaxing his lips into a smile 
 i have decided but i was afraid you might not agree  
levin saw it was a joke but he could not smile 
 well how s it to be then   unlighted or lighted candles 
that s the question  
 yes yes unlighted  
 oh i m very glad 
the question s decided  
said stepan arkadyevitch smiling 
 how silly men are though in this position  he said to tchirikov when levin after looking absently at him had moved back to his bride 
 kitty mind you re the first to step on the carpet  said countess nordston coming up 
 you re a nice person  
she said to levin 
 aren t you frightened eh  
said marya dmitrievna an old aunt 
 are you cold 
you re pale 
stop a minute stoop down  said kitty s sister madame lvova and with her plump handsome arms she smilingly set straight the flowers on her head 
dolly came up tried to say something but could not speak cried and then laughed unnaturally 
kitty looked at all of them with the same absent eyes as levin 
meanwhile the officiating clergy had got into their vestments and the priest and deacon came out to the lectern which stood in the forepart of the church 
the priest turned to levin saying something 
levin did not hear what the priest said 
 take the bride s hand and lead her up  the best man said to levin 
it was a long while before levin could make out what was expected of him 
for a long time they tried to set him right and made him begin again  because he kept taking kitty by the wrong arm or with the wrong arm  till he understood at last that what he had to do was without changing his position to take her right hand in his right hand 
when at last he had taken the bride s hand in the correct way the priest walked a few paces in front of them and stopped at the lectern 
the crowd of friends and relations moved after them with a buzz of talk and a rustle of skirts 
someone stooped down and pulled out the bride s train 
the church became so still that the drops of wax could be heard falling from the candles 
the little old priest in his ecclesiastical cap with his long silvery gray locks of hair parted behind his ears was fumbling with something at the lectern putting out his little old hands from under the heavy silver vestment with the gold cross on the back of it 
stepan arkadyevitch approached him cautiously whispered something and making a sign to levin walked back again 
the priest lighted two candles wreathed with flowers and holding them sideways so that the wax dropped slowly from them he turned facing the bridal pair 
the priest was the same old man that had confessed levin 
he looked with weary and melancholy eyes at the bride and bridegroom sighed and putting his right hand out from his vestment blessed the bridegroom with it and also with a shade of solicitous tenderness laid the crossed fingers on the bowed head of kitty 
then he gave them the candles and taking the censer moved slowly away from them 
 can it be true  
thought levin and he looked round at his bride 
looking down at her he saw her face in profile and from the scarcely perceptible quiver of her lips and eyelashes he knew she was aware of his eyes upon her 
she did not look round but the high scalloped collar that reached her little pink ear trembled faintly 
he saw that a sigh was held back in her throat and the little hand in the long glove shook as it held the candle 
all the fuss of the shirt of being late all the talk of friends and relations their annoyance his ludicrous position  all suddenly passed away and he was filled with joy and dread 
the handsome stately head deacon wearing a silver robe and his curly locks standing out at each side of his head stepped smartly forward and lifting his stole on two fingers stood opposite the priest 
 blessed be the name of the lord  the solemn syllables rang out slowly one after another setting the air quivering with waves of sound 
 blessed is the name of our god from the beginning is now and ever shall be  the little old priest answered in a submissive piping voice still fingering something at the lectern 
and the full chorus of the unseen choir rose up filling the whole church from the windows to the vaulted roof with broad waves of melody 
it grew stronger rested for an instant and slowly died away 
they prayed as they always do for peace from on high and for salvation for the holy synod and for the tsar they prayed too for the servants of god konstantin and ekaterina now plighting their troth 
 vouchsafe to them love made perfect peace and help o lord we beseech thee  the whole church seemed to breathe with the voice of the head deacon 
levin heard the words and they impressed him 
 how did they guess that it is help just help that one wants  
he thought recalling all his fears and doubts of late 
 what do i know 
what can i do in this fearful business  he thought without help 
yes it is help i want now  
when the deacon had finished the prayer for the imperial family the priest turned to the bridal pair with a book eternal god that joinest together in love them that were separate  he read in a gentle piping voice who hast ordained the union of holy wedlock that cannot be set asunder thou who didst bless isaac and rebecca and their descendants according to thy holy covenant bless thy servants konstantin and ekaterina leading them in the path of all good works 
for gracious and merciful art thou our lord and glory be to thee the father the son and the holy ghost now and ever shall be  
 amen  
the unseen choir sent rolling again upon the air 
  joinest together in love them that were separate  
what deep meaning in those words and how they correspond with what one feels at this moment  thought levin 
 is she feeling the same as i  
and looking round he met her eyes and from their expression he concluded that she was understanding it just as he was 
but this was a mistake she almost completely missed the meaning of the words of the service she had not heard them in fact 
she could not listen to them and take them in so strong was the one feeling that filled her breast and grew stronger and stronger 
that feeling was joy at the completion of the process that for the last month and a half had been going on in her soul and had during those six weeks been a joy and a torture to her 
on the day when in the drawing room of the house in arbaty street she had gone up to him in her brown dress and given herself to him without a word  on that day at that hour there took place in her heart a complete severance from all her old life and a quite different new utterly strange life had begun for her while the old life was actually going on as before 
those six weeks had for her been a time of the utmost bliss and the utmost misery 
all her life all her desires and hopes were concentrated on this one man still uncomprehended by her to whom she was bound by a feeling of alternate attraction and repulsion even less comprehended than the man himself and all the while she was going on living in the outward conditions of her old life 
living the old life she was horrified at herself at her utter insurmountable callousness to all her own past to things to habits to the people she had loved who loved her  to her mother who was wounded by her indifference to her kind tender father till then dearer than all the world 
at one moment she was horrified at this indifference at another she rejoiced at what had brought her to this indifference 
she could not frame a thought not a wish apart from life with this man but this new life was not yet and she could not even picture it clearly to herself 
there was only anticipation the dread and joy of the new and the unknown 
and now behold  anticipation and uncertainty and remorse at the abandonment of the old life  all was ending and the new was beginning 
this new life could not but have terrors for her inexperience but terrible or not the change had been wrought six weeks before in her soul and this was merely the final sanction of what had long been completed in her heart 
turning again to the lectern the priest with some difficulty took kitty s little ring and asking levin for his hand put it on the first joint of his finger 
 the servant of god konstantin plights his troth to the servant of god ekaterina  
and putting his big ring on kitty s touchingly weak pink little finger the priest said the same thing 
and the bridal pair tried several times to understand what they had to do and each time made some mistake and were corrected by the priest in a whisper 
at last having duly performed the ceremony having signed the rings with the cross the priest handed kitty the big ring and levin the little one 
again they were puzzled and passed the rings from hand to hand still without doing what was expected 
dolly tchirikov and stepan arkadyevitch stepped forward to set them right 
there was an interval of hesitation whispering and smiles but the expression of solemn emotion on the faces of the betrothed pair did not change on the contrary in their perplexity over their hands they looked more grave and deeply moved than before and the smile with which stepan arkadyevitch whispered to them that now they would each put on their own ring died away on his lips 
he had a feeling that any smile would jar on them 
 thou who didst from the beginning create male and female  the priest read after the exchange of rings from thee woman was given to man to be a helpmeet to him and for the procreation of children 
o lord our god who hast poured down the blessings of thy truth according to thy holy covenant upon thy chosen servants our fathers from generation to generation bless thy servants konstantin and ekaterina and make their troth fast in faith and union of hearts and truth and love      levin felt more and more that all his ideas of marriage all his dreams of how he would order his life were mere childishness and that it was something he had not understood hitherto and now understood less than ever though it was being performed upon him 
the lump in his throat rose higher and higher tears that would not be checked came into his eyes 
chapter    in the church there was all  moscow all the friends and relations and  during the ceremony of plighting troth in the brilliantly lighted church there was an incessant flow of discreetly subdued talk in the circle of gaily dressed women and girls and men in white ties frockcoats and uniforms 
the talk was principally kept up by the men while the women were absorbed in watching every detail of the ceremony which always means so much to them 
in the little group nearest to the bride were her two sisters dolly and the other one the self possessed beauty madame lvova who had just arrived from abroad 
 why is it marie s in lilac as bad as black at a wedding  
said madame korsunskaya 
 with her complexion it s the one salvation  responded madame trubetskaya 
 i wonder why they had the wedding in the evening 
it s like shop people     so much prettier 
i was married in the evening too    answered madame korsunskaya and she sighed remembering how charming she had been that day and how absurdly in love her husband was and how different it all was now 
 they say if anyone s best man more than ten times he ll never be married 
i wanted to be for the tenth time but the post was taken  said count siniavin to the pretty princess tcharskaya who had designs on him 
princess tcharskaya only answered with a smile 
she looked at kitty thinking how and when she would stand with count siniavin in kitty s place and how she would remind him then of his joke today 
shtcherbatsky told the old maid of honor madame nikolaeva that he meant to put the crown on kitty s chignon for luck 
 she ought not to have worn a chignon  answered madame nikolaeva who had long ago made up her mind that if the elderly widower she was angling for married her the wedding should be of the simplest 
 i don t like such grandeur  
sergey ivanovitch was talking to darya dmitrievna jestingly assuring her that the custom of going away after the wedding was becoming common because newly married people always felt a little ashamed of themselves 
 your brother may feel proud of himself 
she s a marvel of sweetness 
i believe you re envious  
 oh i ve got over that darya dmitrievna  he answered and a melancholy and serious expression suddenly came over his face 
stepan arkadyevitch was telling his sister in law his joke about divorce 
 the wreath wants setting straight  she answered not hearing him 
 what a pity she s lost her looks so  countess nordston said to madame lvova 
 still he s not worth her little finger is he  
 oh i like him so  not because he s my future  beau frère  answered madame lvova 
 and how well he s behaving 
it s so difficult too to look well in such a position not to be ridiculous 
and he s not ridiculous and not affected one can see he s moved  
 you expected it i suppose  
 almost 
she always cared for him  
 well we shall see which of them will step on the rug first 
i warned kitty  
 it will make no difference  said madame lvova we re all obedient wives it s in our family  
 oh i stepped on the rug before vassily on purpose 
and you dolly  
dolly stood beside them she heard them but she did not answer 
she was deeply moved 
the tears stood in her eyes and she could not have spoken without crying 
she was rejoicing over kitty and levin going back in thought to her own wedding she glanced at the radiant figure of stepan arkadyevitch forgot all the present and remembered only her own innocent love 
she recalled not herself only but all her women friends and acquaintances 
she thought of them on the one day of their triumph when they had stood like kitty under the wedding crown with love and hope and dread in their hearts renouncing the past and stepping forward into the mysterious future 
among the brides that came back to her memory she thought too of her darling anna of whose proposed divorce she had just been hearing 
and she had stood just as innocent in orange flowers and bridal veil 
and now 
 it s terribly strange  she said to herself 
it was not merely the sisters the women friends and female relations of the bride who were following every detail of the ceremony 
women who were quite strangers mere spectators were watching it excitedly holding their breath in fear of losing a single movement or expression of the bride and bridegroom and angrily not answering often not hearing the remarks of the callous men who kept making joking or irrelevant observations 
 why has she been crying 
is she being married against her will  
 against her will to a fine fellow like that 
a prince isn t he  
 is that her sister in the white satin 
just listen how the deacon booms out and fearing her husband   
 are the choristers from tchudovo  
 no from the synod  
 i asked the footman 
he says he s going to take her home to his country place at once 
awfully rich they say 
that s why she s being married to him  
 no they re a well matched pair  
 i say marya vassilievna you were making out those fly away crinolines were not being worn 
just look at her in the puce dress  an ambassador s wife they say she is  how her skirt bounces out from side to side  
 what a pretty dear the bride is  like a lamb decked with flowers 
well say what you will we women feel for our sister  
such were the comments in the crowd of gazing women who had succeeded in slipping in at the church doors 
chapter    when the ceremony of plighting troth was over the beadle spread before the lectern in the middle of the church a piece of pink silken stuff the choir sang a complicated and elaborate psalm in which the bass and tenor sang responses to one another and the priest turning round pointed the bridal pair to the pink silk rug 
though both had often heard a great deal about the saying that the one who steps first on the rug will be the head of the house neither levin nor kitty were capable of recollecting it as they took the few steps towards it 
they did not hear the loud remarks and disputes that followed some maintaining he had stepped on first and others that both had stepped on together 
after the customary questions whether they desired to enter upon matrimony and whether they were pledged to anyone else and their answers which sounded strange to themselves a new ceremony began 
kitty listened to the words of the prayer trying to make out their meaning but she could not 
the feeling of triumph and radiant happiness flooded her soul more and more as the ceremony went on and deprived her of all power of attention 
they prayed endow them with continence and fruitfulness and vouchsafe that their hearts may rejoice looking upon their sons and daughters  
they alluded to god s creation of a wife from adam s rib and for this cause a man shall leave father and mother and cleave unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh  and that this is a great mystery  they prayed that god would make them fruitful and bless them like isaac and rebecca joseph moses and zipporah and that they might look upon their children s children 
 that s all splendid  thought kitty catching the words all that s just as it should be  and a smile of happiness unconsciously reflected in everyone who looked at her beamed on her radiant face 
 put it on quite  voices were heard urging when the priest had put on the wedding crowns and shtcherbatsky his hand shaking in its three button glove held the crown high above her head 
 put it on  
she whispered smiling 
levin looked round at her and was struck by the joyful radiance on her face and unconsciously her feeling infected him 
he too like her felt glad and happy 
they enjoyed hearing the epistle read and the roll of the head deacon s voice at the last verse awaited with such impatience by the outside public 
they enjoyed drinking out of the shallow cup of warm red wine and water and they were still more pleased when the priest flinging back his stole and taking both their hands in his led them round the lectern to the accompaniment of bass voices chanting glory to god  
shtcherbatsky and tchirikov supporting the crowns and stumbling over the bride s train smiling too and seeming delighted at something were at one moment left behind at the next treading on the bridal pair as the priest came to a halt 
the spark of joy kindled in kitty seemed to have infected everyone in the church 
it seemed to levin that the priest and the deacon too wanted to smile just as he did 
taking the crowns off their heads the priest read the last prayer and congratulated the young people 
levin looked at kitty and he had never before seen her look as she did 
she was charming with the new radiance of happiness in her face 
levin longed to say something to her but he did not know whether it was all over 
the priest got him out of his difficulty 
he smiled his kindly smile and said gently kiss your wife and you kiss your husband  and took the candles out of their hands 
levin kissed her smiling lips with timid care gave her his arm and with a new strange sense of closeness walked out of the church 
he did not believe he could not believe that it was true 
it was only when their wondering and timid eyes met that he believed in it because he felt that they were one 
after supper the same night the young people left for the country 
chapter    vronsky and anna had been traveling for three months together in europe 
they had visited venice rome and naples and had just arrived at a small italian town where they meant to stay some time 
a handsome head waiter with thick pomaded hair parted from the neck upwards an evening coat a broad white cambric shirt front and a bunch of trinkets hanging above his rounded stomach stood with his hands in the full curve of his pockets looking contemptuously from under his eyelids while he gave some frigid reply to a gentleman who had stopped him 
catching the sound of footsteps coming from the other side of the entry towards the staircase the head waiter turned round and seeing the russian count who had taken their best rooms he took his hands out of his pockets deferentially and with a bow informed him that a courier had been and that the business about the palazzo had been arranged 
the steward was prepared to sign the agreement 
 ah 
i m glad to hear it  said vronsky 
 is madame at home or not  
 madame has been out for a walk but has returned now  answered the waiter 
vronsky took off his soft wide brimmed hat and passed his handkerchief over his heated brow and hair which had grown half over his ears and was brushed back covering the bald patch on his head 
and glancing casually at the gentleman who still stood there gazing intently at him he would have gone on 
 this gentleman is a russian and was inquiring after you  said the head waiter 
with mingled feelings of annoyance at never being able to get away from acquaintances anywhere and longing to find some sort of diversion from the monotony of his life vronsky looked once more at the gentleman who had retreated and stood still again and at the same moment a light came into the eyes of both 
 golenishtchev  
 vronsky  
it really was golenishtchev a comrade of vronsky s in the corps of pages 
in the corps golenishtchev had belonged to the liberal party he left the corps without entering the army and had never taken office under the government 
vronsky and he had gone completely different ways on leaving the corps and had only met once since 
at that meeting vronsky perceived that golenishtchev had taken up a sort of lofty intellectually liberal line and was consequently disposed to look down upon vronsky s interests and calling in life 
hence vronsky had met him with the chilling and haughty manner he so well knew how to assume the meaning of which was you may like or dislike my way of life that s a matter of the most perfect indifference to me you will have to treat me with respect if you want to know me  
golenishtchev had been contemptuously indifferent to the tone taken by vronsky 
this second meeting might have been expected one would have supposed to estrange them still more 
but now they beamed and exclaimed with delight on recognizing one another 
vronsky would never have expected to be so pleased to see golenishtchev but probably he was not himself aware how bored he was 
he forgot the disagreeable impression of their last meeting and with a face of frank delight held out his hand to his old comrade 
the same expression of delight replaced the look of uneasiness on golenishtchev s face 
 how glad i am to meet you  
said vronsky showing his strong white teeth in a friendly smile 
 i heard the name vronsky but i didn t know which one 
i m very very glad  
 let s go in 
come tell me what you re doing  
 i ve been living here for two years 
i m working  
 ah  
said vronsky with sympathy let s go in  
and with the habit common with russians instead of saying in russian what he wanted to keep from the servants he began to speak in french 
 do you know madame karenina 
we are traveling together 
i am going to see her now  he said in french carefully scrutinizing golenishtchev s face 
 ah 
i did not know though he did know  golenishtchev answered carelessly 
 have you been here long  
he added 
 four days  vronsky answered once more scrutinizing his friend s face intently 
 yes he s a decent fellow and will look at the thing properly  vronsky said to himself catching the significance of golenishtchev s face and the change of subject 
 i can introduce him to anna he looks at it properly  
during those three months that vronsky had spent abroad with anna he had always on meeting new people asked himself how the new person would look at his relations with anna and for the most part in men he had met with the proper way of looking at it 
but if he had been asked and those who looked at it properly had been asked exactly how they did look at it both he and they would have been greatly puzzled to answer 
in reality those who in vronsky s opinion had the proper view had no sort of view at all but behaved in general as well bred persons do behave in regard to all the complex and insoluble problems with which life is encompassed on all sides they behaved with propriety avoiding allusions and unpleasant questions 
they assumed an air of fully comprehending the import and force of the situation of accepting and even approving of it but of considering it superfluous and uncalled for to put all this into words 
vronsky at once divined that golenishtchev was of this class and therefore was doubly pleased to see him 
and in fact golenishtchev s manner to madame karenina when he was taken to call on her was all that vronsky could have desired 
obviously without the slightest effort he steered clear of all subjects which might lead to embarrassment 
he had never met anna before and was struck by her beauty and still more by the frankness with which she accepted her position 
she blushed when vronsky brought in golenishtchev and he was extremely charmed by this childish blush overspreading her candid and handsome face 
but what he liked particularly was the way in which at once as though on purpose that there might be no misunderstanding with an outsider she called vronsky simply alexey and said they were moving into a house they had just taken what was here called a palazzo 
golenishtchev liked this direct and simple attitude to her own position 
looking at anna s manner of simple hearted spirited gaiety and knowing alexey alexandrovitch and vronsky golenishtchev fancied that he understood her perfectly 
he fancied that he understood what she was utterly unable to understand how it was that having made her husband wretched having abandoned him and her son and lost her good name she yet felt full of spirits gaiety and happiness 
 it s in the guide book  said golenishtchev referring to the palazzo vronsky had taken 
 there s a first rate tintoretto there 
one of his latest period  
 i tell you what it s a lovely day let s go and have another look at it  said vronsky addressing anna 
 i shall be very glad to i ll go and put on my hat 
would you say it s hot  
she said stopping short in the doorway and looking inquiringly at vronsky 
and again a vivid flush overspread her face 
vronsky saw from her eyes that she did not know on what terms he cared to be with golenishtchev and so was afraid of not behaving as he would wish 
he looked a long tender look at her 
 no not very  he said 
and it seemed to her that she understood everything most of all that he was pleased with her and smiling to him she walked with her rapid step out at the door 
the friends glanced at one another and a look of hesitation came into both faces as though golenishtchev unmistakably admiring her would have liked to say something about her and could not find the right thing to say while vronsky desired and dreaded his doing so 
 well then  vronsky began to start a conversation of some sort so you re settled here 
you re still at the same work then  
he went on recalling that he had been told golenishtchev was writing something 
 yes i m writing the second part of the  two elements  said golenishtchev coloring with pleasure at the question   that is to be exact i am not writing it yet i am preparing collecting materials 
it will be of far wider scope and will touch on almost all questions 
we in russia refuse to see that we are the heirs of byzantium  and he launched into a long and heated explanation of his views 
vronsky at the first moment felt embarrassed at not even knowing of the first part of the  two elements  of which the author spoke as something well known 
but as golenishtchev began to lay down his opinions and vronsky was able to follow them even without knowing the  two elements  he listened to him with some interest for golenishtchev spoke well 
but vronsky was startled and annoyed by the nervous irascibility with which golenishtchev talked of the subject that engrossed him 
as he went on talking his eyes glittered more and more angrily he was more and more hurried in his replies to imaginary opponents and his face grew more and more excited and worried 
remembering golenishtchev a thin lively good natured and well bred boy always at the head of the class vronsky could not make out the reason of his irritability and he did not like it 
what he particularly disliked was that golenishtchev a man belonging to a good set should put himself on a level with some scribbling fellows with whom he was irritated and angry 
was it worth it 
vronsky disliked it yet he felt that golenishtchev was unhappy and was sorry for him 
unhappiness almost mental derangement was visible on his mobile rather handsome face while without even noticing anna s coming in he went on hurriedly and hotly expressing his views 
when anna came in in her hat and cape and her lovely hand rapidly swinging her parasol and stood beside him it was with a feeling of relief that vronsky broke away from the plaintive eyes of golenishtchev which fastened persistently upon him and with a fresh rush of love looked at his charming companion full of life and happiness 
golenishtchev recovered himself with an effort and at first was dejected and gloomy but anna disposed to feel friendly with everyone as she was at that time soon revived his spirits by her direct and lively manner 
after trying various subjects of conversation she got him upon painting of which he talked very well and she listened to him attentively 
they walked to the house they had taken and looked over it 
 i am very glad of one thing  said anna to golenishtchev when they were on their way back alexey will have a capital  atelier 
you must certainly take that room  she said to vronsky in russian using the affectionately familiar form as though she saw that golenishtchev would become intimate with them in their isolation and that there was no need of reserve before him 
 do you paint  
said golenishtchev turning round quickly to vronsky 
 yes i used to study long ago and now i have begun to do a little  said vronsky reddening 
 he has great talent  said anna with a delighted smile 
 i m no judge of course 
but good judges have said the same  
chapter    anna in that first period of her emancipation and rapid return to  health felt herself unpardonably happy and full of the joy of life 
the thought of her husband s unhappiness did not poison her happiness 
on one side that memory was too awful to be thought of 
on the other side her husband s unhappiness had given her too much happiness to be regretted 
the memory of all that had happened after her illness her reconciliation with her husband its breakdown the news of vronsky s wound his visit the preparations for divorce the departure from her husband s house the parting from her son  all that seemed to her like a delirious dream from which she had waked up alone with vronsky abroad 
the thought of the harm caused to her husband aroused in her a feeling like repulsion and akin to what a drowning man might feel who has shaken off another man clinging to him 
that man did drown 
it was an evil action of course but it was the sole means of escape and better not to brood over these fearful facts 
one consolatory reflection upon her conduct had occurred to her at the first moment of the final rupture and when now she recalled all the past she remembered that one reflection 
 i have inevitably made that man wretched  she thought but i don t want to profit by his misery 
i too am suffering and shall suffer i am losing what i prized above everything  i am losing my good name and my son 
i have done wrong and so i don t want happiness i don t want a divorce and shall suffer from my shame and the separation from my child  
but however sincerely anna had meant to suffer she was not suffering 
shame there was not 
with the tact of which both had such a large share they had succeeded in avoiding russian ladies abroad and so had never placed themselves in a false position and everywhere they had met people who pretended that they perfectly understood their position far better indeed than they did themselves 
separation from the son she loved  even that did not cause her anguish in these early days 
the baby girl  his  child  was so sweet and had so won anna s heart since she was all that was left her that anna rarely thought of her son 
the desire for life waxing stronger with recovered health was so intense and the conditions of life were so new and pleasant that anna felt unpardonably happy 
the more she got to know vronsky the more she loved him 
she loved him for himself and for his love for her 
her complete ownership of him was a continual joy to her 
his presence was always sweet to her 
all the traits of his character which she learned to know better and better were unutterably dear to her 
his appearance changed by his civilian dress was as fascinating to her as though she were some young girl in love 
in everything he said thought and did she saw something particularly noble and elevated 
her adoration of him alarmed her indeed she sought and could not find in him anything not fine 
she dared not show him her sense of her own insignificance beside him 
it seemed to her that knowing this he might sooner cease to love her and she dreaded nothing now so much as losing his love though she had no grounds for fearing it 
but she could not help being grateful to him for his attitude to her and showing that she appreciated it 
he who had in her opinion such a marked aptitude for a political career in which he would have been certain to play a leading part  he had sacrificed his ambition for her sake and never betrayed the slightest regret 
he was more lovingly respectful to her than ever and the constant care that she should not feel the awkwardness of her position never deserted him for a single instant 
he so manly a man never opposed her had indeed with her no will of his own and was anxious it seemed for nothing but to anticipate her wishes 
and she could not but appreciate this even though the very intensity of his solicitude for her the atmosphere of care with which he surrounded her sometimes weighed upon her 
vronsky meanwhile in spite of the complete realization of what he had so long desired was not perfectly happy 
he soon felt that the realization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of the mountain of happiness he had expected 
it showed him the mistake men make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of their desires 
for a time after joining his life to hers and putting on civilian dress he had felt all the delight of freedom in general of which he had known nothing before and of freedom in his love   and he was content but not for long 
he was soon aware that there was springing up in his heart a desire for desires  ennui 
without conscious intention he began to clutch at every passing caprice taking it for a desire and an object 
sixteen hours of the day must be occupied in some way since they were living abroad in complete freedom outside the conditions of social life which filled up time in petersburg 
as for the amusements of bachelor existence which had provided vronsky with entertainment on previous tours abroad they could not be thought of since the sole attempt of the sort had led to a sudden attack of depression in anna quite out of proportion with the cause  a late supper with bachelor friends 
relations with the society of the place  foreign and russian  were equally out of the question owing to the irregularity of their position 
the inspection of objects of interest apart from the fact that everything had been seen already had not for vronsky a russian and a sensible man the immense significance englishmen are able to attach to that pursuit 
and just as the hungry stomach eagerly accepts every object it can get hoping to find nourishment in it vronsky quite unconsciously clutched first at politics then at new books and then at pictures 
as he had from a child a taste for painting and as not knowing what to spend his money on he had begun collecting engravings he came to a stop at painting began to take interest in it and concentrated upon it the unoccupied mass of desires which demanded satisfaction 
he had a ready appreciation of art and probably with a taste for imitating art he supposed himself to have the real thing essential for an artist and after hesitating for some time which style of painting to select  religious historical realistic or genre painting  he set to work to paint 
he appreciated all kinds and could have felt inspired by any one of them but he had no conception of the possibility of knowing nothing at all of any school of painting and of being inspired directly by what is within the soul without caring whether what is painted will belong to any recognized school 
since he knew nothing of this and drew his inspiration not directly from life but indirectly from life embodied in art his inspiration came very quickly and easily and as quickly and easily came his success in painting something very similar to the sort of painting he was trying to imitate 
more than any other style he liked the french  graceful and effective  and in that style he began to paint anna s portrait in italian costume and the portrait seemed to him and to everyone who saw it extremely successful 
chapter    the old neglected palazzo with its lofty carved ceilings and frescoes on the walls with its floors of mosaic with its heavy yellow stuff curtains on the windows with its vases on pedestals and its open fireplaces its carved doors and gloomy reception rooms hung with pictures  this palazzo did much by its very appearance after they had moved into it to confirm in vronsky the agreeable illusion that he was not so much a russian country gentleman a retired army officer as an enlightened amateur and patron of the arts himself a modest artist who had renounced the world his connections and his ambition for the sake of the woman he loved 
the pose chosen by vronsky with their removal into the palazzo was completely successful and having through golenishtchev made acquaintance with a few interesting people for a time he was satisfied 
he painted studies from nature under the guidance of an italian professor of painting and studied mediaeval italian life 
mediaeval italian life so fascinated vronsky that he even wore a hat and flung a cloak over his shoulder in the mediaeval style which indeed was extremely becoming to him 
 here we live and know nothing of what s going on  vronsky said to golenishtchev as he came to see him one morning 
 have you seen mihailov s picture  
he said handing him a russian gazette he had received that morning and pointing to an article on a russian artist living in the very same town and just finishing a picture which had long been talked about and had been bought beforehand 
the article reproached the government and the academy for letting so remarkable an artist be left without encouragement and support 
 i ve seen it  answered golenishtchev 
 of course he s not without talent but it s all in a wrong direction 
it s all the ivanov strauss renan attitude to christ and to religious painting  
 what is the subject of the picture  
asked anna 
 christ before pilate 
christ is represented as a jew with all the realism of the new school  
and the question of the subject of the picture having brought him to one of his favorite theories golenishtchev launched forth into a disquisition on it 
 i can t understand how they can fall into such a gross mistake 
christ always has his definite embodiment in the art of the great masters 
and therefore if they want to depict not god but a revolutionist or a sage let them take from history a socrates a franklin a charlotte corday but not christ 
they take the very figure which cannot be taken for their art and then     and is it true that this mihailov is in such poverty  
asked vronsky thinking that as a russian maecenas it was his duty to assist the artist regardless of whether the picture were good or bad 
 i should say not 
he s a remarkable portrait painter 
have you ever seen his portrait of madame vassiltchikova 
but i believe he doesn t care about painting any more portraits and so very likely he is in want 
i maintain that     couldn t we ask him to paint a portrait of anna arkadyevna  
said vronsky 
 why mine  
said anna 
 after yours i don t want another portrait 
better have one of annie so she called her baby girl  
 here she is  she added looking out of the window at the handsome italian nurse who was carrying the child out into the garden and immediately glancing unnoticed at vronsky 
the handsome nurse from whom vronsky was painting a head for his picture was the one hidden grief in anna s life 
he painted with her as his model admired her beauty and mediaevalism and anna dared not confess to herself that she was afraid of becoming jealous of this nurse and was for that reason particularly gracious and condescending both to her and her little son 
vronsky too glanced out of the window and into anna s eyes and turning at once to golenishtchev he said  do you know this mihailov  
 i have met him 
but he s a queer fish and quite without breeding 
you know one of those uncouth new people one s so often coming across nowadays one of those free thinkers you know who are reared  d emblée  in theories of atheism scepticism and materialism 
in former days  said golenishtchev not observing or not willing to observe that both anna and vronsky wanted to speak in former days the free thinker was a man who had been brought up in ideas of religion law and morality and only through conflict and struggle came to free thought but now there has sprung up a new type of born free thinkers who grow up without even having heard of principles of morality or of religion of the existence of authorities who grow up directly in ideas of negation in everything that is to say savages 
well he s of that class 
he s the son it appears of some moscow butler and has never had any sort of bringing up 
when he got into the academy and made his reputation he tried as he s no fool to educate himself 
and he turned to what seemed to him the very source of culture  the magazines 
in old times you see a man who wanted to educate himself  a frenchman for instance  would have set to work to study all the classics and theologians and tragedians and historiaris and philosophers and you know all the intellectual work that came in his way 
but in our day he goes straight for the literature of negation very quickly assimilates all the extracts of the science of negation and he s ready 
and that s not all  twenty years ago he would have found in that literature traces of conflict with authorities with the creeds of the ages he would have perceived from this conflict that there was something else but now he comes at once upon a literature in which the old creeds do not even furnish matter for discussion but it is stated baldly that there is nothing else  evolution natural selection struggle for existence  and that s all 
in my article i ve     i tell you what  said anna who had for a long while been exchanging wary glances with vronsky and knew that he was not in the least interested in the education of this artist but was simply absorbed by the idea of assisting him and ordering a portrait of him i tell you what  she said resolutely interrupting golenishtchev who was still talking away let s go and see him  
golenishtchev recovered his self possession and readily agreed 
but as the artist lived in a remote suburb it was decided to take the carriage 
an hour later anna with golenishtchev by her side and vronsky on the front seat of the carriage facing them drove up to a new ugly house in the remote suburb 
on learning from the porter s wife who came out to them that mihailov saw visitors at his studio but that at that moment he was in his lodging only a couple of steps off they sent her to him with their cards asking permission to see his picture 
chapter     the artist mihailov was as always at work when the cards of count vronsky and golenishtchev were brought to him 
in the morning he had been working in his studio at his big picture 
on getting home he flew into a rage with his wife for not having managed to put off the landlady who had been asking for money 
 i ve said it to you twenty times don t enter into details 
you re fool enough at all times and when you start explaining things in italian you re a fool three times as foolish  he said after a long dispute 
 don t let it run so long it s not my fault 
if i had the money     leave me in peace for god s sake  
mihailov shrieked with tears in his voice and stopping his ears he went off into his working room the other side of a partition wall and closed the door after him 
 idiotic woman  
he said to himself sat down to the table and opening a portfolio he set to work at once with peculiar fervor at a sketch he had begun 
never did he work with such fervor and success as when things went ill with him and especially when he quarreled with his wife 
 oh 
damn them all  
he thought as he went on working 
he was making a sketch for the figure of a man in a violent rage 
a sketch had been made before but he was dissatisfied with it 
 no that one was better   where is it  
he went back to his wife and scowling and not looking at her asked his eldest little girl where was that piece of paper he had given them 
the paper with the discarded sketch on it was found but it was dirty and spotted with candle grease 
still he took the sketch laid it on his table and moving a little away screwing up his eyes he fell to gazing at it 
all at once he smiled and gesticulated gleefully 
 that s it 
that s it  
he said and at once picking up the pencil he began rapidly drawing 
the spot of tallow had given the man a new pose 
he had sketched this new pose when all at once he recalled the face of a shopkeeper of whom he had bought cigars a vigorous face with a prominent chin and he sketched this very face this chin on to the figure of the man 
he laughed aloud with delight 
the figure from a lifeless imagined thing had become living and such that it could never be changed 
that figure lived and was clearly and unmistakably defined 
the sketch might be corrected in accordance with the requirements of the figure the legs indeed could and must be put differently and the position of the left hand must be quite altered the hair too might be thrown back 
but in making these corrections he was not altering the figure but simply getting rid of what concealed the figure 
he was as it were stripping off the wrappings which hindered it from being distinctly seen 
each new feature only brought out the whole figure in all its force and vigor as it had suddenly come to him from the spot of tallow 
he was carefully finishing the figure when the cards were brought him 
 coming coming  
he went in to his wife 
 come sasha don t be cross  
he said smiling timidly and affectionately at her 
 you were to blame 
i was to blame 
i ll make it all right  
and having made peace with his wife he put on an olive green overcoat with a velvet collar and a hat and went towards his studio 
the successful figure he had already forgotten 
now he was delighted and excited at the visit of these people of consequence russians who had come in their carriage 
of his picture the one that stood now on his easel he had at the bottom of his heart one conviction  that no one had ever painted a picture like it 
he did not believe that his picture was better than all the pictures of raphael but he knew that what he tried to convey in that picture no one ever had conveyed 
this he knew positively and had known a long while ever since he had begun to paint it 
but other people s criticisms whatever they might be had yet immense consequence in his eyes and they agitated him to the depths of his soul 
any remark the most insignificant that showed that the critic saw even the tiniest part of what he saw in the picture agitated him to the depths of his soul 
he always attributed to his critics a more profound comprehension than he had himself and always expected from them something he did not himself see in the picture 
and often in their criticisms he fancied that he had found this 
he walked rapidly to the door of his studio and in spite of his excitement he was struck by the soft light on anna s figure as she stood in the shade of the entrance listening to golenishtchev who was eagerly telling her something while she evidently wanted to look round at the artist 
he was himself unconscious how as he approached them he seized on this impression and absorbed it as he had the chin of the shopkeeper who had sold him the cigars and put it away somewhere to be brought out when he wanted it 
the visitors not agreeably impressed beforehand by golenishtchev s account of the artist were still less so by his personal appearance 
thick set and of middle height with nimble movements with his brown hat olive green coat and narrow trousers  though wide trousers had been a long while in fashion   most of all with the ordinariness of his broad face and the combined expression of timidity and anxiety to keep up his dignity mihailov made an unpleasant impression 
 please step in  he said trying to look indifferent and going into the passage he took a key out of his pocket and opened the door 
chapter    on entering the studio mihailov once more scanned his visitors and noted down in his imagination vronsky s expression too and especially his jaws 
although his artistic sense was unceasingly at work collecting materials although he felt a continually increasing excitement as the moment of criticizing his work drew nearer he rapidly and subtly formed from imperceptible signs a mental image of these three persons 
that fellow golenishtchev was a russian living here 
mihailov did not remember his surname nor where he had met him nor what he had said to him 
he only remembered his face as he remembered all the faces he had ever seen but he remembered too that it was one of the faces laid by in his memory in the immense class of the falsely consequential and poor in expression 
the abundant hair and very open forehead gave an appearance of consequence to the face which had only one expression  a petty childish peevish expression concentrated just above the bridge of the narrow nose 
vronsky and madame karenina must be mihailov supposed distinguished and wealthy russians knowing nothing about art like all those wealthy russians but posing as amateurs and connoisseurs 
 most likely they ve already looked at all the antiques and now they re making the round of the studios of the new people the german humbug and the cracked pre raphaelite english fellow and have only come to me to make the point of view complete  he thought 
he was well acquainted with the way dilettanti have the cleverer they were the worse he found them of looking at the works of contemporary artists with the sole object of being in a position to say that art is a thing of the past and that the more one sees of the new men the more one sees how inimitable the works of the great old masters have remained 
he expected all this he saw it all in their faces he saw it in the careless indifference with which they talked among themselves stared at the lay figures and busts and walked about in leisurely fashion waiting for him to uncover his picture 
but in spite of this while he was turning over his studies pulling up the blinds and taking off the sheet he was in intense excitement especially as in spite of his conviction that all distinguished and wealthy russians were certain to be beasts and fools he liked vronsky and still more anna 
 here if you please  he said moving on one side with his nimble gait and pointing to his picture it s the exhortation to pilate 
matthew chapter xxvii  he said feeling his lips were beginning to tremble with emotion 
he moved away and stood behind them 
for the few seconds during which the visitors were gazing at the picture in silence mihailov too gazed at it with the indifferent eye of an outsider 
for those few seconds he was sure in anticipation that a higher juster criticism would be uttered by them by those very visitors whom he had been so despising a moment before 
he forgot all he had thought about his picture before during the three years he had been painting it he forgot all its qualities which had been absolutely certain to him  he saw the picture with their indifferent new outside eyes and saw nothing good in it 
he saw in the foreground pilate s irritated face and the serene face of christ and in the background the figures of pilate s retinue and the face of john watching what was happening 
every face that with such agony such blunders and corrections had grown up within him with its special character every face that had given him such torments and such raptures and all these faces so many times transposed for the sake of the harmony of the whole all the shades of color and tones that he had attained with such labor  all of this together seemed to him now looking at it with their eyes the merest vulgarity something that had been done a thousand times over 
the face dearest to him the face of christ the center of the picture which had given him such ecstasy as it unfolded itself to him was utterly lost to him when he glanced at the picture with their eyes 
he saw a well painted no not even that  he distinctly saw now a mass of defects repetition of those endless christs of titian raphael rubens and the same soldiers and pilate 
it was all common poor and stale and positively badly painted  weak and unequal 
they would be justified in repeating hypocritically civil speeches in the presence of the painter and pitying him and laughing at him when they were alone again 
the silence though it lasted no more than a minute became too intolerable to him 
to break it and to show he was not agitated he made an effort and addressed golenishtchev 
 i think i ve had the pleasure of meeting you  he said looking uneasily first at anna then at vronsky in fear of losing any shade of their expression 
 to be sure 
we met at rossi s do you remember at that  soirée  when that italian lady recited  the new rachel  
golenishtchev answered easily removing his eyes without the slightest regret from the picture and turning to the artist 
noticing however that mihailov was expecting a criticism of the picture he said  your picture has got on a great deal since i saw it last time and what strikes me particularly now as it did then is the figure of pilate 
one so knows the man a good natured capital fellow but an official through and through who does not know what it is he s doing 
but i fancy     all mihailov s mobile face beamed at once his eyes sparkled 
he tried to say something but he could not speak for excitement and pretended to be coughing 
low as was his opinion of golenishtchev s capacity for understanding art trifling as was the true remark upon the fidelity of the expression of pilate as an official and offensive as might have seemed the utterance of so unimportant an observation while nothing was said of more serious points mihailov was in an ecstasy of delight at this observation 
he had himself thought about pilate s figure just what golenishtchev said 
the fact that this reflection was but one of millions of reflections which as mihailov knew for certain would be true did not diminish for him the significance of golenishtchev s remark 
his heart warmed to golenishtchev for this remark and from a state of depression he suddenly passed to ecstasy 
at once the whole of his picture lived before him in all the indescribable complexity of everything living 
mihailov again tried to say that that was how he understood pilate but his lips quivered intractably and he could not pronounce the words 
vronsky and anna too said something in that subdued voice in which partly to avoid hurting the artist s feelings and partly to avoid saying out loud something silly  so easily said when talking of art  people usually speak at exhibitions of pictures 
mihailov fancied that the picture had made an impression on them too 
he went up to them 
 how marvelous christ s expression is  
said anna 
of all she saw she liked that expression most of all and she felt that it was the center of the picture and so praise of it would be pleasant to the artist 
 one can see that he is pitying pilate  
this again was one of the million true reflections that could be found in his picture and in the figure of christ 
she said that he was pitying pilate 
in christ s expression there ought to be indeed an expression of pity since there is an expression of love of heavenly peace of readiness for death and a sense of the vanity of words 
of course there is the expression of an official in pilate and of pity in christ seeing that one is the incarnation of the fleshly and the other of the spiritual life 
all this and much more flashed into mihailov s thoughts 
 yes and how that figure is done  what atmosphere 
one can walk round it  said golenishtchev unmistakably betraying by this remark that he did not approve of the meaning and idea of the figure 
 yes there s a wonderful mastery  
said vronsky 
 how those figures in the background stand out 
there you have technique  he said addressing golenishtchev alluding to a conversation between them about vronsky s despair of attaining this technique 
 yes yes marvelous  
golenishtchev and anna assented 
in spite of the excited condition in which he was the sentence about technique had sent a pang to mihailov s heart and looking angrily at vronsky he suddenly scowled 
he had often heard this word technique and was utterly unable to understand what was understood by it 
he knew that by this term was understood a mechanical facility for painting or drawing entirely apart from its subject 
he had noticed often that even in actual praise technique was opposed to essential quality as though one could paint well something that was bad 
he knew that a great deal of attention and care was necessary in taking off the coverings to avoid injuring the creation itself and to take off all the coverings but there was no art of painting  no technique of any sort  about it 
if to a little child or to his cook were revealed what he saw it or she would have been able to peel the wrappings off what was seen 
and the most experienced and adroit painter could not by mere mechanical facility paint anything if the lines of the subject were not revealed to him first 
besides he saw that if it came to talking about technique it was impossible to praise him for it 
in all he had painted and repainted he saw faults that hurt his eyes coming from want of care in taking off the wrappings  faults he could not correct now without spoiling the whole 
and in almost all the figures and faces he saw too remnants of the wrappings not perfectly removed that spoiled the picture 
 one thing might be said if you will allow me to make the remark    observed golenishtchev 
 oh i shall be delighted i beg you  said mihailov with a forced smile 
 that is that you make him the man god and not the god man 
but i know that was what you meant to do  
 i cannot paint a christ that is not in my heart  said mihailov gloomily 
 yes but in that case if you will allow me to say what i think    
your picture is so fine that my observation cannot detract from it and besides it is only my personal opinion 
with you it is different 
your very motive is different 
but let us take ivanov 
i imagine that if christ is brought down to the level of an historical character it would have been better for ivanov to select some other historical subject fresh untouched  
 but if this is the greatest subject presented to art  
 if one looked one would find others 
but the point is that art cannot suffer doubt and discussion 
and before the picture of ivanov the question arises for the believer and the unbeliever alike is it god or is it not god  
and the unity of the impression is destroyed  
 why so 
i think that for educated people  said mihailov the question cannot exist  
golenishtchev did not agree with this and confounded mihailov by his support of his first idea of the unity of the impression being essential to art 
mihailov was greatly perturbed but he could say nothing in defense of his own idea 
chapter    anna and vronsky had long been exchanging glances regretting their friend s flow of cleverness 
at last vronsky without waiting for the artist walked away to another small picture 
 oh how exquisite 
what a lovely thing 
a gem 
how exquisite  
they cried with one voice 
 what is it they re so pleased with  
thought mihailov 
he had positively forgotten that picture he had painted three years ago 
he had forgotten all the agonies and the ecstasies he had lived through with that picture when for several months it had been the one thought haunting him day and night 
he had forgotten as he always forgot the pictures he had finished 
he did not even like to look at it and had only brought it out because he was expecting an englishman who wanted to buy it 
 oh that s only an old study  he said 
 how fine  
said golenishtchev he too with unmistakable sincerity falling under the spell of the picture 
two boys were angling in the shade of a willow tree 
the elder had just dropped in the hook and was carefully pulling the float from behind a bush entirely absorbed in what he was doing 
the other a little younger was lying in the grass leaning on his elbows with his tangled flaxen head in his hands staring at the water with his dreamy blue eyes 
what was he thinking of 
the enthusiasm over this picture stirred some of the old feeling for it in mihailov but he feared and disliked this waste of feeling for things past and so even though this praise was grateful to him he tried to draw his visitors away to a third picture 
but vronsky asked whether the picture was for sale 
to mihailov at that moment excited by visitors it was extremely distasteful to speak of money matters 
 it is put up there to be sold  he answered scowling gloomily 
when the visitors had gone mihailov sat down opposite the picture of pilate and christ and in his mind went over what had been said and what though not said had been implied by those visitors 
and strange to say what had had such weight with him while they were there and while he mentally put himself at their point of view suddenly lost all importance for him 
he began to look at his picture with all his own full artist vision and was soon in that mood of conviction of the perfectibility and so of the significance of his picture  a conviction essential to the most intense fervor excluding all other interests  in which alone he could work 
christ s foreshortened leg was not right though 
he took his palette and began to work 
as he corrected the leg he looked continually at the figure of john in the background which his visitors had not even noticed but which he knew was beyond perfection 
when he had finished the leg he wanted to touch that figure but he felt too much excited for it 
he was equally unable to work when he was cold and when he was too much affected and saw everything too much 
there was only one stage in the transition from coldness to inspiration at which work was possible 
today he was too much agitated 
he would have covered the picture but he stopped holding the cloth in his hand and smiling blissfully gazed a long while at the figure of john 
at last as it were regretfully tearing himself away he dropped the cloth and exhausted but happy went home 
vronsky anna and golenishtchev on their way home were particularly lively and cheerful 
they talked of mihailov and his pictures 
the word  talent  by which they meant an inborn almost physical aptitude apart from brain and heart and in which they tried to find an expression for all the artist had gained from life recurred particularly often in their talk as though it were necessary for them to sum up what they had no conception of though they wanted to talk of it 
they said that there was no denying his talent but that his talent could not develop for want of education  the common defect of our russian artists 
but the picture of the boys had imprinted itself on their memories and they were continually coming back to it 
 what an exquisite thing 
how he has succeeded in it and how simply 
he doesn t even comprehend how good it is 
yes i mustn t let it slip i must buy it  said vronsky 
chapter    mihailov sold vronsky his picture and agreed to paint a portrait of anna 
on the day fixed he came and began the work 
from the fifth sitting the portrait impressed everyone especially vronsky not only by its resemblance but by its characteristic beauty 
it was strange how mihailov could have discovered just her characteristic beauty 
 one needs to know and love her as i have loved her to discover the very sweetest expression of her soul  vronsky thought though it was only from this portrait that he had himself learned this sweetest expression of her soul 
but the expression was so true that he and others too fancied they had long known it 
 i have been struggling on for ever so long without doing anything  he said of his own portrait of her and he just looked and painted it 
that s where technique comes in  
 that will come  was the consoling reassurance given him by golenishtchev in whose view vronsky had both talent and what was most important culture giving him a wider outlook on art 
golenishtchev s faith in vronsky s talent was propped up by his own need of vronsky s sympathy and approval for his own articles and ideas and he felt that the praise and support must be mutual 
in another man s house and especially in vronsky s palazzo mihailov was quite a different man from what he was in his studio 
he behaved with hostile courtesy as though he were afraid of coming closer to people he did not respect 
he called vronsky your excellency  and notwithstanding anna s and vronsky s invitations he would never stay to dinner nor come except for the sittings 
anna was even more friendly to him than to other people and was very grateful for her portrait 
vronsky was more than cordial with him and was obviously interested to know the artist s opinion of his picture 
golenishtchev never let slip an opportunity of instilling sound ideas about art into mihailov 
but mihailov remained equally chilly to all of them 
anna was aware from his eyes that he liked looking at her but he avoided conversation with her 
vronsky s talk about his painting he met with stubborn silence and he was as stubbornly silent when he was shown vronsky s picture 
he was unmistakably bored by golenishtchev s conversation and he did not attempt to oppose him 
altogether mihailov with his reserved and disagreeable as it were hostile attitude was quite disliked by them as they got to know him better and they were glad when the sittings were over and they were left with a magnificent portrait in their possession and he gave up coming 
golenishtchev was the first to give expression to an idea that had occurred to all of them which was that mihailov was simply jealous of vronsky 
 not envious let us say since he has  talent  but it annoys him that a wealthy man of the highest society and a count too you know they all detest a title  can without any particular trouble do as well if not better than he who has devoted all his life to it 
and more than all it s a question of culture which he is without  
vronsky defended mihailov but at the bottom of his heart he believed it because in his view a man of a different lower world would be sure to be envious 
anna s portrait  the same subject painted from nature both by him and by mihailov  ought to have shown vronsky the difference between him and mihailov but he did not see it 
only after mihailov s portrait was painted he left off painting his portrait of anna deciding that it was now not needed 
his picture of mediaeval life he went on with 
and he himself and golenishtchev and still more anna thought it very good because it was far more like the celebrated pictures they knew than mihailov s picture 
mihailov meanwhile although anna s portrait greatly fascinated him was even more glad than they were when the sittings were over and he had no longer to listen to golenishtchev s disquisitions upon art and could forget about vronsky s painting 
he knew that vronsky could not be prevented from amusing himself with painting he knew that he and all dilettanti had a perfect right to paint what they liked but it was distasteful to him 
a man could not be prevented from making himself a big wax doll and kissing it 
but if the man were to come with the doll and sit before a man in love and begin caressing his doll as the lover caressed the woman he loved it would be distasteful to the lover 
just such a distasteful sensation was what mihailov felt at the sight of vronsky s painting he felt it both ludicrous and irritating both pitiable and offensive 
vronsky s interest in painting and the middle ages did not last long 
he had enough taste for painting to be unable to finish his picture 
the picture came to a standstill 
he was vaguely aware that its defects inconspicuous at first would be glaring if he were to go on with it 
the same experience befell him as golenishtchev who felt that he had nothing to say and continually deceived himself with the theory that his idea was not yet mature that he was working it out and collecting materials 
this exasperated and tortured golenishtchev but vronsky was incapable of deceiving and torturing himself and even more incapable of exasperation 
with his characteristic decision without explanation or apology he simply ceased working at painting 
but without this occupation the life of vronsky and of anna who wondered at his loss of interest in it struck them as intolerably tedious in an italian town 
the palazzo suddenly seemed so obtrusively old and dirty the spots on the curtains the cracks in the floors the broken plaster on the cornices became so disagreeably obvious and the everlasting sameness of golenishtchev and the italian professor and the german traveler became so wearisome that they had to make some change 
they resolved to go to russia to the country 
in petersburg vronsky intended to arrange a partition of the land with his brother while anna meant to see her son 
the summer they intended to spend on vronsky s great family estate 
chapter    levin had been married three months 
he was happy but not at all in the way he had expected to be 
at every step he found his former dreams disappointed and new unexpected surprises of happiness 
he was happy but on entering upon family life he saw at every step that it was utterly different from what he had imagined 
at every step he experienced what a man would experience who after admiring the smooth happy course of a little boat on a lake should get himself into that little boat 
he saw that it was not all sitting still floating smoothly that one had to think too not for an instant to forget where one was floating and that there was water under one and that one must row and that his unaccustomed hands would be sore and that it was only to look at it that was easy but that doing it though very delightful was very difficult 
as a bachelor when he had watched other people s married life seen the petty cares the squabbles the jealousy he had only smiled contemptuously in his heart 
in his future married life there could be he was convinced nothing of that sort even the external forms indeed he fancied must be utterly unlike the life of others in everything 
and all of a sudden instead of his life with his wife being made on an individual pattern it was on the contrary entirely made up of the pettiest details which he had so despised before but which now by no will of his own had gained an extraordinary importance that it was useless to contend against 
and levin saw that the organization of all these details was by no means so easy as he had fancied before 
although levin believed himself to have the most exact conceptions of domestic life unconsciously like all men he pictured domestic life as the happiest enjoyment of love with nothing to hinder and no petty cares to distract 
he ought as he conceived the position to do his work and to find repose from it in the happiness of love 
she ought to be beloved and nothing more 
but like all men he forgot that she too would want work 
and he was surprised that she his poetic exquisite kitty could not merely in the first weeks but even in the first days of their married life think remember and busy herself about tablecloths and furniture about mattresses for visitors about a tray about the cook and the dinner and so on 
while they were still engaged he had been struck by the definiteness with which she had declined the tour abroad and decided to go into the country as though she knew of something she wanted and could still think of something outside her love 
this had jarred upon him then and now her trivial cares and anxieties jarred upon him several times 
but he saw that this was essential for her 
and loving her as he did though he did not understand the reason of them and jeered at these domestic pursuits he could not help admiring them 
he jeered at the way in which she arranged the furniture they had brought from moscow rearranged their room hung up curtains prepared rooms for visitors a room for dolly saw after an abode for her new maid ordered dinner of the old cook came into collision with agafea mihalovna taking from her the charge of the stores 
he saw how the old cook smiled admiring her and listening to her inexperienced impossible orders how mournfully and tenderly agafea mihalovna shook her head over the young mistress s new arrangements 
he saw that kitty was extraordinarily sweet when laughing and crying she came to tell him that her maid masha was used to looking upon her as her young lady and so no one obeyed her 
it seemed to him sweet but strange and he thought it would have been better without this 
he did not know how great a sense of change she was experiencing she who at home had sometimes wanted some favorite dish or sweets without the possibility of getting either now could order what she liked buy pounds of sweets spend as much money as she liked and order any puddings she pleased 
she was dreaming with delight now of dolly s coming to them with her children especially because she would order for the children their favorite puddings and dolly would appreciate all her new housekeeping 
she did not know herself why and wherefore but the arranging of her house had an irresistible attraction for her 
instinctively feeling the approach of spring and knowing that there would be days of rough weather too she built her nest as best she could and was in haste at the same time to build it and to learn how to do it 
this care for domestic details in kitty so opposed to levin s ideal of exalted happiness was at first one of the disappointments and this sweet care of her household the aim of which he did not understand but could not help loving was one of the new happy surprises 
another disappointment and happy surprise came in their quarrels 
levin could never have conceived that between him and his wife any relations could arise other than tender respectful and loving and all at once in the very early days they quarreled so that she said he did not care for her that he cared for no one but himself burst into tears and wrung her arms 
this first quarrel arose from levin s having gone out to a new farmhouse and having been away half an hour too long because he had tried to get home by a short cut and had lost his way 
he drove home thinking of nothing but her of her love of his own happiness and the nearer he drew to home the warmer was his tenderness for her 
he ran into the room with the same feeling with an even stronger feeling than he had had when he reached the shtcherbatskys house to make his offer 
and suddenly he was met by a lowering expression he had never seen in her 
he would have kissed her she pushed him away 
 what is it  
 you ve been enjoying yourself  she began trying to be calm and spiteful 
but as soon as she opened her mouth a stream of reproach of senseless jealousy of all that had been torturing her during that half hour which she had spent sitting motionless at the window burst from her 
it was only then for the first time that he clearly understood what he had not understood when he led her out of the church after the wedding 
he felt now that he was not simply close to her but that he did not know where he ended and she began 
he felt this from the agonizing sensation of division that he experienced at that instant 
he was offended for the first instant but the very same second he felt that he could not be offended by her that she was himself 
he felt for the first moment as a man feels when having suddenly received a violent blow from behind he turns round angry and eager to avenge himself to look for his antagonist and finds that it is he himself who has accidentally struck himself that there is no one to be angry with and that he must put up with and try to soothe the pain 
never afterwards did he feel it with such intensity but this first time he could not for a long while get over it 
his natural feeling urged him to defend himself to prove to her she was wrong but to prove her wrong would mean irritating her still more and making the rupture greater that was the cause of all his suffering 
one habitual feeling impelled him to get rid of the blame and to pass it on to her 
another feeling even stronger impelled him as quickly as possible to smooth over the rupture without letting it grow greater 
to remain under such undeserved reproach was wretched but to make her suffer by justifying himself was worse still 
like a man half awake in an agony of pain he wanted to tear out to fling away the aching place and coming to his senses he felt that the aching place was himself 
he could do nothing but try to help the aching place to bear it and this he tried to do 
they made peace 
she recognizing that she was wrong though she did not say so became tenderer to him and they experienced new redoubled happiness in their love 
but that did not prevent such quarrels from happening again and exceedingly often too on the most unexpected and trivial grounds 
these quarrels frequently arose from the fact that they did not yet know what was of importance to each other and that all this early period they were both often in a bad temper 
when one was in a good temper and the other in a bad temper the peace was not broken but when both happened to be in an ill humor quarrels sprang up from such incomprehensibly trifling causes that they could never remember afterwards what they had quarreled about 
it is true that when they were both in a good temper their enjoyment of life was redoubled 
but still this first period of their married life was a difficult time for them 
during all this early time they had a peculiarly vivid sense of tension as it were a tugging in opposite directions of the chain by which they were bound 
altogether their honeymoon  that is to say the month after their wedding  from which from tradition levin expected so much was not merely not a time of sweetness but remained in the memories of both as the bitterest and most humiliating period in their lives 
they both alike tried in later life to blot out from their memories all the monstrous shameful incidents of that morbid period when both were rarely in a normal frame of mind both were rarely quite themselves 
it was only in the third month of their married life after their return from moscow where they had been staying for a month that their life began to go more smoothly 
chapter    they had just come back from moscow and were glad to be alone 
he was sitting at the writing table in his study writing 
she wearing the dark lilac dress she had worn during the first days of their married life and put on again today a dress particularly remembered and loved by him was sitting on the sofa the same old fashioned leather sofa which had always stood in the study in levin s father s and grandfather s days 
she was sewing at  broderie anglaise 
he thought and wrote never losing the happy consciousness of her presence 
his work both on the land and on the book in which the principles of the new land system were to be laid down had not been abandoned but just as formerly these pursuits and ideas had seemed to him petty and trivial in comparison with the darkness that overspread all life now they seemed as unimportant and petty in comparison with the life that lay before him suffused with the brilliant light of happiness 
he went on with his work but he felt now that the center of gravity of his attention had passed to something else and that consequently he looked at his work quite differently and more clearly 
formerly this work had been for him an escape from life 
formerly he had felt that without this work his life would be too gloomy 
now these pursuits were necessary for him that life might not be too uniformly bright 
taking up his manuscript reading through what he had written he found with pleasure that the work was worth his working at 
many of his old ideas seemed to him superfluous and extreme but many blanks became distinct to him when he reviewed the whole thing in his memory 
he was writing now a new chapter on the causes of the present disastrous condition of agriculture in russia 
he maintained that the poverty of russia arises not merely from the anomalous distribution of landed property and misdirected reforms but that what had contributed of late years to this result was the civilization from without abnormally grafted upon russia especially facilities of communication as railways leading to centralization in towns the development of luxury and the consequent development of manufactures credit and its accompaniment of speculation  all to the detriment of agriculture 
it seemed to him that in a normal development of wealth in a state all these phenomena would arise only when a considerable amount of labor had been put into agriculture when it had come under regular or at least definite conditions that the wealth of a country ought to increase proportionally and especially in such a way that other sources of wealth should not outstrip agriculture that in harmony with a certain stage of agriculture there should be means of communication corresponding to it and that in our unsettled condition of the land railways called into being by political and not by economic needs were premature and instead of promoting agriculture as was expected of them they were competing with agriculture and promoting the development of manufactures and credit and so arresting its progress and that just as the one sided and premature development of one organ in an animal would hinder its general development so in the general development of wealth in russia credit facilities of communication manufacturing activity indubitably necessary in europe where they had arisen in their proper time had with us only done harm by throwing into the background the chief question calling for settlement  the question of the organization of agriculture 
while he was writing his ideas she was thinking how unnaturally cordial her husband had been to young prince tcharsky who had with great want of tact flirted with her the day before they left moscow 
 he s jealous  she thought 
 goodness 
how sweet and silly he is 
he s jealous of me 
if he knew that i think no more of them than of piotr the cook  she thought looking at his head and red neck with a feeling of possession strange to herself 
 though it s a pity to take him from his work but he has plenty of time 
  i must look at his face will he feel i m looking at him 
i wish he d turn round   i ll  will  him to  
and she opened her eyes wide as though to intensify the influence of her gaze 
 yes they draw away all the sap and give a false appearance of prosperity  he muttered stopping to write and feeling that she was looking at him and smiling he looked round 
 well  
he queried smiling and getting up 
 he looked round  she thought 
 it s nothing i wanted you to look round  she said watching him and trying to guess whether he was vexed at being interrupted or not 
 how happy we are alone together   i am that is  he said going up to her with a radiant smile of happiness 
 i m just as happy 
i ll never go anywhere especially not to moscow  
 and what were you thinking about  
 i 
i was thinking     no no go along go on writing don t break off  she said pursing up her lips and i must cut out these little holes now do you see  
she took up her scissors and began cutting them out 
 no tell me what was it  
he said sitting down beside her and watching the tiny scissors moving round 
 oh 
what was i thinking about 
i was thinking about moscow about the back of your head  
 why should i of all people have such happiness 
it s unnatural too good  he said kissing her hand 
 i feel quite the opposite the better things are the more natural it seems to me  
 and you ve got a little curl loose  he said carefully turning her head round 
 a little curl oh yes 
no no we are busy at our work  
work did not progress further and they darted apart from one another like culprits when kouzma came in to announce that tea was ready 
 have they come from the town  
levin asked kouzma 
 they ve just come they re unpacking the things  
 come quickly  she said to him as she went out of the study or else i shall read your letters without you  
left alone after putting his manuscripts together in the new portfolio bought by her he washed his hands at the new washstand with the elegant fittings that had all made their appearance with her 
levin smiled at his own thoughts and shook his head disapprovingly at those thoughts a feeling akin to remorse fretted him 
there was something shameful effeminate capuan as he called it to himself in his present mode of life 
 it s not right to go on like this  he thought 
 it ll soon be three months and i m doing next to nothing 
today almost for the first time i set to work seriously and what happened 
i did nothing but begin and throw it aside 
even my ordinary pursuits i have almost given up 
on the land i scarcely walk or drive about at all to look after things 
either i am loath to leave her or i see she s dull alone 
and i used to think that before marriage life was nothing much somehow didn t count but that after marriage life began in earnest 
and here almost three months have passed and i have spent my time so idly and unprofitably 
no this won t do i must begin 
of course it s not her fault 
she s not to blame in any way 
i ought myself to be firmer to maintain my masculine independence of action or else i shall get into such ways and she ll get used to them too     of course she s not to blame  he told himself 
but it is hard for anyone who is dissatisfied not to blame someone else and especially the person nearest of all to him for the ground of his dissatisfaction 
and it vaguely came into levin s mind that she herself was not to blame she could not be to blame for anything  but what was to blame was her education too superficial and frivolous 
  that fool tcharsky she wanted i know to stop him but didn t know how to   
 yes apart from her interest in the house that she has  apart from dress and broderie anglaise  she has no serious interests 
no interest in her work in the estate in the peasants nor in music though she s rather good at it nor in reading 
she does nothing and is perfectly satisfied  
levin in his heart censured this and did not as yet understand that she was preparing for that period of activity which was to come for her when she would at once be the wife of her husband and mistress of the house and would bear and nurse and bring up children 
he knew not that she was instinctively aware of this and preparing herself for this time of terrible toil did not reproach herself for the moments of carelessness and happiness in her love that she enjoyed now while gaily building her nest for the future 
chapter    when levin went upstairs his wife was sitting near the new silver samovar behind the new tea service and having settled old agafea mihalovna at a little table with a full cup of tea was reading a letter from dolly with whom they were in continual and frequent correspondence 
 you see your good lady s settled me here told me to sit a bit with her  said agafea mihalovna smiling affectionately at kitty 
in these words of agafea mihalovna levin read the final act of the drama which had been enacted of late between her and kitty 
he saw that in spite of agafea mihalovna s feelings being hurt by a new mistress taking the reins of government out of her hands kitty had yet conquered her and made her love her 
 here i opened your letter too  said kitty handing him an illiterate letter 
 it s from that woman i think your brother s    she said 
 i did not read it through 
this is from my people and from dolly 
fancy 
dolly took tanya and grisha to a children s ball at the sarmatskys  tanya was a french marquise  
but levin did not hear her 
flushing he took the letter from marya nikolaevna his brother s former mistress and began to read it 
this was the second letter he had received from marya nikolaevna 
in the first letter marya nikolaevna wrote that his brother had sent her away for no fault of hers and with touching simplicity added that though she was in want again she asked for nothing and wished for nothing but was only tormented by the thought that nikolay dmitrievitch would come to grief without her owing to the weak state of his health and begged his brother to look after him 
now she wrote quite differently 
she had found nikolay dmitrievitch had again made it up with him in moscow and had moved with him to a provincial town where he had received a post in the government service 
but that he had quarreled with the head official and was on his way back to moscow only he had been taken so ill on the road that it was doubtful if he would ever leave his bed again she wrote 
 it s always of you he has talked and besides he has no more money left  
 read this dolly writes about you  kitty was beginning with a smile but she stopped suddenly noticing the changed expression on her husband s face 
 what is it 
what s the matter  
 she writes to me that nikolay my brother is at death s door 
i shall go to him  
kitty s face changed at once 
thoughts of tanya as a marquise of dolly all had vanished 
 when are you going  
she said 
 tomorrow  
 and i will go with you can i  
she said 
 kitty 
what are you thinking of  
he said reproachfully 
 how do you mean  
offended that he should seem to take her suggestion unwillingly and with vexation 
 why shouldn t i go 
i shan t be in your way 
i     i m going because my brother is dying  said levin 
 why should you     why 
for the same reason as you  
 and at a moment of such gravity for me she only thinks of her being dull by herself  thought levin 
and this lack of candor in a matter of such gravity infuriated him 
 it s out of the question  he said sternly 
agafea mihalovna seeing that it was coming to a quarrel gently put down her cup and withdrew 
kitty did not even notice her 
the tone in which her husband had said the last words wounded her especially because he evidently did not believe what she had said 
 i tell you that if you go i shall come with you i shall certainly come  she said hastily and wrathfully 
 why out of the question 
why do you say it s out of the question  
 because it ll be going god knows where by all sorts of roads and to all sorts of hotels 
you would be a hindrance to me  said levin trying to be cool 
 not at all 
i don t want anything 
where you can go i can      well for one thing then because this woman s there whom you can t meet  
 i don t know and don t care to know who s there and what 
i know that my husband s brother is dying and my husband is going to him and i go with my husband too      kitty 
don t get angry 
but just think a little this is a matter of such importance that i can t bear to think that you should bring in a feeling of weakness of dislike to being left alone 
come you ll be dull alone so go and stay at moscow a little  
 there you always ascribe base vile motives to me  she said with tears of wounded pride and fury 
 i didn t mean it wasn t weakness it wasn t   i feel that it s my duty to be with my husband when he s in trouble but you try on purpose to hurt me you try on purpose not to understand      no this is awful 
to be such a slave  
cried levin getting up and unable to restrain his anger any longer 
but at the same second he felt that he was beating himself 
 then why did you marry 
you could have been free 
why did you if you regret it  
she said getting up and running away into the drawing room 
when he went to her she was sobbing 
he began to speak trying to find words not to dissuade but simply to soothe her 
but she did not heed him and would not agree to anything 
he bent down to her and took her hand which resisted him 
he kissed her hand kissed her hair kissed her hand again  still she was silent 
but when he took her face in both his hands and said kitty  
she suddenly recovered herself and began to cry and they were reconciled 
it was decided that they should go together the next day 
levin told his wife that he believed she wanted to go simply in order to be of use agreed that marya nikolaevna s being with his brother did not make her going improper but he set off at the bottom of his heart dissatisfied both with her and with himself 
he was dissatisfied with her for being unable to make up her mind to let him go when it was necessary and how strange it was for him to think that he so lately hardly daring to believe in such happiness as that she could love him  now was unhappy because she loved him too much 
  and he was dissatisfied with himself for not showing more strength of will 
even greater was the feeling of disagreement at the bottom of his heart as to her not needing to consider the woman who was with his brother and he thought with horror of all the contingencies they might meet with 
the mere idea of his wife his kitty being in the same room with a common wench set him shuddering with horror and loathing 
chapter    the hotel of the provincial town where nikolay levin was lying ill was one of those provincial hotels which are constructed on the newest model of modern improvements with the best intentions of cleanliness comfort and even elegance but owing to the public that patronizes them are with astounding rapidity transformed into filthy taverns with a pretension of modern improvement that only makes them worse than the old fashioned honestly filthy hotels 
this hotel had already reached that stage and the soldier in a filthy uniform smoking in the entry supposed to stand for a hall porter and the cast iron slippery dark and disagreeable staircase and the free and easy waiter in a filthy frock coat and the common dining room with a dusty bouquet of wax flowers adorning the table and filth dust and disorder everywhere and at the same time the sort of modern up to date self complacent railway uneasiness of this hotel aroused a most painful feeling in levin after their fresh young life especially because the impression of falsity made by the hotel was so out of keeping with what awaited them 
as is invariably the case after they had been asked at what price they wanted rooms it appeared that there was not one decent room for them one decent room had been taken by the inspector of railroads another by a lawyer from moscow a third by princess astafieva from the country 
there remained only one filthy room next to which they promised that another should be empty by the evening 
feeling angry with his wife because what he had expected had come to pass which was that at the moment of arrival when his heart throbbed with emotion and anxiety to know how his brother was getting on he should have to be seeing after her instead of rushing straight to his brother levin conducted her to the room assigned them 
 go do go  
she said looking at him with timid and guilty eyes 
he went out of the door without a word and at once stumbled over marya nikolaevna who had heard of his arrival and had not dared to go in to see him 
she was just the same as when he saw her in moscow the same woolen gown and bare arms and neck and the same good naturedly stupid pockmarked face only a little plumper 
 well how is he 
how is he  
 very bad 
he can t get up 
he has kept expecting you 
he    are you   with your wife  
levin did not for the first moment understand what it was confused her but she immediately enlightened him 
 i ll go away 
i ll go down to the kitchen  she brought out 
 nikolay dmitrievitch will be delighted 
he heard about it and knows your lady and remembers her abroad  
levin realized that she meant his wife and did not know what answer to make 
 come along come along to him  
he said 
but as soon as he moved the door of his room opened and kitty peeped out 
levin crimsoned both from shame and anger with his wife who had put herself and him in such a difficult position but marya nikolaevna crimsoned still more 
she positively shrank together and flushed to the point of tears and clutching the ends of her apron in both hands twisted them in her red fingers without knowing what to say and what to do 
for the first instant levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the eyes with which kitty looked at this awful woman so incomprehensible to her but it lasted only a single instant 
 well 
how is he  
she turned to her husband and then to her 
 but one can t go on talking in the passage like this  
levin said looking angrily at a gentleman who walked jauntily at that instant across the corridor as though about his affairs 
 well then come in  said kitty turning to marya nikolaevna who had recovered herself but noticing her husband s face of dismay or go on go and then come for me  she said and went back into the room 
levin went to his brother s room 
he had not in the least expected what he saw and felt in his brother s room 
he had expected to find him in the same state of self deception which he had heard was so frequent with the consumptive and which had struck him so much during his brother s visit in the autumn 
he had expected to find the physical signs of the approach of death more marked  greater weakness greater emaciation but still almost the same condition of things 
he had expected himself to feel the same distress at the loss of the brother he loved and the same horror in face of death as he had felt then only in a greater degree 
and he had prepared himself for this but he found something utterly different 
in a little dirty room with the painted panels of its walls filthy with spittle and conversation audible through the thin partition from the next room in a stifling atmosphere saturated with impurities on a bedstead moved away from the wall there lay covered with a quilt a body 
one arm of this body was above the quilt and the wrist huge as a rake handle was attached inconceivably it seemed to the thin long bone of the arm smooth from the beginning to the middle 
the head lay sideways on the pillow 
levin could see the scanty locks wet with sweat on the temples and tense transparent looking forehead 
 it cannot be that that fearful body was my brother nikolay  
thought levin 
but he went closer saw the face and doubt became impossible 
in spite of the terrible change in the face levin had only to glance at those eager eyes raised at his approach only to catch the faint movement of the mouth under the sticky mustache to realize the terrible truth that this death like body was his living brother 
the glittering eyes looked sternly and reproachfully at his brother as he drew near 
and immediately this glance established a living relationship between living men 
levin immediately felt the reproach in the eyes fixed on him and felt remorse at his own happiness 
when konstantin took him by the hand nikolay smiled 
the smile was faint scarcely perceptible and in spite of the smile the stern expression of the eyes was unchanged 
 you did not expect to find me like this  he articulated with effort 
 yes   no  said levin hesitating over his words 
 how was it you didn t let me know before that is at the time of my wedding 
i made inquiries in all directions  
he had to talk so as not to be silent and he did not know what to say especially as his brother made no reply and simply stared without dropping his eyes and evidently penetrated to the inner meaning of each word 
levin told his brother that his wife had come with him 
nikolay expressed pleasure but said he was afraid of frightening her by his condition 
a silence followed 
suddenly nikolay stirred and began to say something 
levin expected something of peculiar gravity and importance from the expression of his face but nikolay began speaking of his health 
he found fault with the doctor regretting he had not a celebrated moscow doctor 
levin saw that he still hoped 
seizing the first moment of silence levin got up anxious to escape if only for an instant from his agonizing emotion and said that he would go and fetch his wife 
 very well and i ll tell her to tidy up here 
it s dirty and stinking here i expect 
marya 
clear up the room  the sick man said with effort 
 oh and when you ve cleared up go away yourself  he added looking inquiringly at his brother 
levin made no answer 
going out into the corridor he stopped short 
he had said he would fetch his wife but now taking stock of the emotion he was feeling he decided that he would try on the contrary to persuade her not to go in to the sick man 
 why should she suffer as i am suffering  
he thought 
 well how is he  
kitty asked with a frightened face 
 oh it s awful it s awful 
what did you come for  
said levin 
kitty was silent for a few seconds looking timidly and ruefully at her husband then she went up and took him by the elbow with both hands 
 kostya 
take me to him it will be easier for us to bear it together 
you only take me take me to him please and go away  she said 
 you must understand that for me to see you and not to see him is far more painful 
there i might be a help to you and to him 
please let me  
she besought her husband as though the happiness of her life depended on it 
levin was obliged to agree and regaining his composure and completely forgetting about marya nikolaevna by now he went again in to his brother with kitty 
stepping lightly and continually glancing at her husband showing him a valorous and sympathetic face kitty went into the sick room and turning without haste noiselessly closed the door 
with inaudible steps she went quickly to the sick man s bedside and going up so that he had not to turn his head she immediately clasped in her fresh young hand the skeleton of his huge hand pressed it and began speaking with that soft eagerness sympathetic and not jarring which is peculiar to women 
 we have met though we were not acquainted at soden  she said 
 you never thought i was to be your sister  
 you would not have recognized me  
he said with a radiant smile at her entrance 
 yes i should 
what a good thing you let us know 
not a day has passed that kostya has not mentioned you and been anxious  
but the sick man s interest did not last long 
before she had finished speaking there had come back into his face the stern reproachful expression of the dying man s envy of the living 
 i am afraid you are not quite comfortable here  she said turning away from his fixed stare and looking about the room 
 we must ask about another room  she said to her husband so that we might be nearer  
chapter    levin could not look calmly at his brother he could not himself be natural and calm in his presence 
when he went in to the sick man his eyes and his attention were unconsciously dimmed and he did not see and did not distinguish the details of his brother s position 
he smelt the awful odor saw the dirt disorder and miserable condition and heard the groans and felt that nothing could be done to help 
it never entered his head to analyze the details of the sick man s situation to consider how that body was lying under the quilt how those emaciated legs and thighs and spine were lying huddled up and whether they could not be made more comfortable whether anything could not be done to make things if not better at least less bad 
it made his blood run cold when he began to think of all these details 
he was absolutely convinced that nothing could be done to prolong his brother s life or to relieve his suffering 
but a sense of his regarding all aid as out of the question was felt by the sick man and exasperated him 
and this made it still more painful for levin 
to be in the sick room was agony to him not to be there still worse 
and he was continually on various pretexts going out of the room and coming in again because he was unable to remain alone 
but kitty thought and felt and acted quite differently 
on seeing the sick man she pitied him 
and pity in her womanly heart did not arouse at all that feeling of horror and loathing that it aroused in her husband but a desire to act to find out all the details of his state and to remedy them 
and since she had not the slightest doubt that it was her duty to help him she had no doubt either that it was possible and immediately set to work 
the very details the mere thought of which reduced her husband to terror immediately engaged her attention 
she sent for the doctor sent to the chemist s set the maid who had come with her and marya nikolaevna to sweep and dust and scrub she herself washed up something washed out something else laid something under the quilt 
something was by her directions brought into the sick room something else was carried out 
she herself went several times to her room regardless of the men she met in the corridor got out and brought in sheets pillow cases towels and shirts 
the waiter who was busy with a party of engineers dining in the dining hall came several times with an irate countenance in answer to her summons and could not avoid carrying out her orders as she gave them with such gracious insistence that there was no evading her 
levin did not approve of all this he did not believe it would be of any good to the patient 
above all he feared the patient would be angry at it 
but the sick man though he seemed and was indifferent about it was not angry but only abashed and on the whole as it were interested in what she was doing with him 
coming back from the doctor to whom kitty had sent him levin on opening the door came upon the sick man at the instant when by kitty s directions they were changing his linen 
the long white ridge of his spine with the huge prominent shoulder blades and jutting ribs and vertebrae was bare and marya nikolaevna and the waiter were struggling with the sleeve of the night shirt and could not get the long limp arm into it 
kitty hurriedly closing the door after levin was not looking that way but the sick man groaned and she moved rapidly towards him 
 make haste  she said 
 oh don t you come  said the sick man angrily 
 i ll do it my myself      what say  
queried marya nikolaevna 
but kitty heard and saw he was ashamed and uncomfortable at being naked before her 
 i m not looking i m not looking  
she said putting the arm in 
 marya nikolaevna you come this side you do it  she added 
 please go for me there s a little bottle in my small bag  she said turning to her husband you know in the side pocket bring it please and meanwhile they ll finish clearing up here  
returning with the bottle levin found the sick man settled comfortably and everything about him completely changed 
the heavy smell was replaced by the smell of aromatic vinegar which kitty with pouting lips and puffed out rosy cheeks was squirting through a little pipe 
there was no dust visible anywhere a rug was laid by the bedside 
on the table stood medicine bottles and decanters tidily arranged and the linen needed was folded up there and kitty s  broderie anglaise 
on the other table by the patient s bed there were candles and drink and powders 
the sick man himself washed and combed lay in clean sheets on high raised pillows in a clean night shirt with a white collar about his astoundingly thin neck and with a new expression of hope looked fixedly at kitty 
the doctor brought by levin and found by him at the club was not the one who had been attending nikolay levin as the patient was dissatisfied with him 
the new doctor took up a stethoscope and sounded the patient shook his head prescribed medicine and with extreme minuteness explained first how to take the medicine and then what diet was to be kept to 
he advised eggs raw or hardly cooked and seltzer water with warm milk at a certain temperature 
when the doctor had gone away the sick man said something to his brother of which levin could distinguish only the last words your katya  
by the expression with which he gazed at her levin saw that he was praising her 
he called indeed to katya as he called her 
 i m much better already  he said 
 why with you i should have got well long ago 
how nice it is  
he took her hand and drew it towards his lips but as though afraid she would dislike it he changed his mind let it go and only stroked it 
kitty took his hand in both hers and pressed it 
 now turn me over on the left side and go to bed  he said 
no one could make out what he said but kitty she alone understood 
she understood because she was all the while mentally keeping watch on what he needed 
 on the other side  she said to her husband he always sleeps on that side 
turn him over it s so disagreeable calling the servants 
i m not strong enough 
can you  
she said to marya nikolaevna 
 i m afraid not  answered marya nikolaevna 
terrible as it was to levin to put his arms round that terrible body to take hold of that under the quilt of which he preferred to know nothing under his wife s influence he made his resolute face that she knew so well and putting his arms into the bed took hold of the body but in spite of his own strength he was struck by the strange heaviness of those powerless limbs 
while he was turning him over conscious of the huge emaciated arm about his neck kitty swiftly and noiselessly turned the pillow beat it up and settled in it the sick man s head smoothing back his hair which was sticking again to his moist brow 
the sick man kept his brother s hand in his own 
levin felt that he meant to do something with his hand and was pulling it somewhere 
levin yielded with a sinking heart yes he drew it to his mouth and kissed it 
levin shaking with sobs and unable to articulate a word went out of the room 
chapter    thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes  
so levin thought about his wife as he talked to her that evening 
levin thought of the text not because he considered himself wise and prudent  
he did not so consider himself but he could not help knowing that he had more intellect than his wife and agafea mihalovna and he could not help knowing that when he thought of death he thought with all the force of his intellect 
he knew too that the brains of many great men whose thoughts he had read had brooded over death and yet knew not a hundredth part of what his wife and agafea mihalovna knew about it 
different as those two women were agafea mihalovna and katya as his brother nikolay had called her and as levin particularly liked to call her now they were quite alike in this 
both knew without a shade of doubt what sort of thing life was and what was death and though neither of them could have answered and would even not have understood the questions that presented themselves to levin both had no doubt of the significance of this event and were precisely alike in their way of looking at it which they shared with millions of people 
the proof that they knew for a certainty the nature of death lay in the fact that they knew without a second of hesitation how to deal with the dying and were not frightened of them 
levin and other men like him though they could have said a great deal about death obviously did not know this since they were afraid of death and were absolutely at a loss what to do when people were dying 
if levin had been alone now with his brother nikolay he would have looked at him with terror and with still greater terror waited and would not have known what else to do 
more than that he did not know what to say how to look how to move 
to talk of outside things seemed to him shocking impossible to talk of death and depressing subjects  also impossible 
to be silent also impossible 
 if i look at him he will think i am studying him i am afraid if i don t look at him he ll think i m thinking of other things 
if i walk on tiptoe he will be vexed to tread firmly i m ashamed  
kitty evidently did not think of herself and had no time to think about herself she was thinking about him because she knew something and all went well 
she told him about herself even and about her wedding and smiled and sympathized with him and petted him and talked of cases of recovery and all went well so then she must know 
the proof that her behavior and agafea mihalovna s was not instinctive animal irrational was that apart from the physical treatment the relief of suffering both agafea mihalovna and kitty required for the dying man something else more important than the physical treatment and something which had nothing in common with physical conditions 
agafea mihalovna speaking of the man just dead had said well thank god he took the sacrament and received absolution god grant each one of us such a death  
katya in just the same way besides all her care about linen bedsores drink found time the very first day to persuade the sick man of the necessity of taking the sacrament and receiving absolution 
on getting back from the sick room to their own two rooms for the night levin sat with hanging head not knowing what to do 
not to speak of supper of preparing for bed of considering what they were going to do he could not even talk to his wife he was ashamed to 
kitty on the contrary was more active than usual 
she was even livelier than usual 
she ordered supper to be brought herself unpacked their things and herself helped to make the beds and did not even forget to sprinkle them with persian powder 
she showed that alertness that swiftness of reflection comes out in men before a battle in conflict in the dangerous and decisive moments of life  those moments when a man shows once and for all his value and that all his past has not been wasted but has been a preparation for these moments 
everything went rapidly in her hands and before it was twelve o clock all their things were arranged cleanly and tidily in her rooms in such a way that the hotel rooms seemed like home the beds were made brushes combs looking glasses were put out table napkins were spread 
levin felt that it was unpardonable to eat to sleep to talk even now and it seemed to him that every movement he made was unseemly 
she arranged the brushes but she did it all so that there was nothing shocking in it 
they could neither of them eat however and for a long while they could not sleep and did not even go to bed 
 i am very glad i persuaded him to receive extreme unction tomorrow  she said sitting in her dressing jacket before her folding looking glass combing her soft fragrant hair with a fine comb 
 i have never seen it but i know mamma has told me there are prayers said for recovery  
 do you suppose he can possibly recover  
said levin watching a slender tress at the back of her round little head that was continually hidden when she passed the comb through the front 
 i asked the doctor he said he couldn t live more than three days 
but can they be sure 
i m very glad anyway that i persuaded him  she said looking askance at her husband through her hair 
 anything is possible  she added with that peculiar rather sly expression that was always in her face when she spoke of religion 
since their conversation about religion when they were engaged neither of them had ever started a discussion of the subject but she performed all the ceremonies of going to church saying her prayers and so on always with the unvarying conviction that this ought to be so 
in spite of his assertion to the contrary she was firmly persuaded that he was as much a christian as she and indeed a far better one and all that he said about it was simply one of his absurd masculine freaks just as he would say about her  broderie anglaise  that good people patch holes but that she cut them on purpose and so on 
 yes you see this woman marya nikolaevna did not know how to manage all this  said levin 
 and   i must own i m very very glad you came 
you are such purity that      he took her hand and did not kiss it to kiss her hand in such closeness to death seemed to him improper  he merely squeezed it with a penitent air looking at her brightening eyes 
 it would have been miserable for you to be alone  she said and lifting her hands which hid her cheeks flushing with pleasure twisted her coil of hair on the nape of her neck and pinned it there 
 no  she went on she did not know how     luckily i learned a lot at soden  
 surely there are not people there so ill  
 worse  
 what s so awful to me is that i can t see him as he was when he was young 
you would not believe how charming he was as a youth but i did not understand him then  
 i can quite quite believe it 
how i feel that we might have been friends  
she said and distressed at what she had said she looked round at her husband and tears came into her eyes 
 yes  might have been  he said mournfully 
 he s just one of those people of whom they say they re not for this world  
 but we have many days before us we must go to bed  said kitty glancing at her tiny watch 
chapter    the next day the sick man received the sacrament and extreme unction 
during the ceremony nikolay levin prayed fervently 
his great eyes fastened on the holy image that was set out on a card table covered with a colored napkin expressed such passionate prayer and hope that it was awful to levin to see it 
levin knew that this passionate prayer and hope would only make him feel more bitterly parting from the life he so loved 
levin knew his brother and the workings of his intellect he knew that his unbelief came not from life being easier for him without faith but had grown up because step by step the contemporary scientific interpretation of natural phenomena crushed out the possibility of faith and so he knew that his present return was not a legitimate one brought about by way of the same working of his intellect but simply a temporary interested return to faith in a desperate hope of recovery 
levin knew too that kitty had strengthened his hope by accounts of the marvelous recoveries she had heard of 
levin knew all this and it was agonizingly painful to him to behold the supplicating hopeful eyes and the emaciated wrist lifted with difficulty making the sign of the cross on the tense brow and the prominent shoulders and hollow gasping chest which one could not feel consistent with the life the sick man was praying for 
during the sacrament levin did what he an unbeliever had done a thousand times 
he said addressing god if thou dost exist make this man to recover of course this same thing has been repeated many times  and thou wilt save him and me  
after extreme unction the sick man became suddenly much better 
he did not cough once in the course of an hour smiled kissed kitty s hand thanking her with tears and said he was comfortable free from pain and that he felt strong and had an appetite 
he even raised himself when his soup was brought and asked for a cutlet as well 
hopelessly ill as he was obvious as it was at the first glance that he could not recover levin and kitty were for that hour both in the same state of excitement happy though fearful of being mistaken 
 is he better  
 yes much  
 it s wonderful  
 there s nothing wonderful in it  
 anyway he s better  they said in a whisper smiling to one another 
this self deception was not of long duration 
the sick man fell into a quiet sleep but he was waked up half an hour later by his cough 
and all at once every hope vanished in those about him and in himself 
the reality of his suffering crushed all hopes in levin and kitty and in the sick man himself leaving no doubt no memory even of past hopes 
without referring to what he had believed in half an hour before as though ashamed even to recall it he asked for iodine to inhale in a bottle covered with perforated paper 
levin gave him the bottle and the same look of passionate hope with which he had taken the sacrament was now fastened on his brother demanding from him the confirmation of the doctor s words that inhaling iodine worked wonders 
 is katya not here  
he gasped looking round while levin reluctantly assented to the doctor s words 
 no so i can say it    
it was for her sake i went through that farce 
she s so sweet but you and i can t deceive ourselves 
this is what i believe in  he said and squeezing the bottle in his bony hand he began breathing over it 
at eight o clock in the evening levin and his wife were drinking tea in their room when marya nikolaevna ran in to them breathlessly 
she was pale and her lips were quivering 
 he is dying  
she whispered 
 i m afraid will die this minute  
both of them ran to him 
he was sitting raised up with one elbow on the bed his long back bent and his head hanging low 
 how do you feel  
levin asked in a whisper after a silence 
 i feel i m setting off  nikolay said with difficulty but with extreme distinctness screwing the words out of himself 
he did not raise his head but simply turned his eyes upwards without their reaching his brother s face 
 katya go away  
he added 
levin jumped up and with a peremptory whisper made her go out 
 i m setting off  he said again 
 why do you think so  
said levin so as to say something 
 because i m setting off  he repeated as though he had a liking for the phrase 
 it s the end  
marya nikolaevna went up to him 
 you had better lie down you d be easier  she said 
 i shall lie down soon enough  he pronounced slowly when i m dead  he said sarcastically wrathfully 
 well you can lay me down if you like  
levin laid his brother on his back sat down beside him and gazed at his face holding his breath 
the dying man lay with closed eyes but the muscles twitched from time to time on his forehead as with one thinking deeply and intensely 
levin involuntarily thought with him of what it was that was happening to him now but in spite of all his mental efforts to go along with him he saw by the expression of that calm stern face that for the dying man all was growing clearer and clearer that was still as dark as ever for levin 
 yes yes so  the dying man articulated slowly at intervals 
 wait a little  
he was silent 
 right  
he pronounced all at once reassuringly as though all were solved for him 
 o lord  
he murmured and sighed deeply 
marya nikolaevna felt his feet 
 they re getting cold  she whispered 
for a long while a very long while it seemed to levin the sick man lay motionless 
but he was still alive and from time to time he sighed 
levin by now was exhausted from mental strain 
he felt that with no mental effort could he understand what it was that was  right 
he could not even think of the problem of death itself but with no will of his own thoughts kept coming to him of what he had to do next closing the dead man s eyes dressing him ordering the coffin 
and strange to say he felt utterly cold and was not conscious of sorrow nor of loss less still of pity for his brother 
if he had any feeling for his brother at that moment it was envy for the knowledge the dying man had now that he could not have 
a long time more he sat over him so continually expecting the end 
but the end did not come 
the door opened and kitty appeared 
levin got up to stop her 
but at the moment he was getting up he caught the sound of the dying man stirring 
 don t go away  said nikolay and held out his hand 
levin gave him his and angrily waved to his wife to go away 
with the dying man s hand in his hand he sat for half an hour an hour another hour 
he did not think of death at all now 
he wondered what kitty was doing who lived in the next room whether the doctor lived in a house of his own 
he longed for food and for sleep 
he cautiously drew away his hand and felt the feet 
the feet were cold but the sick man was still breathing 
levin tried again to move away on tiptoe but the sick man stirred again and said don t go  
         the dawn came the sick man s condition was unchanged 
levin stealthily withdrew his hand and without looking at the dying man went off to his own room and went to sleep 
when he woke up instead of news of his brother s death which he expected he learned that the sick man had returned to his earlier condition 
he had begun sitting up again coughing had begun eating again talking again and again had ceased to talk of death again had begun to express hope of his recovery and had become more irritable and more gloomy than ever 
no one neither his brother nor kitty could soothe him 
he was angry with everyone and said nasty things to everyone reproached everyone for his sufferings and insisted that they should get him a celebrated doctor from moscow 
to all inquiries made him as to how he felt he made the same answer with an expression of vindictive reproachfulness i m suffering horribly intolerably  
the sick man was suffering more and more especially from bedsores which it was impossible now to remedy and grew more and more angry with everyone about him blaming them for everything and especially for not having brought him a doctor from moscow 
kitty tried in every possible way to relieve him to soothe him but it was all in vain and levin saw that she herself was exhausted both physically and morally though she would not admit it 
the sense of death which had been evoked in all by his taking leave of life on the night when he had sent for his brother was broken up 
everyone knew that he must inevitably die soon that he was half dead already 
everyone wished for nothing but that he should die as soon as possible and everyone concealing this gave him medicines tried to find remedies and doctors and deceived him and themselves and each other 
all this was falsehood disgusting irreverent deceit 
and owing to the bent of his character and because he loved the dying man more than anyone else did levin was most painfully conscious of this deceit 
levin who had long been possessed by the idea of reconciling his brothers at least in face of death had written to his brother sergey ivanovitch and having received an answer from him he read this letter to the sick man 
sergey ivanovitch wrote that he could not come himself and in touching terms he begged his brother s forgiveness 
the sick man said nothing 
 what am i to write to him  
said levin 
 i hope you are not angry with him  
 no not the least  
nikolay answered vexed at the question 
 tell him to send me a doctor  
three more days of agony followed the sick man was still in the same condition 
the sense of longing for his death was felt by everyone now at the mere sight of him by the waiters and the hotel keeper and all the people staying in the hotel and the doctor and marya nikolaevna and levin and kitty 
the sick man alone did not express this feeling but on the contrary was furious at their not getting him doctors and went on taking medicine and talking of life 
only at rare moments when the opium gave him an instant s relief from the never ceasing pain he would sometimes half asleep utter what was ever more intense in his heart than in all the others oh if it were only the end  
or when will it be over  
his sufferings steadily growing more intense did their work and prepared him for death 
there was no position in which he was not in pain there was not a minute in which he was unconscious of it not a limb not a part of his body that did not ache and cause him agony 
even the memories the impressions the thoughts of this body awakened in him now the same aversion as the body itself 
the sight of other people their remarks his own reminiscences everything was for him a source of agony 
those about him felt this and instinctively did not allow themselves to move freely to talk to express their wishes before him 
all his life was merged in the one feeling of suffering and desire to be rid of it 
there was evidently coming over him that revulsion that would make him look upon death as the goal of his desires as happiness 
hitherto each individual desire aroused by suffering or privation such as hunger fatigue thirst had been satisfied by some bodily function giving pleasure 
but now no physical craving or suffering received relief and the effort to relieve them only caused fresh suffering 
and so all desires were merged in one  the desire to be rid of all his sufferings and their source the body 
but he had no words to express this desire of deliverance and so he did not speak of it and from habit asked for the satisfaction of desires which could not now be satisfied 
 turn me over on the other side  he would say and immediately after he would ask to be turned back again as before 
 give me some broth 
take away the broth 
talk of something why are you silent  
and directly they began to talk he would close his eyes and would show weariness indifference and loathing 
on the tenth day from their arrival at the town kitty was unwell 
she suffered from headache and sickness and she could not get up all the morning 
the doctor opined that the indisposition arose from fatigue and excitement and prescribed rest 
after dinner however kitty got up and went as usual with her work to the sick man 
he looked at her sternly when she came in and smiled contemptuously when she said she had been unwell 
that day he was continually blowing his nose and groaning piteously 
 how do you feel  
she asked him 
 worse  he articulated with difficulty 
 in pain  
 in pain where  
 everywhere  
 it will be over today you will see  said marya nikolaevna 
though it was said in a whisper the sick man whose hearing levin had noticed was very keen must have heard 
levin said hush to her and looked round at the sick man 
nikolay had heard but these words produced no effect on him 
his eyes had still the same intense reproachful look 
 why do you think so  
levin asked her when she had followed him into the corridor 
 he has begun picking at himself  said marya nikolaevna 
 how do you mean  
 like this  she said tugging at the folds of her woolen skirt 
levin noticed indeed that all that day the patient pulled at himself as it were trying to snatch something away 
marya nikolaevna s prediction came true 
towards night the sick man was not able to lift his hands and could only gaze before him with the same intensely concentrated expression in his eyes 
even when his brother or kitty bent over him so that he could see them he looked just the same 
kitty sent for the priest to read the prayer for the dying 
while the priest was reading it the dying man did not show any sign of life his eyes were closed 
levin kitty and marya nikolaevna stood at the bedside 
the priest had not quite finished reading the prayer when the dying man stretched sighed and opened his eyes 
the priest on finishing the prayer put the cross to the cold forehead then slowly returned it to the stand and after standing for two minutes more in silence he touched the huge bloodless hand that was turning cold 
 he is gone  said the priest and would have moved away but suddenly there was a faint stir in the mustaches of the dead man that seemed glued together and quite distinctly in the hush they heard from the bottom of the chest the sharply defined sounds  not quite   soon  
and a minute later the face brightened a smile came out under the mustaches and the women who had gathered round began carefully laying out the corpse 
the sight of his brother and the nearness of death revived in levin that sense of horror in face of the insoluble enigma together with the nearness and inevitability of death that had come upon him that autumn evening when his brother had come to him 
this feeling was now even stronger than before even less than before did he feel capable of apprehending the meaning of death and its inevitability rose up before him more terrible than ever 
but now thanks to his wife s presence that feeling did not reduce him to despair 
in spite of death he felt the need of life and love 
he felt that love saved him from despair and that this love under the menace of despair had become still stronger and purer 
the one mystery of death still unsolved had scarcely passed before his eyes when another mystery had arisen as insoluble urging him to love and to life 
the doctor confirmed his suppositions in regard to kitty 
her indisposition was a symptom that she was with child 
chapter    from the moment when alexey alexandrovitch understood from his interviews with betsy and with stepan arkadyevitch that all that was expected of him was to leave his wife in peace without burdening her with his presence and that his wife herself desired this he felt so distraught that he could come to no decision of himself he did not know himself what he wanted now and putting himself in the hands of those who were so pleased to interest themselves in his affairs he met everything with unqualified assent 
it was only when anna had left his house and the english governess sent to ask him whether she should dine with him or separately that for the first time he clearly comprehended his position and was appalled by it 
most difficult of all in this position was the fact that he could not in any way connect and reconcile his past with what was now 
it was not the past when he had lived happily with his wife that troubled him 
the transition from that past to a knowledge of his wife s unfaithfulness he had lived through miserably already that state was painful but he could understand it 
if his wife had then on declaring to him her unfaithfulness left him he would have been wounded unhappy but he would not have been in the hopeless position  incomprehensible to himself  in which he felt himself now 
he could not now reconcile his immediate past his tenderness his love for his sick wife and for the other man s child with what was now the case that is with the fact that as it were in return for all this he now found himself alone put to shame a laughing stock needed by no one and despised by everyone 
for the first two days after his wife s departure alexey alexandrovitch received applicants for assistance and his chief secretary drove to the committee and went down to dinner in the dining room as usual 
without giving himself a reason for what he was doing he strained every nerve of his being for those two days simply to preserve an appearance of composure and even of indifference 
answering inquiries about the disposition of anna arkadyevna s rooms and belongings he had exercised immense self control to appear like a man in whose eyes what had occurred was not unforeseen nor out of the ordinary course of events and he attained his aim no one could have detected in him signs of despair 
but on the second day after her departure when korney gave him a bill from a fashionable draper s shop which anna had forgotten to pay and announced that the clerk from the shop was waiting alexey alexandrovitch told him to show the clerk up 
 excuse me your excellency for venturing to trouble you 
but if you direct us to apply to her excellency would you graciously oblige us with her address  
alexey alexandrovitch pondered as it seemed to the clerk and all at once turning round he sat down at the table 
letting his head sink into his hands he sat for a long while in that position several times attempted to speak and stopped short 
korney perceiving his master s emotion asked the clerk to call another time 
left alone alexey alexandrovitch recognized that he had not the strength to keep up the line of firmness and composure any longer 
he gave orders for the carriage that was awaiting him to be taken back and for no one to be admitted and he did not go down to dinner 
he felt that he could not endure the weight of universal contempt and exasperation which he had distinctly seen in the face of the clerk and of korney and of everyone without exception whom he had met during those two days 
he felt that he could not turn aside from himself the hatred of men because that hatred did not come from his being bad in that case he could have tried to be better  but from his being shamefully and repulsively unhappy 
he knew that for this for the very fact that his heart was torn with grief they would be merciless to him 
he felt that men would crush him as dogs strangle a torn dog yelping with pain 
he knew that his sole means of security against people was to hide his wounds from them and instinctively he tried to do this for two days but now he felt incapable of keeping up the unequal struggle 
his despair was even intensified by the consciousness that he was utterly alone in his sorrow 
in all petersburg there was not a human being to whom he could express what he was feeling who would feel for him not as a high official not as a member of society but simply as a suffering man indeed he had not such a one in the whole world 
alexey alexandrovitch grew up an orphan 
there were two brothers 
they did not remember their father and their mother died when alexey alexandrovitch was ten years old 
the property was a small one 
their uncle karenin a government official of high standing at one time a favorite of the late tsar had brought them up 
on completing his high school and university courses with medals alexey alexandrovitch had with his uncle s aid immediately started in a prominent position in the service and from that time forward he had devoted himself exclusively to political ambition 
in the high school and the university and afterwards in the service alexey alexandrovitch had never formed a close friendship with anyone 
his brother had been the person nearest to his heart but he had a post in the ministry of foreign affairs and was always abroad where he had died shortly after alexey alexandrovitch s marriage 
while he was governor of a province anna s aunt a wealthy provincial lady had thrown him  middle aged as he was though young for a governor  with her niece and had succeeded in putting him in such a position that he had either to declare himself or to leave the town 
alexey alexandrovitch was not long in hesitation 
there were at the time as many reasons for the step as against it and there was no overbalancing consideration to outweigh his invariable rule of abstaining when in doubt 
but anna s aunt had through a common acquaintance insinuated that he had already compromised the girl and that he was in honor bound to make her an offer 
he made the offer and concentrated on his betrothed and his wife all the feeling of which he was capable 
the attachment he felt to anna precluded in his heart every need of intimate relations with others 
and now among all his acquaintances he had not one friend 
he had plenty of so called connections but no friendships 
alexey alexandrovitch had plenty of people whom he could invite to dinner to whose sympathy he could appeal in any public affair he was concerned about whose interest he could reckon upon for anyone he wished to help with whom he could candidly discuss other people s business and affairs of state 
but his relations with these people were confined to one clearly defined channel and had a certain routine from which it was impossible to depart 
there was one man a comrade of his at the university with whom he had made friends later and with whom he could have spoken of a personal sorrow but this friend had a post in the department of education in a remote part of russia 
of the people in petersburg the most intimate and most possible were his chief secretary and his doctor 
mihail vassilievitch sludin the chief secretary was a straightforward intelligent good hearted and conscientious man and alexey alexandrovitch was aware of his personal goodwill 
but their five years of official work together seemed to have put a barrier between them that cut off warmer relations 
after signing the papers brought him alexey alexandrovitch had sat for a long while in silence glancing at mihail vassilievitch and several times he attempted to speak but could not 
he had already prepared the phrase you have heard of my trouble  
but he ended by saying as usual so you ll get this ready for me  
and with that dismissed him 
the other person was the doctor who had also a kindly feeling for him but there had long existed a taciturn understanding between them that both were weighed down by work and always in a hurry 
of his women friends foremost amongst them countess lidia ivanovna alexey alexandrovitch never thought 
all women simply as women were terrible and distasteful to him 
chapter    alexey alexandrovitch had forgotten the countess lidia ivanovna but she had not forgotten him 
at the bitterest moment of his lonely despair she came to him and without waiting to be announced walked straight into his study 
she found him as he was sitting with his head in both hands  
j ai forcé la consigne  she said walking in with rapid steps and breathing hard with excitement and rapid exercise 
 i have heard all 
alexey alexandrovitch 
dear friend  
she went on warmly squeezing his hand in both of hers and gazing with her fine pensive eyes into his 
alexey alexandrovitch frowning got up and disengaging his hand moved her a chair 
 won t you sit down countess 
i m seeing no one because i m unwell countess  he said and his lips twitched 
 dear friend  
repeated countess lidia ivanovna never taking her eyes off his and suddenly her eyebrows rose at the inner corners describing a triangle on her forehead her ugly yellow face became still uglier but alexey alexandrovitch felt that she was sorry for him and was preparing to cry 
and he too was softened he snatched her plump hand and proceeded to kiss it 
 dear friend  
she said in a voice breaking with emotion 
 you ought not to give way to grief 
your sorrow is a great one but you ought to find consolation  
 i am crushed i am annihilated i am no longer a man  
said alexey alexandrovitch letting go her hand but still gazing into her brimming eyes 
 my position is so awful because i can find nowhere i cannot find within me strength to support me  
 you will find support seek it  not in me though i beseech you to believe in my friendship  she said with a sigh 
 our support is love that love that he has vouchsafed us 
his burden is light  she said with the look of ecstasy alexey alexandrovitch knew so well 
 he will be your support and your succor  
although there was in these words a flavor of that sentimental emotion at her own lofty feelings and that new mystical fervor which had lately gained ground in petersburg and which seemed to alexey alexandrovitch disproportionate still it was pleasant to him to hear this now 
 i am weak 
i am crushed 
i foresaw nothing and now i understand nothing  
 dear friend  repeated lidia ivanovna 
 it s not the loss of what i have not now it s not that  
pursued alexey alexandrovitch 
 i do not grieve for that 
but i cannot help feeling humiliated before other people for the position i am placed in 
it is wrong but i can t help it i can t help it  
 not you it was performed that noble act of forgiveness at which i was moved to ecstasy and everyone else too but he working within your heart  said countess lidia ivanovna raising her eyes rapturously and so you cannot be ashamed of your act  
alexey alexandrovitch knitted his brows and crooking his hands he cracked his fingers 
 one must know all the facts  he said in his thin voice 
 a man s strength has its limits countess and i have reached my limits 
the whole day i have had to be making arrangements arrangements about household matters arising he emphasized the word  arising  from my new solitary position 
the servants the governess the accounts    
these pinpricks have stabbed me to the heart and i have not the strength to bear it 
at dinner   yesterday i was almost getting up from the dinner table 
i could not bear the way my son looked at me 
he did not ask me the meaning of it all but he wanted to ask and i could not bear the look in his eyes 
he was afraid to look at me but that is not all      alexey alexandrovitch would have referred to the bill that had been brought him but his voice shook and he stopped 
that bill on blue paper for a hat and ribbons he could not recall without a rush of self pity 
 i understand dear friend  said lidia ivanovna 
 i understand it all 
succor and comfort you will find not in me though i have come only to aid you if i can 
if i could take from off you all these petty humiliating cares   i understand that a woman s word a woman s superintendence is needed 
you will intrust it to me  
silently and gratefully alexey alexandrovitch pressed her hand 
 together we will take care of seryozha 
practical affairs are not my strong point 
but i will set to work 
i will be your housekeeper 
don t thank me 
i do it not from myself     i cannot help thanking you  
 but dear friend do not give way to the feeling of which you spoke  being ashamed of what is the christian s highest glory he who humbles himself shall be exalted 
and you cannot thank me 
you must thank him and pray to him for succor 
in him alone we find peace consolation salvation and love  she said and turning her eyes heavenwards she began praying as alexey alexandrovitch gathered from her silence 
alexey alexandrovitch listened to her now and those expressions which had seemed to him if not distasteful at least exaggerated now seemed to him natural and consolatory 
alexey alexandrovitch had disliked this new enthusiastic fervor 
he was a believer who was interested in religion primarily in its political aspect and the new doctrine which ventured upon several new interpretations just because it paved the way to discussion and analysis was in principle disagreeable to him 
he had hitherto taken up a cold and even antagonistic attitude to this new doctrine and with countess lidia ivanovna who had been carried away by it he had never argued but by silence had assiduously parried her attempts to provoke him into argument 
now for the first time he heard her words with pleasure and did not inwardly oppose them 
 i am very very grateful to you both for your deeds and for your words  he said when she had finished praying 
countess lidia ivanovna once more pressed both her friend s hands 
 now i will enter upon my duties  she said with a smile after a pause as she wiped away the traces of tears 
 i am going to seryozha 
only in the last extremity shall i apply to you  
and she got up and went out 
countess lidia ivanovna went into seryozha s part of the house and dropping tears on the scared child s cheeks she told him that his father was a saint and his mother was dead 
countess lidia ivanovna kept her promise 
she did actually take upon herself the care of the organization and management of alexey alexandrovitch s household 
but she had not overstated the case when saying that practical affairs were not her strong point 
all her arrangements had to be modified because they could not be carried out and they were modified by korney alexey alexandrovitch s valet who though no one was aware of the fact now managed karenin s household and quietly and discreetly reported to his master while he was dressing all it was necessary for him to know 
but lidia ivanovna s help was none the less real she gave alexey alexandrovitch moral support in the consciousness of her love and respect for him and still more as it was soothing to her to believe in that she almost turned him to christianity  that is from an indifferent and apathetic believer she turned him into an ardent and steadfast adherent of the new interpretation of christian doctrine which had been gaining ground of late in petersburg 
it was easy for alexey alexandrovitch to believe in this teaching 
alexey alexandrovitch like lidia ivanovna indeed and others who shared their views was completely devoid of vividness of imagination that spiritual faculty in virtue of which the conceptions evoked by the imagination become so vivid that they must needs be in harmony with other conceptions and with actual fact 
he saw nothing impossible and inconceivable in the idea that death though existing for unbelievers did not exist for him and that as he was possessed of the most perfect faith of the measure of which he was himself the judge therefore there was no sin in his soul and he was experiencing complete salvation here on earth 
it is true that the erroneousness and shallowness of this conception of his faith was dimly perceptible to alexey alexandrovitch and he knew that when without the slightest idea that his forgiveness was the action of a higher power he had surrendered directly to the feeling of forgiveness he had felt more happiness than now when he was thinking every instant that christ was in his heart and that in signing official papers he was doing his will 
but for alexey alexandrovitch it was a necessity to think in that way it was such a necessity for him in his humiliation to have some elevated standpoint however imaginary from which looked down upon by all he could look down on others that he clung as to his one salvation to his delusion of salvation 
chapter    the countess lidia ivanovna had as a very young and sentimental girl been married to a wealthy man of high rank an extremely good natured jovial and extremely dissipated rake 
two months after marriage her husband abandoned her and her impassioned protestations of affection he met with a sarcasm and even hostility that people knowing the count s good heart and seeing no defects in the sentimental lidia were at a loss to explain 
though they were divorced and lived apart yet whenever the husband met the wife he invariably behaved to her with the same malignant irony the cause of which was incomprehensible 
countess lidia ivanovna had long given up being in love with her husband but from that time she had never given up being in love with someone 
she was in love with several people at once both men and women she had been in love with almost everyone who had been particularly distinguished in any way 
she was in love with all the new princes and princesses who married into the imperial family she had been in love with a high dignitary of the church a vicar and a parish priest she had been in love with a journalist three slavophiles with komissarov with a minister a doctor an english missionary and karenin 
all these passions constantly waning or growing more ardent did not prevent her from keeping up the most extended and complicated relations with the court and fashionable society 
but from the time that after karenin s trouble she took him under her special protection from the time that she set to work in karenin s household looking after his welfare she felt that all her other attachments were not the real thing and that she was now genuinely in love and with no one but karenin 
the feeling she now experienced for him seemed to her stronger than any of her former feelings 
analyzing her feeling and comparing it with former passions she distinctly perceived that she would not have been in love with komissarov if he had not saved the life of the tsar that she would not have been in love with ristitch kudzhitsky if there had been no slavonic question but that she loved karenin for himself for his lofty uncomprehended soul for the sweet  to her  high notes of his voice for his drawling intonation his weary eyes his character and his soft white hands with their swollen veins 
she was not simply overjoyed at meeting him but she sought in his face signs of the impression she was making on him 
she tried to please him not by her words only but in her whole person 
for his sake it was that she now lavished more care on her dress than before 
she caught herself in reveries on what might have been if she had not been married and he had been free 
she blushed with emotion when he came into the room she could not repress a smile of rapture when he said anything amiable to her 
for several days now countess lidia ivanovna had been in a state of intense excitement 
she had learned that anna and vronsky were in petersburg 
alexey alexandrovitch must be saved from seeing her he must be saved even from the torturing knowledge that that awful woman was in the same town with him and that he might meet her any minute 
lidia ivanovna made inquiries through her friends as to what those  infamous people  as she called anna and vronsky intended doing and she endeavored so to guide every movement of her friend during those days that he could not come across them 
the young adjutant an acquaintance of vronsky through whom she obtained her information and who hoped through countess lidia ivanovna to obtain a concession told her that they had finished their business and were going away next day 
lidia ivanovna had already begun to calm down when the next morning a note was brought her the handwriting of which she recognized with horror 
it was the handwriting of anna karenina 
the envelope was of paper as thick as bark on the oblong yellow paper there was a huge monogram and the letter smelt of agreeable scent 
 who brought it  
 a commissionaire from the hotel  
it was some time before countess lidia ivanovna could sit down to read the letter 
her excitement brought on an attack of asthma to which she was subject 
when she had recovered her composure she read the following letter in french  madame la comtesse  the christian feelings with which your heart is filled give me the i feel unpardonable boldness to write to you 
i am miserable at being separated from my son 
i entreat permission to see him once before my departure 
forgive me for recalling myself to your memory 
i apply to you and not to alexey alexandrovitch simply because i do not wish to cause that generous man to suffer in remembering me 
knowing your friendship for him i know you will understand me 
could you send seryozha to me or should i come to the house at some fixed hour or will you let me know when and where i could see him away from home 
i do not anticipate a refusal knowing the magnanimity of him with whom it rests 
you cannot conceive the craving i have to see him and so cannot conceive the gratitude your help will arouse in me 
anna  everything in this letter exasperated countess lidia ivanovna its contents and the allusion to magnanimity and especially its free and easy  as she considered  tone 
 say that there is no answer  said countess lidia ivanovna and immediately opening her blotting book she wrote to alexey alexandrovitch that she hoped to see him at one o clock at the levee 
 i must talk with you of a grave and painful subject 
there we will arrange where to meet 
best of all at my house where i will order tea  as you like it 
urgent 
he lays the cross but he gives the strength to bear it  she added so as to give him some slight preparation 
countess lidia ivanovna usually wrote some two or three letters a day to alexey alexandrovitch 
she enjoyed that form of communication which gave opportunity for a refinement and air of mystery not afforded by their personal interviews 
chapter    the levee was drawing to a close 
people met as they were going away and gossiped of the latest news of the newly bestowed honors and the changes in the positions of the higher functionaries 
 if only countess marya borissovna were minister of war and princess vatkovskaya were commander in chief  said a gray headed little old man in a gold embroidered uniform addressing a tall handsome maid of honor who had questioned him about the new appointments 
 and me among the adjutants  said the maid of honor smiling 
 you have an appointment already 
you re over the ecclesiastical department 
and your assistant s karenin  
 good day prince  
said the little old man to a man who came up to him 
 what were you saying of karenin  
said the prince 
 he and putyatov have received the alexander nevsky  
 i thought he had it already  
 no 
just look at him  said the little old man pointing with his embroidered hat to karenin in a court uniform with the new red ribbon across his shoulders standing in the doorway of the hall with an influential member of the imperial council 
 pleased and happy as a brass farthing  he added stopping to shake hands with a handsome gentleman of the bedchamber of colossal proportions 
 no he s looking older  said the gentleman of the bedchamber 
 from overwork 
he s always drawing up projects nowadays 
he won t let a poor devil go nowadays till he s explained it all to him under heads  
 looking older did you say 
il fait des passions 
i believe countess lidia ivanovna s jealous now of his wife  
 oh come now please don t say any harm of countess lidia ivanovna  
 why is there any harm in her being in love with karenin  
 but is it true madame karenina s here  
 well not here in the palace but in petersburg 
i met her yesterday with alexey vronsky  bras dessous bras dessous  in the morsky  
 c est un homme qui n a pas    the gentleman of the bedchamber was beginning but he stopped to make room bowing for a member of the imperial family to pass 
thus people talked incessantly of alexey alexandrovitch finding fault with him and laughing at him while he blocking up the way of the member of the imperial council he had captured was explaining to him point by point his new financial project never interrupting his discourse for an instant for fear he should escape 
almost at the same time that his wife left alexey alexandrovitch there had come to him that bitterest moment in the life of an official  the moment when his upward career comes to a full stop 
this full stop had arrived and everyone perceived it but alexey alexandrovitch himself was not yet aware that his career was over 
whether it was due to his feud with stremov or his misfortune with his wife or simply that alexey alexandrovitch had reached his destined limits it had become evident to everyone in the course of that year that his career was at an end 
he still filled a position of consequence he sat on many commissions and committees but he was a man whose day was over and from whom nothing was expected 
whatever he said whatever he proposed was heard as though it were something long familiar and the very thing that was not needed 
but alexey alexandrovitch was not aware of this and on the contrary being cut off from direct participation in governmental activity he saw more clearly than ever the errors and defects in the action of others and thought it his duty to point out means for their correction 
shortly after his separation from his wife he began writing his first note on the new judicial procedure the first of the endless series of notes he was destined to write in the future 
alexey alexandrovitch did not merely fail to observe his hopeless position in the official world he was not merely free from anxiety on this head he was positively more satisfied than ever with his own activity 
 he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord how he may please the lord but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife  says the apostle paul and alexey alexandrovitch who was now guided in every action by scripture often recalled this text 
it seemed to him that ever since he had been left without a wife he had in these very projects of reform been serving the lord more zealously than before 
the unmistakable impatience of the member of the council trying to get away from him did not trouble alexey alexandrovitch he gave up his exposition only when the member of the council seizing his chance when one of the imperial family was passing slipped away from him 
left alone alexey alexandrovitch looked down collecting his thoughts then looked casually about him and walked towards the door where he hoped to meet countess lidia ivanovna 
 and how strong they all are how sound physically  thought alexey alexandrovitch looking at the powerfully built gentleman of the bedchamber with his well combed perfumed whiskers and at the red neck of the prince pinched by his tight uniform 
he had to pass them on his way 
 truly is it said that all the world is evil  he thought with another sidelong glance at the calves of the gentleman of the bedchamber 
moving forward deliberately alexey alexandrovitch bowed with his customary air of weariness and dignity to the gentleman who had been talking about him and looking towards the door his eyes sought countess lidia ivanovna 
 ah 
alexey alexandrovitch  
said the little old man with a malicious light in his eyes at the moment when karenin was on a level with them and was nodding with a frigid gesture i haven t congratulated you yet  said the old man pointing to his newly received ribbon 
 thank you  answered alexey alexandrovitch 
 what an  exquisite  day to day  he added laying emphasis in his peculiar way on the word  exquisite 
that they laughed at him he was well aware but he did not expect anything but hostility from them he was used to that by now 
catching sight of the yellow shoulders of lidia ivanovna jutting out above her corset and her fine pensive eyes bidding him to her alexey alexandrovitch smiled revealing untarnished white teeth and went towards her 
lidia ivanovna s dress had cost her great pains as indeed all her dresses had done of late 
her aim in dress was now quite the reverse of that she had pursued thirty years before 
then her desire had been to adorn herself with something and the more adorned the better 
now on the contrary she was perforce decked out in a way so inconsistent with her age and her figure that her one anxiety was to contrive that the contrast between these adornments and her own exterior should not be too appalling 
and as far as alexey alexandrovitch was concerned she succeeded and was in his eyes attractive 
for him she was the one island not only of goodwill to him but of love in the midst of the sea of hostility and jeering that surrounded him 
passing through rows of ironical eyes he was drawn as naturally to her loving glance as a plant to the sun 
 i congratulate you  she said to him her eyes on his ribbon 
suppressing a smile of pleasure he shrugged his shoulders closing his eyes as though to say that that could not be a source of joy to him 
countess lidia ivanovna was very well aware that it was one of his chief sources of satisfaction though he never admitted it 
 how is our angel  
said countess lidia ivanovna meaning seryozha 
 i can t say i was quite pleased with him  said alexey alexandrovitch raising his eyebrows and opening his eyes 
 and sitnikov is not satisfied with him  
 sitnikov was the tutor to whom seryozha s secular education had been intrusted  
 as i have mentioned to you there s a sort of coldness in him towards the most important questions which ought to touch the heart of every man and every child      alexey alexandrovitch began expounding his views on the sole question that interested him besides the service  the education of his son 
when alexey alexandrovitch with lidia ivanovna s help had been brought back anew to life and activity he felt it his duty to undertake the education of the son left on his hands 
having never before taken any interest in educational questions alexey alexandrovitch devoted some time to the theoretical study of the subject 
after reading several books on anthropology education and didactics alexey alexandrovitch drew up a plan of education and engaging the best tutor in petersburg to superintend it he set to work and the subject continually absorbed him 
 yes but the heart 
i see in him his father s heart and with such a heart a child cannot go far wrong  said lidia ivanovna with enthusiasm 
 yes perhaps     as for me i do my duty 
it s all i can do  
 you re coming to me  said countess lidia ivanovna after a pause we have to speak of a subject painful for you 
i would give anything to have spared you certain memories but others are not of the same mind 
i have received a letter from  her 
she  is here in petersburg  
alexey alexandrovitch shuddered at the allusion to his wife but immediately his face assumed the deathlike rigidity which expressed utter helplessness in the matter 
 i was expecting it  he said 
countess lidia ivanovna looked at him ecstatically and tears of rapture at the greatness of his soul came into her eyes 
chapter    when alexey alexandrovitch came into the countess lidia ivanovna s snug little boudoir decorated with old china and hung with portraits the lady herself had not yet made her appearance 
she was changing her dress 
a cloth was laid on a round table and on it stood a china tea service and a silver spirit lamp and tea kettle 
alexey alexandrovitch looked idly about at the endless familiar portraits which adorned the room and sitting down to the table he opened a new testament lying upon it 
the rustle of the countess s silk skirt drew his attention off 
 well now we can sit quietly  said countess lidia ivanovna slipping hurriedly with an agitated smile between the table and the sofa and talk over our tea  
after some words of preparation countess lidia ivanovna breathing hard and flushing crimson gave into alexey alexandrovitch s hands the letter she had received 
after reading the letter he sat a long while in silence 
 i don t think i have the right to refuse her  he said timidly lifting his eyes 
 dear friend you never see evil in anyone  
 on the contrary i see that all is evil 
but whether it is just     his face showed irresolution and a seeking for counsel support and guidance in a matter he did not understand 
 no  countess lidia ivanovna interrupted him there are limits to everything 
i can understand immorality  she said not quite truthfully since she never could understand that which leads women to immorality but i don t understand cruelty to whom 
to you 
how can she stay in the town where you are 
no the longer one lives the more one learns 
and i m learning to understand your loftiness and her baseness  
 who is to throw a stone  
said alexey alexandrovitch unmistakably pleased with the part he had to play 
 i have forgiven all and so i cannot deprive her of what is exacted by love in her  by her love for her son      but is that love my friend 
is it sincere 
admitting that you have forgiven  that you forgive  have we the right to work on the feelings of that angel 
he looks on her as dead 
he prays for her and beseeches god to have mercy on her sins 
and it is better so 
but now what will he think  
 i had not thought of that  said alexey alexandrovitch evidently agreeing 
countess lidia ivanovna hid her face in her hands and was silent 
she was praying 
 if you ask my advice  she said having finished her prayer and uncovered her face i do not advise you to do this 
do you suppose i don t see how you are suffering how this has torn open your wounds 
but supposing that as always you don t think of yourself what can it lead to   to fresh suffering for you to torture for the child 
if there were a trace of humanity left in her she ought not to wish for it herself 
no i have no hesitation in saying i advise not and if you will intrust it to me i will write to her  
and alexey alexandrovitch consented and countess lidia ivanovna sent the following letter in french  dear madame  to be reminded of you might have results for your son in leading to questions on his part which could not be answered without implanting in the child s soul a spirit of censure towards what should be for him sacred and therefore i beg you to interpret your husband s refusal in the spirit of christian love 
i pray to almighty god to have mercy on you 
countess lidia  this letter attained the secret object which countess lidia ivanovna had concealed from herself 
it wounded anna to the quick 
for his part alexey alexandrovitch on returning home from lidia ivanovna s could not all that day concentrate himself on his usual pursuits and find that spiritual peace of one saved and believing which he had felt of late 
the thought of his wife who had so greatly sinned against him and towards whom he had been so saintly as countess lidia ivanovna had so justly told him ought not to have troubled him but he was not easy he could not understand the book he was reading he could not drive away harassing recollections of his relations with her of the mistake which as it now seemed he had made in regard to her 
the memory of how he had received her confession of infidelity on their way home from the races especially that he had insisted only on the observance of external decorum and had not sent a challenge tortured him like a remorse 
he was tortured too by the thought of the letter he had written her and most of all his forgiveness which nobody wanted and his care of the other man s child made his heart burn with shame and remorse 
and just the same feeling of shame and regret he felt now as he reviewed all his past with her recalling the awkward words in which after long wavering he had made her an offer 
 but how have i been to blame  
he said to himself 
and this question always excited another question in him  whether they felt differently did their loving and marrying differently these vronskys and oblonskys   these gentlemen of the bedchamber with their fine calves 
and there passed before his mind a whole series of these mettlesome vigorous self confident men who always and everywhere drew his inquisitive attention in spite of himself 
he tried to dispel these thoughts he tried to persuade himself that he was not living for this transient life but for the life of eternity and that there was peace and love in his heart 
but the fact that he had in this transient trivial life made as it seemed to him a few trivial mistakes tortured him as though the eternal salvation in which he believed had no existence 
but this temptation did not last long and soon there was reestablished once more in alexey alexandrovitch s soul the peace and the elevation by virtue of which he could forget what he did not want to remember 
chapter    well kapitonitch  
said seryozha coming back rosy and good humored from his walk the day before his birthday and giving his overcoat to the tall old hall porter who smiled down at the little person from the height of his long figure 
 well has the bandaged clerk been here today 
did papa see him  
 he saw him 
the minute the chief secretary came out i announced him  said the hall porter with a good humored wink 
 here i ll take it off  
 seryozha  
said the tutor stopping in the doorway leading to the inner rooms 
 take it off yourself  
but seryozha though he heard his tutor s feeble voice did not pay attention to it 
he stood keeping hold of the hall porter s belt and gazing into his face 
 well and did papa do what he wanted for him  
the hall porter nodded his head affirmatively 
the clerk with his face tied up who had already been seven times to ask some favor of alexey alexandrovitch interested both seryozha and the hall porter 
seryozha had come upon him in the hall and had heard him plaintively beg the hall porter to announce him saying that he and his children had death staring them in the face 
since then seryozha having met him a second time in the hall took great interest in him 
 well was he very glad  
he asked 
 glad 
i should think so 
almost dancing as he walked away  
 and has anything been left  
asked seryozha after a pause 
 come sir  said the hall porter then with a shake of his head he whispered something from the countess  
seryozha understood at once that what the hall porter was speaking of was a present from countess lidia ivanovna for his birthday 
 what do you say 
where  
 korney took it to your papa 
a fine plaything it must be too  
 how big 
like this  
 rather small but a fine thing  
 a book  
 no a thing 
run along run along vassily lukitch is calling you  said the porter hearing the tutor s steps approaching and carefully taking away from his belt the little hand in the glove half pulled off he signed with his head towards the tutor 
 vassily lukitch in a tiny minute  
answered seryozha with that gay and loving smile which always won over the conscientious vassily lukitch 
seryozha was too happy everything was too delightful for him to be able to help sharing with his friend the porter the family good fortune of which he had heard during his walk in the public gardens from lidia ivanovna s niece 
this piece of good news seemed to him particularly important from its coming at the same time with the gladness of the bandaged clerk and his own gladness at toys having come for him 
it seemed to seryozha that this was a day on which everyone ought to be glad and happy 
 you know papa s received the alexander nevsky today  
 to be sure i do 
people have been already to congratulate him  
 and is he glad  
 glad at the tsar s gracious favor 
i should think so 
it s a proof he s deserved it  said the porter severely and seriously 
seryozha fell to dreaming gazing up at the face of the porter which he had thoroughly studied in every detail especially the chin that hung down between the gray whiskers never seen by anyone but seryozha who saw him only from below 
 well and has your daughter been to see you lately  
the porter s daughter was a ballet dancer 
 when is she to come on week days 
they ve their lessons to learn too 
and you ve your lesson sir run along  
on coming into the room seryozha instead of sitting down to his lessons told his tutor of his supposition that what had been brought him must be a machine 
 what do you think  
he inquired 
but vassily lukitch was thinking of nothing but the necessity of learning the grammar lesson for the teacher who was coming at two 
 no do just tell me vassily lukitch  he asked suddenly when he was seated at their work table with the book in his hands what is greater than the alexander nevsky 
you know papa s received the alexander nevsky  
vassily lukitch replied that the vladimir was greater than the alexander nevsky 
 and higher still  
 well highest of all is the andrey pervozvanny  
 and higher than the andrey  
 i don t know  
 what you don t know  
and seryozha leaning on his elbows sank into deep meditation 
his meditations were of the most complex and diverse character 
he imagined his father s having suddenly been presented with both the vladimir and the andrey today and in consequence being much better tempered at his lesson and dreamed how when he was grown up he would himself receive all the orders and what they might invent higher than the andrey 
directly any higher order were invented he would win it 
they would make a higher one still and he would immediately win that too 
the time passed in such meditations and when the teacher came the lesson about the adverbs of place and time and manner of action was not ready and the teacher was not only displeased but hurt 
this touched seryozha 
he felt he was not to blame for not having learned the lesson however much he tried he was utterly unable to do that 
as long as the teacher was explaining to him he believed him and seemed to comprehend but as soon as he was left alone he was positively unable to recollect and to understand that the short and familiar word suddenly is an adverb of manner of action 
still he was sorry that he had disappointed the teacher 
he chose a moment when the teacher was looking in silence at the book 
 mihail ivanitch when is your birthday  
he asked all of a sudden 
 you d much better be thinking about your work 
birthdays are of no importance to a rational being 
it s a day like any other on which one has to do one s work  
seryozha looked intently at the teacher at his scanty beard at his spectacles which had slipped down below the ridge on his nose and fell into so deep a reverie that he heard nothing of what the teacher was explaining to him 
he knew that the teacher did not think what he said he felt it from the tone in which it was said 
 but why have they all agreed to speak just in the same manner always the dreariest and most useless stuff 
why does he keep me off why doesn t he love me  
he asked himself mournfully and could not think of an answer 
chapter    after the lesson with the grammar teacher came his father s lesson 
while waiting for his father seryozha sat at the table playing with a penknife and fell to dreaming 
among seryozha s favorite occupations was searching for his mother during his walks 
he did not believe in death generally and in her death in particular in spite of what lidia ivanovna had told him and his father had confirmed and it was just because of that and after he had been told she was dead that he had begun looking for her when out for a walk 
every woman of full graceful figure with dark hair was his mother 
at the sight of such a woman such a feeling of tenderness was stirred within him that his breath failed him and tears came into his eyes 
and he was on the tiptoe of expectation that she would come up to him would lift her veil 
all her face would be visible she would smile she would hug him he would sniff her fragrance feel the softness of her arms and cry with happiness just as he had one evening lain on her lap while she tickled him and he laughed and bit her white ring covered fingers 
later when he accidentally learned from his old nurse that his mother was not dead and his father and lidia ivanovna had explained to him that she was dead to him because she was wicked which he could not possibly believe because he loved her  he went on seeking her and expecting her in the same way 
that day in the public gardens there had been a lady in a lilac veil whom he had watched with a throbbing heart believing it to be she as she came towards them along the path 
the lady had not come up to them but had disappeared somewhere 
that day more intensely than ever seryozha felt a rush of love for her and now waiting for his father he forgot everything and cut all round the edge of the table with his penknife staring straight before him with sparkling eyes and dreaming of her 
 here is your papa  
said vassily lukitch rousing him 
seryozha jumped up and went up to his father and kissing his hand looked at him intently trying to discover signs of his joy at receiving the alexander nevsky 
 did you have a nice walk  
said alexey alexandrovitch sitting down in his easy chair pulling the volume of the old testament to him and opening it 
although alexey alexandrovitch had more than once told seryozha that every christian ought to know scripture history thoroughly he often referred to the bible himself during the lesson and seryozha observed this 
 yes it was very nice indeed papa  said seryozha sitting sideways on his chair and rocking it which was forbidden 
 i saw nadinka nadinka was a niece of lidia ivanovna s who was being brought up in her house  
 she told me you d been given a new star 
are you glad papa  
 first of all don t rock your chair please  said alexey alexandrovitch 
 and secondly it s not the reward that s precious but the work itself 
and i could have wished you understood that 
if you now are going to work to study in order to win a reward then the work will seem hard to you but when you work alexey alexandrovitch as he spoke thought of how he had been sustained by a sense of duty through the wearisome labor of the morning consisting of signing one hundred and eighty papers  loving your work you will find your reward in it  
seryozha s eyes that had been shining with gaiety and tenderness grew dull and dropped before his father s gaze 
this was the same long familiar tone his father always took with him and seryozha had learned by now to fall in with it 
his father always talked to him  so seryozha felt  as though he were addressing some boy of his own imagination one of those boys that exist in books utterly unlike himself 
and seryozha always tried with his father to act being the story book boy 
 you understand that i hope  
said his father 
 yes papa  answered seryozha acting the part of the imaginary boy 
the lesson consisted of learning by heart several verses out of the gospel and the repetition of the beginning of the old testament 
the verses from the gospel seryozha knew fairly well but at the moment when he was saying them he became so absorbed in watching the sharply protruding bony knobbiness of his father s forehead that he lost the thread and he transposed the end of one verse and the beginning of another 
so it was evident to alexey alexandrovitch that he did not understand what he was saying and that irritated him 
he frowned and began explaining what seryozha had heard many times before and never could remember because he understood it too well just as that suddenly is an adverb of manner of action 
seryozha looked with scared eyes at his father and could think of nothing but whether his father would make him repeat what he had said as he sometimes did 
and this thought so alarmed seryozha that he now understood nothing 
but his father did not make him repeat it and passed on to the lesson out of the old testament 
seryozha recounted the events themselves well enough but when he had to answer questions as to what certain events prefigured he knew nothing though he had already been punished over this lesson 
the passage at which he was utterly unable to say anything and began fidgeting and cutting the table and swinging his chair was where he had to repeat the patriarchs before the flood 
he did not know one of them except enoch who had been taken up alive to heaven 
last time he had remembered their names but now he had forgotten them utterly chiefly because enoch was the personage he liked best in the whole of the old testament and enoch s translation to heaven was connected in his mind with a whole long train of thought in which he became absorbed now while he gazed with fascinated eyes at his father s watch chain and a half unbuttoned button on his waistcoat 
in death of which they talked to him so often seryozha disbelieved entirely 
he did not believe that those he loved could die above all that he himself would die 
that was to him something utterly inconceivable and impossible 
but he had been told that all men die he had asked people indeed whom he trusted and they too had confirmed it his old nurse too said the same though reluctantly 
but enoch had not died and so it followed that everyone did not die 
 and why cannot anyone else so serve god and be taken alive to heaven  
thought seryozha 
bad people that is those seryozha did not like they might die but the good might all be like enoch 
 well what are the names of the patriarchs  
 enoch enos    but you have said that already 
this is bad seryozha very bad 
if you don t try to learn what is more necessary than anything for a christian  said his father getting up whatever can interest you 
i am displeased with you and piotr ignatitch this was the most important of his teachers is displeased with you    
i shall have to punish you  
his father and his teacher were both displeased with seryozha and he certainly did learn his lessons very badly 
but still it could not be said he was a stupid boy 
on the contrary he was far cleverer than the boys his teacher held up as examples to seryozha 
in his father s opinion he did not want to learn what he was taught 
in reality he could not learn that 
he could not because the claims of his own soul were more binding on him than those claims his father and his teacher made upon him 
those claims were in opposition and he was in direct conflict with his education 
he was nine years old he was a child but he knew his own soul it was precious to him he guarded it as the eyelid guards the eye and without the key of love he let no one into his soul 
his teachers complained that he would not learn while his soul was brimming over with thirst for knowledge 
and he learned from kapitonitch from his nurse from nadinka from vassily lukitch but not from his teachers 
the spring his father and his teachers reckoned upon to turn their mill wheels had long dried up at the source but its waters did their work in another channel 
his father punished seryozha by not letting him go to see nadinka lidia ivanovna s niece but this punishment turned out happily for seryozha 
vassily lukitch was in a good humor and showed him how to make windmills 
the whole evening passed over this work and in dreaming how to make a windmill on which he could turn himself  clutching at the sails or tying himself on and whirling round 
of his mother seryozha did not think all the evening but when he had gone to bed he suddenly remembered her and prayed in his own words that his mother tomorrow for his birthday might leave off hiding herself and come to him 
 vassily lukitch do you know what i prayed for tonight extra besides the regular things  
 that you might learn your lessons better  
 no  
 toys  
 no 
you ll never guess 
a splendid thing but it s a secret 
when it comes to pass i ll tell you 
can t you guess  
 no i can t guess 
you tell me  said vassily lukitch with a smile which was rare with him 
 come lie down i m putting out the candle  
 without the candle i can see better what i see and what i prayed for 
there 
i was almost telling the secret  
said seryozha laughing gaily 
when the candle was taken away seryozha heard and felt his mother 
she stood over him and with loving eyes caressed him 
but then came windmills a knife everything began to be mixed up and he fell asleep 
chapter    on arriving in petersburg vronsky and anna stayed at one of the best hotels vronsky apart in a lower story anna above with her child its nurse and her maid in a large suite of four rooms 
on the day of his arrival vronsky went to his brother s 
there he found his mother who had come from moscow on business 
his mother and sister in law greeted him as usual they asked him about his stay abroad and talked of their common acquaintances but did not let drop a single word in allusion to his connection with anna 
his brother came the next morning to see vronsky and of his own accord asked him about her and alexey vronsky told him directly that he looked upon his connection with madame karenina as marriage that he hoped to arrange a divorce and then to marry her and until then he considered her as much a wife as any other wife and he begged him to tell their mother and his wife so 
 if the world disapproves i don t care  said vronsky but if my relations want to be on terms of relationship with me they will have to be on the same terms with my wife  
the elder brother who had always a respect for his younger brother s judgment could not well tell whether he was right or not till the world had decided the question for his part he had nothing against it and with alexey he went up to see anna 
before his brother as before everyone vronsky addressed anna with a certain formality treating her as he might a very intimate friend but it was understood that his brother knew their real relations and they talked about anna s going to vronsky s estate 
in spite of all his social experience vronsky was in consequence of the new position in which he was placed laboring under a strange misapprehension 
one would have thought he must have understood that society was closed for him and anna but now some vague ideas had sprung up in his brain that this was only the case in old fashioned days and that now with the rapidity of modern progress he had unconsciously become by now a partisan of every sort of progress the views of society had changed and that the question whether they would be received in society was not a foregone conclusion 
 of course  he thought she would not be received at court but intimate friends can and must look at it in the proper light  
one may sit for several hours at a stretch with one s legs crossed in the same position if one knows that there s nothing to prevent one s changing one s position but if a man knows that he must remain sitting so with crossed legs then cramps come on the legs begin to twitch and to strain towards the spot to which one would like to draw them 
this was what vronsky was experiencing in regard to the world 
though at the bottom of his heart he knew that the world was shut on them he put it to the test whether the world had not changed by now and would not receive them 
but he very quickly perceived that though the world was open for him personally it was closed for anna 
just as in the game of cat and mouse the hands raised for him were dropped to bar the way for anna 
one of the first ladies of petersburg society whom vronsky saw was his cousin betsy 
 at last  
she greeted him joyfully 
 and anna 
how glad i am 
where are you stopping 
i can fancy after your delightful travels you must find our poor petersburg horrid 
i can fancy your honeymoon in rome 
how about the divorce 
is that all over  
vronsky noticed that betsy s enthusiasm waned when she learned that no divorce had as yet taken place 
 people will throw stones at me i know  she said but i shall come and see anna yes i shall certainly come 
you won t be here long i suppose  
and she did certainly come to see anna the same day but her tone was not at all the same as in former days 
she unmistakably prided herself on her courage and wished anna to appreciate the fidelity of her friendship 
she only stayed ten minutes talking of society gossip and on leaving she said  you ve never told me when the divorce is to be 
supposing i m ready to fling my cap over the mill other starchy people will give you the cold shoulder until you re married 
and that s so simple nowadays 
ça se fait 
so you re going on friday 
sorry we shan t see each other again  
from betsy s tone vronsky might have grasped what he had to expect from the world but he made another effort in his own family 
his mother he did not reckon upon 
he knew that his mother who had been so enthusiastic over anna at their first acquaintance would have no mercy on her now for having ruined her son s career 
but he had more hope of varya his brother s wife 
he fancied she would not throw stones and would go simply and directly to see anna and would receive her in her own house 
the day after his arrival vronsky went to her and finding her alone expressed his wishes directly 
 you know alexey  she said after hearing him how fond i am of you and how ready i am to do anything for you but i have not spoken because i knew i could be of no use to you and to anna arkadyevna  she said articulating the name anna arkadyevna with particular care 
 don t suppose please that i judge her 
never perhaps in her place i should have done the same 
i don t and can t enter into that  she said glancing timidly at his gloomy face 
 but one must call things by their names 
you want me to go and see her to ask her here and to rehabilitate her in society but do understand that i  cannot  do so 
i have daughters growing up and i must live in the world for my husband s sake 
well i m ready to come and see anna arkadyevna she will understand that i can t ask her here or i should have to do so in such a way that she would not meet people who look at things differently that would offend her 
i can t raise her     oh i don t regard her as fallen more than hundreds of women you do receive  
vronsky interrupted her still more gloomily and he got up in silence understanding that his sister in law s decision was not to be shaken 
 alexey 
don t be angry with me 
please understand that i m not to blame  began varya looking at him with a timid smile 
 i m not angry with you  he said still as gloomily but i m sorry in two ways 
i m sorry too that this means breaking up our friendship  if not breaking up at least weakening it 
you will understand that for me too it cannot be otherwise  
and with that he left her 
vronsky knew that further efforts were useless and that he had to spend these few days in petersburg as though in a strange town avoiding every sort of relation with his own old circle in order not to be exposed to the annoyances and humiliations which were so intolerable to him 
one of the most unpleasant features of his position in petersburg was that alexey alexandrovitch and his name seemed to meet him everywhere 
he could not begin to talk of anything without the conversation turning on alexey alexandrovitch he could not go anywhere without risk of meeting him 
so at least it seemed to vronsky just as it seems to a man with a sore finger that he is continually as though on purpose grazing his sore finger on everything 
their stay in petersburg was the more painful to vronsky that he perceived all the time a sort of new mood that he could not understand in anna 
at one time she would seem in love with him and then she would become cold irritable and impenetrable 
she was worrying over something and keeping something back from him and did not seem to notice the humiliations which poisoned his existence and for her with her delicate intuition must have been still more unbearable 
chapter    one of anna s objects in coming back to russia had been to see her son 
from the day she left italy the thought of it had never ceased to agitate her 
and as she got nearer to petersburg the delight and importance of this meeting grew ever greater in her imagination 
she did not even put to herself the question how to arrange it 
it seemed to her natural and simple to see her son when she should be in the same town with him 
but on her arrival in petersburg she was suddenly made distinctly aware of her present position in society and she grasped the fact that to arrange this meeting was no easy matter 
she had now been two days in petersburg 
the thought of her son never left her for a single instant but she had not yet seen him 
to go straight to the house where she might meet alexey alexandrovitch that she felt she had no right to do 
she might be refused admittance and insulted 
to write and so enter into relations with her husband  that it made her miserable to think of doing she could only be at peace when she did not think of her husband 
to get a glimpse of her son out walking finding out where and when he went out was not enough for her she had so looked forward to this meeting she had so much she must say to him she so longed to embrace him to kiss him 
seryozha s old nurse might be a help to her and show her what to do 
but the nurse was not now living in alexey alexandrovitch s house 
in this uncertainty and in efforts to find the nurse two days had slipped by 
hearing of the close intimacy between alexey alexandrovitch and countess lidia ivanovna anna decided on the third day to write to her a letter which cost her great pains and in which she intentionally said that permission to see her son must depend on her husband s generosity 
she knew that if the letter were shown to her husband he would keep up his character of magnanimity and would not refuse her request 
the commissionaire who took the letter had brought her back the most cruel and unexpected answer that there was no answer 
she had never felt so humiliated as at the moment when sending for the commissionaire she heard from him the exact account of how he had waited and how afterwards he had been told there was no answer 
anna felt humiliated insulted but she saw that from her point of view countess lidia ivanovna was right 
her suffering was the more poignant that she had to bear it in solitude 
she could not and would not share it with vronsky 
she knew that to him although he was the primary cause of her distress the question of her seeing her son would seem a matter of very little consequence 
she knew that he would never be capable of understanding all the depth of her suffering that for his cool tone at any allusion to it she would begin to hate him 
and she dreaded that more than anything in the world and so she hid from him everything that related to her son 
spending the whole day at home she considered ways of seeing her son and had reached a decision to write to her husband 
she was just composing this letter when she was handed the letter from lidia ivanovna 
the countess s silence had subdued and depressed her but the letter all that she read between the lines in it so exasperated her this malice was so revolting beside her passionate legitimate tenderness for her son that she turned against other people and left off blaming herself 
 this coldness  this pretense of feeling  
she said to herself 
 they must needs insult me and torture the child and i am to submit to it 
not on any consideration 
she is worse than i am 
i don t lie anyway  
and she decided on the spot that next day seryozha s birthday she would go straight to her husband s house bribe or deceive the servants but at any cost see her son and overturn the hideous deception with which they were encompassing the unhappy child 
she went to a toy shop bought toys and thought over a plan of action 
she would go early in the morning at eight o clock when alexey alexandrovitch would be certain not to be up 
she would have money in her hand to give the hall porter and the footman so that they should let her in and not raising her veil she would say that she had come from seryozha s godfather to congratulate him and that she had been charged to leave the toys at his bedside 
she had prepared everything but the words she should say to her son 
often as she had dreamed of it she could never think of anything 
the next day at eight o clock in the morning anna got out of a hired sledge and rang at the front entrance of her former home 
 run and see what s wanted 
some lady  said kapitonitch who not yet dressed in his overcoat and galoshes had peeped out of the window and seen a lady in a veil standing close up to the door 
his assistant a lad anna did not know had no sooner opened the door to her than she came in and pulling a three rouble note out of her muff put it hurriedly into his hand 
 seryozha  sergey alexeitch  she said and was going on 
scrutinizing the note the porter s assistant stopped her at the second glass door 
 whom do you want  
he asked 
she did not hear his words and made no answer 
noticing the embarrassment of the unknown lady kapitonitch went out to her opened the second door for her and asked her what she was pleased to want 
 from prince skorodumov for sergey alexeitch  she said 
 his honor s not up yet  said the porter looking at her attentively 
anna had not anticipated that the absolutely unchanged hall of the house where she had lived for nine years would so greatly affect her 
memories sweet and painful rose one after another in her heart and for a moment she forgot what she was here for 
 would you kindly wait  
said kapitonitch taking off her fur cloak 
as he took off the cloak kapitonitch glanced at her face recognized her and made her a low bow in silence 
 please walk in your excellency  he said to her 
she tried to say something but her voice refused to utter any sound with a guilty and imploring glance at the old man she went with light swift steps up the stairs 
bent double and his galoshes catching in the steps kapitonitch ran after her trying to overtake her 
 the tutor s there maybe he s not dressed 
i ll let him know  
anna still mounted the familiar staircase not understanding what the old man was saying 
 this way to the left if you please 
excuse its not being tidy 
his honor s in the old parlor now  the hall porter said panting 
 excuse me wait a little your excellency i ll just see  he said and overtaking her he opened the high door and disappeared behind it 
anna stood still waiting 
 he s only just awake  said the hall porter coming out 
and at the very instant the porter said this anna caught the sound of a childish yawn 
from the sound of this yawn alone she knew her son and seemed to see him living before her eyes 
 let me in go away  
she said and went in through the high doorway 
on the right of the door stood a bed and sitting up in the bed was the boy 
his little body bent forward with his nightshirt unbuttoned he was stretching and still yawning 
the instant his lips came together they curved into a blissfully sleepy smile and with that smile he slowly and deliciously rolled back again 
 seryozha  
she whispered going noiselessly up to him 
when she was parted from him and all this latter time when she had been feeling a fresh rush of love for him she had pictured him as he was at four years old when she had loved him most of all 
now he was not even the same as when she had left him he was still further from the four year old baby more grown and thinner 
how thin his face was how short his hair was 
what long hands 
how he had changed since she left him 
but it was he with his head his lips his soft neck and broad little shoulders 
 seryozha  
she repeated just in the child s ear 
he raised himself again on his elbow turned his tangled head from side to side as though looking for something and opened his eyes 
slowly and inquiringly he looked for several seconds at his mother standing motionless before him then all at once he smiled a blissful smile and shutting his eyes rolled not backwards but towards her into her arms 
 seryozha 
my darling boy  
she said breathing hard and putting her arms round his plump little body 
 mother  
he said wriggling about in her arms so as to touch her hands with different parts of him 
smiling sleepily still with closed eyes he flung fat little arms round her shoulders rolled towards her with the delicious sleepy warmth and fragrance that is only found in children and began rubbing his face against her neck and shoulders 
 i know  he said opening his eyes it s my birthday today 
i knew you d come 
i ll get up directly  
and saying that he dropped asleep 
anna looked at him hungrily she saw how he had grown and changed in her absence 
she knew and did not know the bare legs so long now that were thrust out below the quilt those short cropped curls on his neck in which she had so often kissed him 
she touched all this and could say nothing tears choked her 
 what are you crying for mother  
he said waking completely up 
 mother what are you crying for  
he cried in a tearful voice 
 i won t cry   i m crying for joy 
it s so long since i ve seen you 
i won t i won t  she said gulping down her tears and turning away 
 come it s time for you to dress now  she added after a pause and never letting go his hands she sat down by his bedside on the chair where his clothes were put ready for him 
 how do you dress without me 
how    she tried to begin talking simply and cheerfully but she could not and again she turned away 
 i don t have a cold bath papa didn t order it 
and you ve not seen vassily lukitch 
he ll come in soon 
why you re sitting on my clothes  
and seryozha went off into a peal of laughter 
she looked at him and smiled 
 mother darling sweet one  
he shouted flinging himself on her again and hugging her 
it was as though only now on seeing her smile he fully grasped what had happened 
 i don t want that on  he said taking off her hat 
and as it were seeing her afresh without her hat he fell to kissing her again 
 but what did you think about me 
you didn t think i was dead  
 i never believed it  
 you didn t believe it my sweet  
 i knew i knew  
he repeated his favorite phrase and snatching the hand that was stroking his hair he pressed the open palm to his mouth and kissed it 
chapter    meanwhile vassily lukitch had not at first understood who this lady was and had learned from their conversation that it was no other person than the mother who had left her husband and whom he had not seen as he had entered the house after her departure 
he was in doubt whether to go in or not or whether to communicate with alexey alexandrovitch 
reflecting finally that his duty was to get seryozha up at the hour fixed and that it was therefore not his business to consider who was there the mother or anyone else but simply to do his duty he finished dressing went to the door and opened it 
but the embraces of the mother and child the sound of their voices and what they were saying made him change his mind 
he shook his head and with a sigh he closed the door 
 i ll wait another ten minutes  he said to himself clearing his throat and wiping away tears 
among the servants of the household there was intense excitement all this time 
all had heard that their mistress had come and that kapitonitch had let her in and that she was even now in the nursery and that their master always went in person to the nursery at nine o clock and every one fully comprehended that it was impossible for the husband and wife to meet and that they must prevent it 
korney the valet going down to the hall porter s room asked who had let her in and how it was he had done so and ascertaining that kapitonitch had admitted her and shown her up he gave the old man a talking to 
the hall porter was doggedly silent but when korney told him he ought to be sent away kapitonitch darted up to him and waving his hands in korney s face began  oh yes to be sure you d not have let her in 
after ten years service and never a word but of kindness and there you d up and say be off go along get away with you  
oh yes you re a shrewd one at politics i dare say 
you don t need to be taught how to swindle the master and to filch fur coats  
 soldier  
said korney contemptuously and he turned to the nurse who was coming in 
 here what do you think marya efimovna he let her in without a word to anyone  korney said addressing her 
 alexey alexandrovitch will be down immediately  and go into the nursery  
 a pretty business a pretty business  
said the nurse 
 you korney vassilievitch you d best keep him some way or other the master while i ll run and get her away somehow 
a pretty business  
when the nurse went into the nursery seryozha was telling his mother how he and nadinka had had a fall in sledging downhill and had turned over three times 
she was listening to the sound of his voice watching his face and the play of expression on it touching his hand but she did not follow what he was saying 
she must go she must leave him   this was the only thing she was thinking and feeling 
she heard the steps of vassily lukitch coming up to the door and coughing she heard too the steps of the nurse as she came near but she sat like one turned to stone incapable of beginning to speak or to get up 
 mistress darling  
began the nurse going up to anna and kissing her hands and shoulders 
 god has brought joy indeed to our boy on his birthday 
you aren t changed one bit  
 oh nurse dear i didn t know you were in the house  said anna rousing herself for a moment 
 i m not living here i m living with my daughter 
i came for the birthday anna arkadyevna darling  
the nurse suddenly burst into tears and began kissing her hand again 
seryozha with radiant eyes and smiles holding his mother by one hand and his nurse by the other pattered on the rug with his fat little bare feet 
the tenderness shown by his beloved nurse to his mother threw him into an ecstasy 
 mother 
she often comes to see me and when she comes    he was beginning but he stopped noticing that the nurse was saying something in a whisper to his mother and that in his mother s face there was a look of dread and something like shame which was so strangely unbecoming to her 
she went up to him 
 my sweet  
she said 
she could not say  good bye  but the expression on her face said it and he understood 
 darling darling kootik  
she used the name by which she had called him when he was little you won t forget me 
you    but she could not say more 
how often afterwards she thought of words she might have said 
but now she did not know how to say it and could say nothing 
but seryozha knew all she wanted to say to him 
he understood that she was unhappy and loved him 
he understood even what the nurse had whispered 
he had caught the words always at nine o clock  and he knew that this was said of his father and that his father and mother could not meet 
that he understood but one thing he could not understand  why there should be a look of dread and shame in her face    
she was not in fault but she was afraid of him and ashamed of something 
he would have liked to put a question that would have set at rest this doubt but he did not dare he saw that she was miserable and he felt for her 
silently he pressed close to her and whispered don t go yet 
he won t come just yet  
the mother held him away from her to see what he was thinking what to say to him and in his frightened face she read not only that he was speaking of his father but as it were asking her what he ought to think about his father 
 seryozha my darling  she said love him he s better and kinder than i am and i have done him wrong 
when you grow up you will judge  
 there s no one better than you     
he cried in despair through his tears and clutching her by the shoulders he began squeezing her with all his force to him his arms trembling with the strain 
 my sweet my little one  
said anna and she cried as weakly and childishly as he 
at that moment the door opened 
vassily lukitch came in 
at the other door there was the sound of steps and the nurse in a scared whisper said he s coming  and gave anna her hat 
seryozha sank onto the bed and sobbed hiding his face in his hands 
anna removed his hands once more kissed his wet face and with rapid steps went to the door 
alexey alexandrovitch walked in meeting her 
seeing her he stopped short and bowed his head 
although she had just said he was better and kinder than she in the rapid glance she flung at him taking in his whole figure in all its details feelings of repulsion and hatred for him and jealousy over her son took possession of her 
with a swift gesture she put down her veil and quickening her pace almost ran out of the room 
she had not time to undo and so carried back with her the parcel of toys she had chosen the day before in a toy shop with such love and sorrow 
chapter    as intensely as anna had longed to see her son and long as she had been thinking of it and preparing herself for it she had not in the least expected that seeing him would affect her so deeply 
on getting back to her lonely rooms in the hotel she could not for a long while understand why she was there 
 yes it s all over and i am again alone  she said to herself and without taking off her hat she sat down in a low chair by the hearth 
fixing her eyes on a bronze clock standing on a table between the windows she tried to think 
the french maid brought from abroad came in to suggest she should dress 
she gazed at her wonderingly and said presently  
a footman offered her coffee 
 later on  she said 
the italian nurse after having taken the baby out in her best came in with her and brought her to anna 
the plump well fed little baby on seeing her mother as she always did held out her fat little hands and with a smile on her toothless mouth began like a fish with a float bobbing her fingers up and down the starched folds of her embroidered skirt making them rustle 
it was impossible not to smile not to kiss the baby impossible not to hold out a finger for her to clutch crowing and prancing all over impossible not to offer her a lip which she sucked into her little mouth by way of a kiss 
and all this anna did and took her in her arms and made her dance and kissed her fresh little cheek and bare little elbows but at the sight of this child it was plainer than ever to her that the feeling she had for her could not be called love in comparison with what she felt for seryozha 
everything in this baby was charming but for some reason all this did not go deep to her heart 
on her first child though the child of an unloved father had been concentrated all the love that had never found satisfaction 
her baby girl had been born in the most painful circumstances and had not had a hundredth part of the care and thought which had been concentrated on her first child 
besides in the little girl everything was still in the future while seryozha was by now almost a personality and a personality dearly loved 
in him there was a conflict of thought and feeling he understood her he loved her he judged her she thought recalling his words and his eyes 
and she was forever  not physically only but spiritually  divided from him and it was impossible to set this right 
she gave the baby back to the nurse let her go and opened the locket in which there was seryozha s portrait when he was almost of the same age as the girl 
she got up and taking off her hat took up from a little table an album in which there were photographs of her son at different ages 
she wanted to compare them and began taking them out of the album 
she took them all out except one the latest and best photograph 
in it he was in a white smock sitting astride a chair with frowning eyes and smiling lips 
it was his best most characteristic expression 
with her little supple hands her white delicate fingers that moved with a peculiar intensity today she pulled at a corner of the photograph but the photograph had caught somewhere and she could not get it out 
there was no paper knife on the table and so pulling out the photograph that was next to her son s it was a photograph of vronsky taken at rome in a round hat and with long hair  she used it to push out her son s photograph 
 oh here is he  
she said glancing at the portrait of vronsky and she suddenly recalled that he was the cause of her present misery 
she had not once thought of him all the morning 
but now coming all at once upon that manly noble face so familiar and so dear to her she felt a sudden rush of love for him 
 but where is he 
how is it he leaves me alone in my misery  
she thought all at once with a feeling of reproach forgetting she had herself kept from him everything concerning her son 
she sent to ask him to come to her immediately with a throbbing heart she awaited him rehearsing to herself the words in which she would tell him all and the expressions of love with which he would console her 
the messenger returned with the answer that he had a visitor with him but that he would come immediately and that he asked whether she would let him bring with him prince yashvin who had just arrived in petersburg 
 he s not coming alone and since dinner yesterday he has not seen me  she thought he s not coming so that i could tell him everything but coming with yashvin  
and all at once a strange idea came to her what if he had ceased to love her 
and going over the events of the last few days it seemed to her that she saw in everything a confirmation of this terrible idea 
the fact that he had not dined at home yesterday and the fact that he had insisted on their taking separate sets of rooms in petersburg and that even now he was not coming to her alone as though he were trying to avoid meeting her face to face 
 but he ought to tell me so 
i must know that it is so 
if i knew it then i know what i should do  she said to herself utterly unable to picture to herself the position she would be in if she were convinced of his not caring for her 
she thought he had ceased to love her she felt close upon despair and consequently she felt exceptionally alert 
she rang for her maid and went to her dressing room 
as she dressed she took more care over her appearance than she had done all those days as though he might if he had grown cold to her fall in love with her again because she had dressed and arranged her hair in the way most becoming to her 
she heard the bell ring before she was ready 
when she went into the drawing room it was not he but yashvin who met her eyes 
vronsky was looking through the photographs of her son which she had forgotten on the table and he made no haste to look round at her 
 we have met already  she said putting her little hand into the huge hand of yashvin whose bashfulness was so queerly out of keeping with his immense frame and coarse face 
 we met last year at the races 
give them to me  she said with a rapid movement snatching from vronsky the photographs of her son and glancing significantly at him with flashing eyes 
 were the races good this year 
instead of them i saw the races in the corso in rome 
but you don t care for life abroad  she said with a cordial smile 
 i know you and all your tastes though i have seen so little of you  
 i m awfully sorry for that for my tastes are mostly bad  said yashvin gnawing at his left mustache 
having talked a little while and noticing that vronsky glanced at the clock yashvin asked her whether she would be staying much longer in petersburg and unbending his huge figure reached after his cap 
 not long i think  she said hesitatingly glancing at vronsky 
 so then we shan t meet again  
 come and dine with me  said anna resolutely angry it seemed with herself for her embarrassment but flushing as she always did when she defined her position before a fresh person 
 the dinner here is not good but at least you will see him 
there is no one of his old friends in the regiment alexey cares for as he does for you  
 delighted  said yashvin with a smile from which vronsky could see that he liked anna very much 
yashvin said good bye and went away vronsky stayed behind 
 are you going too  
she said to him 
 i m late already  he answered 
 run along 
i ll catch you up in a moment  he called to yashvin 
she took him by the hand and without taking her eyes off him gazed at him while she ransacked her mind for the words to say that would keep him 
 wait a minute there s something i want to say to you  and taking his broad hand she pressed it on her neck 
 oh was it right my asking him to dinner  
 you did quite right  he said with a serene smile that showed his even teeth and he kissed her hand 
 alexey you have not changed to me  
she said pressing his hand in both of hers 
 alexey i am miserable here 
when are we going away  
 soon soon 
you wouldn t believe how disagreeable our way of living here is to me too  he said and he drew away his hand 
 well go go  
she said in a tone of offense and she walked quickly away from him 
chapter    when vronsky returned home anna was not yet home 
soon after he had left some lady so they told him had come to see her and she had gone out with her 
that she had gone out without leaving word where she was going that she had not yet come back and that all the morning she had been going about somewhere without a word to him  all this together with the strange look of excitement in her face in the morning and the recollection of the hostile tone with which she had before yashvin almost snatched her son s photographs out of his hands made him serious 
he decided he absolutely must speak openly with her 
and he waited for her in her drawing room 
but anna did not return alone but brought with her her old unmarried aunt princess oblonskaya 
this was the lady who had come in the morning and with whom anna had gone out shopping 
anna appeared not to notice vronsky s worried and inquiring expression and began a lively account of her morning s shopping 
he saw that there was something working within her in her flashing eyes when they rested for a moment on him there was an intense concentration and in her words and movements there was that nervous rapidity and grace which during the early period of their intimacy had so fascinated him but which now so disturbed and alarmed him 
the dinner was laid for four 
all were gathered together and about to go into the little dining room when tushkevitch made his appearance with a message from princess betsy 
princess betsy begged her to excuse her not having come to say good bye she had been indisposed but begged anna to come to her between half past six and nine o clock 
vronsky glanced at anna at the precise limit of time so suggestive of steps having been taken that she should meet no one but anna appeared not to notice it 
 very sorry that i can t come just between half past six and nine  she said with a faint smile 
 the princess will be very sorry  
 and so am i  
 you re going no doubt to hear patti  
said tushkevitch 
 patti 
you suggest the idea to me 
i would go if it were possible to get a box  
 i can get one  tushkevitch offered his services 
 i should be very very grateful to you  said anna 
 but won t you dine with us  
vronsky gave a hardly perceptible shrug 
he was at a complete loss to understand what anna was about 
what had she brought the old princess oblonskaya home for what had she made tushkevitch stay to dinner for and most amazing of all why was she sending him for a box 
could she possibly think in her position of going to patti s benefit where all the circle of her acquaintances would be 
he looked at her with serious eyes but she responded with that defiant half mirthful half desperate look the meaning of which he could not comprehend 
at dinner anna was in aggressively high spirits  she almost flirted both with tushkevitch and with yashvin 
when they got up from dinner and tushkevitch had gone to get a box at the opera yashvin went to smoke and vronsky went down with him to his own rooms 
after sitting there for some time he ran upstairs 
anna was already dressed in a low necked gown of light silk and velvet that she had had made in paris and with costly white lace on her head framing her face and particularly becoming showing up her dazzling beauty 
 are you really going to the theater  
he said trying not to look at her 
 why do you ask with such alarm  
she said wounded again at his not looking at her 
 why shouldn t i go  
she appeared not to understand the motive of his words 
 oh of course there s no reason whatever  he said frowning 
 that s just what i say  she said willfully refusing to see the irony of his tone and quietly turning back her long perfumed glove 
 anna for god s sake 
what is the matter with you  
he said appealing to her exactly as once her husband had done 
 i don t understand what you are asking  
 you know that it s out of the question to go  
 why so 
i m not going alone 
princess varvara has gone to dress she is going with me  
he shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity and despair 
 but do you mean to say you don t know     
he began 
 but i don t care to know  
she almost shrieked 
 i don t care to 
do i regret what i have done 
no no no 
if it were all to do again from the beginning it would be the same 
for us for you and for me there is only one thing that matters whether we love each other 
other people we need not consider 
why are we living here apart and not seeing each other 
why can t i go 
i love you and i don t care for anything  she said in russian glancing at him with a peculiar gleam in her eyes that he could not understand 
 if you have not changed to me why don t you look at me  
he looked at her 
he saw all the beauty of her face and full dress always so becoming to her 
but now her beauty and elegance were just what irritated him 
 my feeling cannot change you know but i beg you i entreat you  he said again in french with a note of tender supplication in his voice but with coldness in his eyes 
she did not hear his words but she saw the coldness of his eyes and answered with irritation  and i beg you to explain why i should not go  
 because it might cause you    he hesitated 
 i don t understand 
yashvin  n est pas compromettant  and princess varvara is no worse than others 
oh here she is  
chapter    vronsky for the first time experienced a feeling of anger against anna almost a hatred for her willfully refusing to understand her own position 
this feeling was aggravated by his being unable to tell her plainly the cause of his anger 
if he had told her directly what he was thinking he would have said  in that dress with a princess only too well known to everyone to show yourself at the theater is equivalent not merely to acknowledging your position as a fallen woman but is flinging down a challenge to society that is to say cutting yourself off from it forever  
he could not say that to her 
 but how can she fail to see it and what is going on in her  
he said to himself 
he felt at the same time that his respect for her was diminished while his sense of her beauty was intensified 
he went back scowling to his rooms and sitting down beside yashvin who with his long legs stretched out on a chair was drinking brandy and seltzer water he ordered a glass of the same for himself 
 you were talking of lankovsky s powerful 
that s a fine horse and i would advise you to buy him  said yashvin glancing at his comrade s gloomy face 
 his hind quarters aren t quite first rate but the legs and head  one couldn t wish for anything better  
 i think i will take him  answered vronsky 
their conversation about horses interested him but he did not for an instant forget anna and could not help listening to the sound of steps in the corridor and looking at the clock on the chimney piece 
 anna arkadyevna gave orders to announce that she has gone to the theater  
yashvin tipping another glass of brandy into the bubbling water drank it and got up buttoning his coat 
 well let s go  he said faintly smiling under his mustache and showing by this smile that he knew the cause of vronsky s gloominess and did not attach any significance to it 
 i m not going  vronsky answered gloomily 
 well i must i promised to 
good bye then 
if you do come to the stalls you can take kruzin s stall  added yashvin as he went out 
 no i m busy  
 a wife is a care but it s worse when she s not a wife  thought yashvin as he walked out of the hotel 
vronsky left alone got up from his chair and began pacing up and down the room 
 and what s today 
the fourth night     yegor and his wife are there and my mother most likely 
of course all petersburg s there 
now she s gone in taken off her cloak and come into the light 
tushkevitch yashvin princess varvara  he pictured them to himself     what about me 
either that i m frightened or have given up to tushkevitch the right to protect her 
from every point of view  stupid stupid    
and why is she putting me in such a position  
he said with a gesture of despair 
with that gesture he knocked against the table on which there was standing the seltzer water and the decanter of brandy and almost upset it 
he tried to catch it let it slip and angrily kicked the table over and rang 
 if you care to be in my service  he said to the valet who came in you had better remember your duties 
this shouldn t be here 
you ought to have cleared away  
the valet conscious of his own innocence would have defended himself but glancing at his master he saw from his face that the only thing to do was to be silent and hurriedly threading his way in and out dropped down on the carpet and began gathering up the whole and broken glasses and bottles 
 that s not your duty send the waiter to clear away and get my dress coat out  
vronsky went into the theater at half past eight 
the performance was in full swing 
the little old box keeper recognizing vronsky as he helped him off with his fur coat called him your excellency  and suggested he should not take a number but should simply call fyodor 
in the brightly lighted corridor there was no one but the box opener and two attendants with fur cloaks on their arms listening at the doors 
through the closed doors came the sounds of the discreet  staccato  accompaniment of the orchestra and a single female voice rendering distinctly a musical phrase 
the door opened to let the box opener slip through and the phrase drawing to the end reached vronsky s hearing clearly 
but the doors were closed again at once and vronsky did not hear the end of the phrase and the cadence of the accompaniment though he knew from the thunder of applause that it was over 
when he entered the hall brilliantly lighted with chandeliers and gas jets the noise was still going on 
on the stage the singer bowing and smiling with bare shoulders flashing with diamonds was with the help of the tenor who had given her his arm gathering up the bouquets that were flying awkwardly over the footlights 
then she went up to a gentleman with glossy pomaded hair parted down the center who was stretching across the footlights holding out something to her and all the public in the stalls as well as in the boxes was in excitement craning forward shouting and clapping 
the conductor in his high chair assisted in passing the offering and straightened his white tie 
vronsky walked into the middle of the stalls and standing still began looking about him 
that day less than ever was his attention turned upon the familiar habitual surroundings the stage the noise all the familiar uninteresting particolored herd of spectators in the packed theater 
there were as always the same ladies of some sort with officers of some sort in the back of the boxes the same gaily dressed women  god knows who  and uniforms and black coats the same dirty crowd in the upper gallery and among the crowd in the boxes and in the front rows were some forty of the  real  people 
and to those oases vronsky at once directed his attention and with them he entered at once into relation 
the act was over when he went in and so he did not go straight to his brother s box but going up to the first row of stalls stopped at the footlights with serpuhovskoy who standing with one knee raised and his heel on the footlights caught sight of him in the distance and beckoned to him smiling 
vronsky had not yet seen anna 
he purposely avoided looking in her direction 
but he knew by the direction of people s eyes where she was 
he looked round discreetly but he was not seeking her expecting the worst his eyes sought for alexey alexandrovitch 
to his relief alexey alexandrovitch was not in the theater that evening 
 how little of the military man there is left in you  
serpuhovskoy was saying to him 
 a diplomat an artist something of that sort one would say  
 yes it was like going back home when i put on a black coat  answered vronsky smiling and slowly taking out his opera glass 
 well i ll own i envy you there 
when i come back from abroad and put on this  he touched his epaulets i regret my freedom  
serpuhovskoy had long given up all hope of vronsky s career but he liked him as before and was now particularly cordial to him 
 what a pity you were not in time for the first act  
vronsky listening with one ear moved his opera glass from the stalls and scanned the boxes 
near a lady in a turban and a bald old man who seemed to wave angrily in the moving opera glass vronsky suddenly caught sight of anna s head proud strikingly beautiful and smiling in the frame of lace 
she was in the fifth box twenty paces from him 
she was sitting in front and slightly turning was saying something to yashvin 
the setting of her head on her handsome broad shoulders and the restrained excitement and brilliance of her eyes and her whole face reminded him of her just as he had seen her at the ball in moscow 
but he felt utterly different towards her beauty now 
in his feeling for her now there was no element of mystery and so her beauty though it attracted him even more intensely than before gave him now a sense of injury 
she was not looking in his direction but vronsky felt that she had seen him already 
when vronsky turned the opera glass again in that direction he noticed that princess varvara was particularly red and kept laughing unnaturally and looking round at the next box 
anna folding her fan and tapping it on the red velvet was gazing away and did not see and obviously did not wish to see what was taking place in the next box 
yashvin s face wore the expression which was common when he was losing at cards 
scowling he sucked the left end of his mustache further and further into his mouth and cast sidelong glances at the next box 
in that box on the left were the kartasovs 
vronsky knew them and knew that anna was acquainted with them 
madame kartasova a thin little woman was standing up in her box and her back turned upon anna she was putting on a mantle that her husband was holding for her 
her face was pale and angry and she was talking excitedly 
kartasov a fat bald man was continually looking round at anna while he attempted to soothe his wife 
when the wife had gone out the husband lingered a long while and tried to catch anna s eye obviously anxious to bow to her 
but anna with unmistakable intention avoided noticing him and talked to yashvin whose cropped head was bent down to her 
kartasov went out without making his salutation and the box was left empty 
vronsky could not understand exactly what had passed between the kartasovs and anna but he saw that something humiliating for anna had happened 
he knew this both from what he had seen and most of all from the face of anna who he could see was taxing every nerve to carry through the part she had taken up 
and in maintaining this attitude of external composure she was completely successful 
anyone who did not know her and her circle who had not heard all the utterances of the women expressive of commiseration indignation and amazement that she should show herself in society and show herself so conspicuously with her lace and her beauty would have admired the serenity and loveliness of this woman without a suspicion that she was undergoing the sensations of a man in the stocks 
knowing that something had happened but not knowing precisely what vronsky felt a thrill of agonizing anxiety and hoping to find out something he went towards his brother s box 
purposely choosing the way round furthest from anna s box he jostled as he came out against the colonel of his old regiment talking to two acquaintances 
vronsky heard the name of madame karenina and noticed how the colonel hastened to address vronsky loudly by name with a meaning glance at his companions 
 ah vronsky 
when are you coming to the regiment 
we can t let you off without a supper 
you re one of the old set  said the colonel of his regiment 
 i can t stop awfully sorry another time  said vronsky and he ran upstairs towards his brother s box 
the old countess vronsky s mother with her steel gray curls was in his brother s box 
varya with the young princess sorokina met him in the corridor 
leaving the princess sorokina with her mother varya held out her hand to her brother in law and began immediately to speak of what interested him 
she was more excited than he had ever seen her 
 i think it s mean and hateful and madame kartasova had no right to do it 
madame karenina    she began 
 but what is it 
i don t know  
 what 
you ve not heard  
 you know i should be the last person to hear of it  
 there isn t a more spiteful creature than that madame kartasova  
 but what did she do  
 my husband told me     she has insulted madame karenina 
her husband began talking to her across the box and madame kartasova made a scene 
she said something aloud he says something insulting and went away  
 count your maman is asking for you  said the young princess sorokina peeping out of the door of the box 
 i ve been expecting you all the while  said his mother smiling sarcastically 
 you were nowhere to be seen  
her son saw that she could not suppress a smile of delight 
 good evening maman 
i have come to you  he said coldly 
 why aren t you going to  faire la cour à madame karenina  
she went on when princess sorokina had moved away  
elle fait sensation 
on oublie la patti pour elle  
 maman i have asked you not to say anything to me of that  he answered scowling 
 i m only saying what everyone s saying  
vronsky made no reply and saying a few words to princess sorokina he went away 
at the door he met his brother 
 ah alexey  
said his brother 
 how disgusting 
idiot of a woman nothing else    
i wanted to go straight to her 
let s go together  
vronsky did not hear him 
with rapid steps he went downstairs he felt that he must do something but he did not know what 
anger with her for having put herself and him in such a false position together with pity for her suffering filled his heart 
he went down and made straight for anna s box 
at her box stood stremov talking to her 
 there are no more tenors 
le moule en est brisé 
vronsky bowed to her and stopped to greet stremov 
 you came in late i think and have missed the best song  anna said to vronsky glancing ironically he thought at him 
 i am a poor judge of music  he said looking sternly at her 
 like prince yashvin  she said smiling who considers that patti sings too loud  
 thank you  she said her little hand in its long glove taking the playbill vronsky picked up and suddenly at that instant her lovely face quivered 
she got up and went into the interior of the box 
noticing in the next act that her box was empty vronsky rousing indignant hushes in the silent audience went out in the middle of a solo and drove home 
anna was already at home 
when vronsky went up to her she was in the same dress as she had worn at the theater 
she was sitting in the first armchair against the wall looking straight before her 
she looked at him and at once resumed her former position 
 anna  he said 
 you you are to blame for everything  
she cried with tears of despair and hatred in her voice getting up 
 i begged i implored you not to go i knew it would be unpleasant      unpleasant  
she cried   hideous 
as long as i live i shall never forget it 
she said it was a disgrace to sit beside me  
 a silly woman s chatter  he said but why risk it why provoke     
 i hate your calm 
you ought not to have brought me to this 
if you had loved me     anna 
how does the question of my love come in  
 oh if you loved me as i love if you were tortured as i am     
she said looking at him with an expression of terror 
he was sorry for her and angry notwithstanding 
he assured her of his love because he saw that this was the only means of soothing her and he did not reproach her in words but in his heart he reproached her 
and the asseverations of his love which seemed to him so vulgar that he was ashamed to utter them she drank in eagerly and gradually became calmer 
the next day completely reconciled they left for the country 
part      chapter     darya alexandrovna spent the summer with her children at pokrovskoe at her sister kitty levin s 
the house on her own estate was quite in ruins and levin and his wife had persuaded her to spend the summer with them 
stepan arkadyevitch greatly approved of the arrangement 
he said he was very sorry his official duties prevented him from spending the summer in the country with his family which would have been the greatest happiness for him and remaining in moscow he came down to the country from time to time for a day or two 
besides the oblonskys with all their children and their governess the old princess too came to stay that summer with the levins as she considered it her duty to watch over her inexperienced daughter in her  interesting condition 
moreover varenka kitty s friend abroad kept her promise to come to kitty when she was married and stayed with her friend 
all of these were friends or relations of levin s wife 
and though he liked them all he rather regretted his own levin world and ways which was smothered by this influx of the shtcherbatsky element  as he called it to himself 
of his own relations there stayed with him only sergey ivanovitch but he too was a man of the koznishev and not the levin stamp so that the levin spirit was utterly obliterated 
in the levins house so long deserted there were now so many people that almost all the rooms were occupied and almost every day it happened that the old princess sitting down to table counted them all over and put the thirteenth grandson or granddaughter at a separate table 
and kitty with her careful housekeeping had no little trouble to get all the chickens turkeys and geese of which so many were needed to satisfy the summer appetites of the visitors and children 
the whole family were sitting at dinner 
dolly s children with their governess and varenka were making plans for going to look for mushrooms 
sergey ivanovitch who was looked up to by all the party for his intellect and learning with a respect that almost amounted to awe surprised everyone by joining in the conversation about mushrooms 
 take me with you 
i am very fond of picking mushrooms  he said looking at varenka i think it s a very nice occupation  
 oh we shall be delighted  answered varenka coloring a little 
kitty exchanged meaningful glances with dolly 
the proposal of the learned and intellectual sergey ivanovitch to go looking for mushrooms with varenka confirmed certain theories of kitty s with which her mind had been very busy of late 
she made haste to address some remark to her mother so that her look should not be noticed 
after dinner sergey ivanovitch sat with his cup of coffee at the drawing room window and while he took part in a conversation he had begun with his brother he watched the door through which the children would start on the mushroom picking expedition 
levin was sitting in the window near his brother 
kitty stood beside her husband evidently awaiting the end of a conversation that had no interest for her in order to tell him something 
 you have changed in many respects since your marriage and for the better  said sergey ivanovitch smiling to kitty and obviously little interested in the conversation but you have remained true to your passion for defending the most paradoxical theories  
 katya it s not good for you to stand  her husband said to her putting a chair for her and looking significantly at her 
 oh and there s no time either  added sergey ivanovitch seeing the children running out 
at the head of them all tanya galloped sideways in her tightly drawn stockings and waving a basket and sergey ivanovitch s hat she ran straight up to him 
boldly running up to sergey ivanovitch with shining eyes so like her father s fine eyes she handed him his hat and made as though she would put it on for him softening her freedom by a shy and friendly smile 
 varenka s waiting  she said carefully putting his hat on seeing from sergey ivanovitch s smile that she might do so 
varenka was standing at the door dressed in a yellow print gown with a white kerchief on her head 
 i m coming i m coming varvara andreevna  said sergey ivanovitch finishing his cup of coffee and putting into their separate pockets his handkerchief and cigar case 
 and how sweet my varenka is 
eh  
said kitty to her husband as soon as sergey ivanovitch rose 
she spoke so that sergey ivanovitch could hear and it was clear that she meant him to do so 
 and how good looking she is  such a refined beauty 
varenka  
kitty shouted 
 shall you be in the mill copse 
we ll come out to you  
 you certainly forget your condition kitty  said the old princess hurriedly coming out at the door 
 you mustn t shout like that  
varenka hearing kitty s voice and her mother s reprimand went with light rapid steps up to kitty 
the rapidity of her movement her flushed and eager face everything betrayed that something out of the common was going on in her 
kitty knew what this was and had been watching her intently 
she called varenka at that moment merely in order mentally to give her a blessing for the important event which as kitty fancied was bound to come to pass that day after dinner in the wood 
 varenka i should be very happy if a certain something were to happen  she whispered as she kissed her 
 and are you coming with us  
varenka said to levin in confusion pretending not to have heard what had been said 
 i am coming but only as far as the threshing floor and there i shall stop  
 why what do you want there  
said kitty 
 i must go to have a look at the new wagons and to check the invoice  said levin and where will you be  
 on the terrace  
chapter    on the terrace were assembled all the ladies of the party 
they always liked sitting there after dinner and that day they had work to do there too 
besides the sewing and knitting of baby clothes with which all of them were busy that afternoon jam was being made on the terrace by a method new to agafea mihalovna without the addition of water 
kitty had introduced this new method which had been in use in her home 
agafea mihalovna to whom the task of jam making had always been intrusted considering that what had been done in the levin household could not be amiss had nevertheless put water with the strawberries maintaining that the jam could not be made without it 
she had been caught in the act and was now making jam before everyone and it was to be proved to her conclusively that jam could be very well made without water 
agafea mihalovna her face heated and angry her hair untidy and her thin arms bare to the elbows was turning the preserving pan over the charcoal stove looking darkly at the raspberries and devoutly hoping they would stick and not cook properly 
the princess conscious that agafea mihalovna s wrath must be chiefly directed against her as the person responsible for the raspberry jam making tried to appear to be absorbed in other things and not interested in the jam talked of other matters but cast stealthy glances in the direction of the stove 
 i always buy my maids dresses myself of some cheap material  the princess said continuing the previous conversation 
 isn t it time to skim it my dear  
she added addressing agafea mihalovna 
 there s not the slightest need for you to do it and it s hot for you  she said stopping kitty 
 i ll do it  said dolly and getting up she carefully passed the spoon over the frothing sugar and from time to time shook off the clinging jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate that was covered with yellow red scum and blood colored syrup 
 how they ll enjoy this at tea time  
she thought of her children remembering how she herself as a child had wondered how it was the grown up people did not eat what was best of all  the scum of the jam 
 stiva says it s much better to give money  
dolly took up meanwhile the weighty subject under discussion what presents should be made to servants 
 but     money s out of the question  
the princess and kitty exclaimed with one voice 
 they appreciate a present     well last year for instance i bought our matrona semyenovna not a poplin but something of that sort  said the princess 
 i remember she was wearing it on your nameday  
 a charming pattern  so simple and refined   i should have liked it myself if she hadn t had it 
something like varenka s 
so pretty and inexpensive  
 well now i think it s done  said dolly dropping the syrup from the spoon 
 when it sets as it drops it s ready 
cook it a little longer agafea mihalovna  
 the flies  
said agafea mihalovna angrily 
 it ll be just the same  she added 
 ah 
how sweet it is 
don t frighten it  
kitty said suddenly looking at a sparrow that had settled on the step and was pecking at the center of a raspberry 
 yes but you keep a little further from the stove  said her mother  
à propos de varenka  said kitty speaking in french as they had been doing all the while so that agafea mihalovna should not understand them you know mamma i somehow expect things to be settled today 
you know what i mean 
how splendid it would be  
 but what a famous matchmaker she is  
said dolly 
 how carefully and cleverly she throws them together     
 no tell me mamma what do you think  
 why what is one to think 
he  he  meant sergey ivanovitch might at any time have been a match for anyone in russia now of course he s not quite a young man still i know ever so many girls would be glad to marry him even now     she s a very nice girl but he might     oh no mamma do understand why for him and for her too nothing better could be imagined 
in the first place she s charming  
said kitty crooking one of her fingers 
 he thinks her very attractive that s certain  assented dolly 
 then he occupies such a position in society that he has no need to look for either fortune or position in his wife 
all he needs is a good sweet wife  a restful one  
 well with her he would certainly be restful  dolly assented 
 thirdly that she should love him 
and so it is   that is it would be so splendid    i look forward to seeing them coming out of the forest  and everything settled 
i shall see at once by their eyes 
i should be so delighted 
what do you think dolly  
 but don t excite yourself 
it s not at all the thing for you to be excited  said her mother 
 oh i m not excited mamma 
i fancy he will make her an offer today  
 ah that s so strange how and when a man makes an offer    
there is a sort of barrier and all at once it s broken down  said dolly smiling pensively and recalling her past with stepan arkadyevitch 
 mamma how did papa make you an offer  
kitty asked suddenly 
 there was nothing out of the way it was very simple  answered the princess but her face beamed all over at the recollection 
 oh but how was it 
you loved him anyway before you were allowed to speak  
kitty felt a peculiar pleasure in being able now to talk to her mother on equal terms about those questions of such paramount interest in a woman s life 
 of course i did he had come to stay with us in the country  
 but how was it settled between you mamma  
 you imagine i dare say that you invented something quite new 
it s always just the same it was settled by the eyes by smiles     how nicely you said that mamma 
it s just by the eyes by smiles that it s done  dolly assented 
 but what words did he say  
 what did kostya say to you  
 he wrote it in chalk 
it was wonderful     how long ago it seems  
she said 
and the three women all fell to musing on the same thing 
kitty was the first to break the silence 
she remembered all that last winter before her marriage and her passion for vronsky 
 there s one thing   that old love affair of varenka s  she said a natural chain of ideas bringing her to this point 
 i should have liked to say something to sergey ivanovitch to prepare him 
they re all  all men i mean  she added awfully jealous over our past  
 not all  said dolly 
 you judge by your own husband 
it makes him miserable even now to remember vronsky 
eh 
that s true isn t it  
 yes  kitty answered a pensive smile in her eyes 
 but i really don t know  the mother put in in defense of her motherly care of her daughter what there was in your past that could worry him 
that vronsky paid you attentions  that happens to every girl  
 oh yes but we didn t mean that  kitty said flushing a little 
 no let me speak  her mother went on why you yourself would not let me have a talk to vronsky 
don t you remember  
 oh mamma  
said kitty with an expression of suffering 
 there s no keeping you young people in check nowadays    
your friendship could not have gone beyond what was suitable 
i should myself have called upon him to explain himself 
but my darling it s not right for you to be agitated 
please remember that and calm yourself  
 i m perfectly calm maman  
 how happy it was for kitty that anna came then  said dolly and how unhappy for her 
it turned out quite the opposite  she said struck by her own ideas 
 then anna was so happy and kitty thought herself unhappy 
now it is just the opposite 
i often think of her  
 a nice person to think about 
horrid repulsive woman  no heart  said her mother who could not forget that kitty had married not vronsky but levin 
 what do you want to talk of it for  
kitty said with annoyance 
 i never think about it and i don t want to think of it    and i don t want to think of it  she said catching the sound of her husband s well known step on the steps of the terrace 
 what s that you don t want to think about  
inquired levin coming onto the terrace 
but no one answered him and he did not repeat the question 
 i m sorry i ve broken in on your feminine parliament  he said looking round on every one discontentedly and perceiving that they had been talking of something which they would not talk about before him 
for a second he felt that he was sharing the feeling of agafea mihalovna vexation at their making jam without water and altogether at the outside shtcherbatsky element 
he smiled however and went up to kitty 
 well how are you  
he asked her looking at her with the expression with which everyone looked at her now 
 oh very well  said kitty smiling and how have things gone with you  
 the wagons held three times as much as the old carts did 
well are we going for the children 
i ve ordered the horses to be put in  
 what 
you want to take kitty in the wagonette  
her mother said reproachfully 
 yes at a walking pace princess  
levin never called the princess maman as men often do call their mothers in law and the princess disliked his not doing so 
but though he liked and respected the princess levin could not call her so without a sense of profaning his feeling for his dead mother 
 come with us maman  said kitty 
 i don t like to see such imprudence  
 well i ll walk then i m so well  
kitty got up and went to her husband and took his hand 
 you may be well but everything in moderation  said the princess 
 well agafea mihalovna is the jam done  
said levin smiling to agafea mihalovna and trying to cheer her up 
 is it all right in the new way  
 i suppose it s all right 
for our notions it s boiled too long  
 it ll be all the better agafea mihalovna it won t mildew even though our ice has begun to thaw already so that we ve no cool cellar to store it  said kitty at once divining her husband s motive and addressing the old housekeeper with the same feeling but your pickle s so good that mamma says she never tasted any like it  she added smiling and putting her kerchief straight 
agafea mihalovna looked angrily at kitty 
 you needn t try to console me mistress 
i need only to look at you with him and i feel happy  she said and something in the rough familiarity of that  with him  touched kitty 
 come along with us to look for mushrooms you will show us the best places  
agafea mihalovna smiled and shook her head as though to say i should like to be angry with you too but i can t  
 do it please by my receipt  said the princess put some paper over the jam and moisten it with a little rum and without even ice it will never go mildewy  
chapter     kitty was particularly glad of a chance of being alone with her husband for she had noticed the shade of mortification that had passed over his face  always so quick to reflect every feeling  at the moment when he had come onto the terrace and asked what they were talking of and had got no answer 
when they had set off on foot ahead of the others and had come out of sight of the house onto the beaten dusty road marked with rusty wheels and sprinkled with grains of corn she clung faster to his arm and pressed it closer to her 
he had quite forgotten the momentary unpleasant impression and alone with her he felt now that the thought of her approaching motherhood was never for a moment absent from his mind a new and delicious bliss quite pure from all alloy of sense in the being near to the woman he loved 
there was no need of speech yet he longed to hear the sound of her voice which like her eyes had changed since she had been with child 
in her voice as in her eyes there was that softness and gravity which is found in people continually concentrated on some cherished pursuit 
 so you re not tired 
lean more on me  said he 
 no i m so glad of a chance of being alone with you and i must own though i m happy with them i do regret our winter evenings alone  
 that was good but this is even better 
both are better  he said squeezing her hand 
 do you know what we were talking about when you came in  
 about jam  
 oh yes about jam too but afterwards about how men make offers  
 ah  
said levin listening more to the sound of her voice than to the words she was saying and all the while paying attention to the road which passed now through the forest and avoiding places where she might make a false step 
 and about sergey ivanovitch and varenka 
you ve noticed    
i m very anxious for it  she went on 
 what do you think about it  
and she peeped into his face 
 i don t know what to think  levin answered smiling 
 sergey seems very strange to me in that way 
i told you you know     yes that he was in love with that girl who died      that was when i was a child i know about it from hearsay and tradition 
i remember him then 
he was wonderfully sweet 
but i ve watched him since with women he is friendly some of them he likes but one feels that to him they re simply people not women  
 yes but now with varenka   i fancy there s something     perhaps there is    
but one has to know him    
he s a peculiar wonderful person 
he lives a spiritual life only 
he s too pure too exalted a nature  
 why 
would this lower him then  
 no but he s so used to a spiritual life that he can t reconcile himself with actual fact and varenka is after all fact  
levin had grown used by now to uttering his thought boldly without taking the trouble of clothing it in exact language 
he knew that his wife in such moments of loving tenderness as now would understand what he meant to say from a hint and she did understand him 
 yes but there s not so much of that actual fact about her as about me 
i can see that he would never have cared for me 
she is altogether spiritual  
 oh no he is so fond of you and i am always so glad when my people like you      yes he s very nice to me but     it s not as it was with poor nikolay   you really cared for each other  levin finished 
 why not speak of him  
he added 
 i sometimes blame myself for not it ends in one s forgetting 
ah how terrible and dear he was    
yes what were we talking about  
levin said after a pause 
 you think he can t fall in love  said kitty translating into her own language 
 it s not so much that he can t fall in love  levin said smiling but he has not the weakness necessary    
i ve always envied him and even now when i m so happy i still envy him  
 you envy him for not being able to fall in love  
 i envy him for being better than i  said levin 
 he does not live for himself 
his whole life is subordinated to his duty 
and that s why he can be calm and contented  
 and you  
kitty asked with an ironical and loving smile 
she could never have explained the chain of thought that made her smile but the last link in it was that her husband in exalting his brother and abasing himself was not quite sincere 
kitty knew that this insincerity came from his love for his brother from his sense of shame at being too happy and above all from his unflagging craving to be better  she loved it in him and so she smiled 
 and you 
what are you dissatisfied with  
she asked with the same smile 
her disbelief in his self dissatisfaction delighted him and unconsciously he tried to draw her into giving utterance to the grounds of her disbelief 
 i am happy but dissatisfied with myself    he said 
 why how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy  
 well how shall i say    
in my heart i really care for nothing whatever but that you should not stumble  see 
oh but really you mustn t skip about like that  
he cried breaking off to scold her for too agile a movement in stepping over a branch that lay in the path 
 but when i think about myself and compare myself with others especially with my brother i feel i m a poor creature  
 but in what way  
kitty pursued with the same smile 
 don t you too work for others 
what about your co operative settlement and your work on the estate and your book     
 oh but i feel and particularly just now  it s your fault  he said pressing her hand   that all that doesn t count 
i do it in a way halfheartedly 
if i could care for all that as i care for you    
instead of that i do it in these days like a task that is set me  
 well what would you say about papa  
asked kitty 
 is he a poor creature then as he does nothing for the public good  
 he   no 
but then one must have the simplicity the straightforwardness the goodness of your father and i haven t got that 
i do nothing and i fret about it 
it s all your doing 
before there was you  and  this  too  he added with a glance towards her waist that she understood   i put all my energies into work now i can t and i m ashamed i do it just as though it were a task set me i m pretending      well but would you like to change this minute with sergey ivanovitch  
said kitty 
 would you like to do this work for the general good and to love the task set you as he does and nothing else  
 of course not  said levin 
 but i m so happy that i don t understand anything 
so you think he ll make her an offer today  
he added after a brief silence 
 i think so and i don t think so 
only i m awfully anxious for it 
here wait a minute  
she stooped down and picked a wild camomile at the edge of the path 
 come count he does propose he doesn t  she said giving him the flower 
 he does he doesn t  said levin tearing off the white petals 
 no no  
kitty snatching at his hand stopped him 
she had been watching his fingers with interest 
 you picked off two  
 oh but see this little one shan t count to make up  said levin tearing off a little half grown petal 
 here s the wagonette overtaking us  
 aren t you tired kitty  
called the princess 
 not in the least  
 if you are you can get in as the horses are quiet and walking  
but it was not worth while to get in they were quite near the place and all walked on together 
chapter   varenka with her white kerchief on her black hair surrounded by the children gaily and good humoredly looking after them and at the same time visibly excited at the possibility of receiving a declaration from the man she cared for was very attractive 
sergey ivanovitch walked beside her and never left off admiring her 
looking at her he recalled all the delightful things he had heard from her lips all the good he knew about her and became more and more conscious that the feeling he had for her was something special that he had felt long long ago and only once in his early youth 
the feeling of happiness in being near her continually grew and at last reached such a point that as he put a huge slender stalked agaric fungus in her basket he looked straight into her face and noticing the flush of glad and alarmed excitement that overspread her face he was confused himself and smiled to her in silence a smile that said too much 
 if so  he said to himself i ought to think it over and make up my mind and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment  
 i m going to pick by myself apart from all the rest or else my efforts will make no show  he said and he left the edge of the forest where they were walking on low silky grass between old birch trees standing far apart and went more into the heart of the wood where between the white birch trunks there were gray trunks of aspen and dark bushes of hazel 
walking some forty paces away sergey ivanovitch knowing he was out of sight stood still behind a bushy spindle tree in full flower with its rosy red catkins 
it was perfectly still all round him 
only overhead in the birches under which he stood the flies like a swarm of bees buzzed unceasingly and from time to time the children s voices were floated across to him 
all at once he heard not far from the edge of the wood the sound of varenka s contralto voice calling grisha and a smile of delight passed over sergey ivanovitch s face 
conscious of this smile he shook his head disapprovingly at his own condition and taking out a cigar he began lighting it 
for a long while he could not get a match to light against the trunk of a birch tree 
the soft scales of the white bark rubbed off the phosphorus and the light went out 
at last one of the matches burned and the fragrant cigar smoke hovering uncertainly in flat wide coils stretched away forwards and upwards over a bush under the overhanging branches of a birch tree 
watching the streak of smoke sergey ivanovitch walked gently on deliberating on his position 
 why not  
he thought 
 if it were only a passing fancy or a passion if it were only this attraction  this mutual attraction i can call it a  mutual  attraction  but if i felt that it was in contradiction with the whole bent of my life  if i felt that in giving way to this attraction i should be false to my vocation and my duty   but it s not so 
the only thing i can say against it is that when i lost marie i said to myself that i would remain faithful to her memory 
that s the only thing i can say against my feeling     that s a great thing  sergey ivanovitch said to himself feeling at the same time that this consideration had not the slightest importance for him personally but would only perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eyes of others 
 but apart from that however much i searched i should never find anything to say against my feeling 
if i were choosing by considerations of suitability alone i could not have found anything better  
however many women and girls he thought of whom he knew he could not think of a girl who united to such a degree all positively all the qualities he would wish to see in his wife 
she had all the charm and freshness of youth but she was not a child and if she loved him she loved him consciously as a woman ought to love that was one thing 
another point she was not only far from being worldly but had an unmistakable distaste for worldly society and at the same time she knew the world and had all the ways of a woman of the best society which were absolutely essential to sergey ivanovitch s conception of the woman who was to share his life 
thirdly she was religious and not like a child unconsciously religious and good as kitty for example was but her life was founded on religious principles 
even in trifling matters sergey ivanovitch found in her all that he wanted in his wife she was poor and alone in the world so she would not bring with her a mass of relations and their influence into her husband s house as he saw now in kitty s case 
she would owe everything to her husband which was what he had always desired too for his future family life 
and this girl who united all these qualities loved him 
he was a modest man but he could not help seeing it 
and he loved her 
there was one consideration against it  his age 
but he came of a long lived family he had not a single gray hair no one would have taken him for forty and he remembered varenka s saying that it was only in russia that men of fifty thought themselves old and that in france a man of fifty considers himself  dans la force de l âge  while a man of forty is  un jeune homme 
but what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago 
was it not youth to feel as he felt now when coming from the other side to the edge of the wood he saw in the glowing light of the slanting sunbeams the gracious figure of varenka in her yellow gown with her basket walking lightly by the trunk of an old birch tree and when this impression of the sight of varenka blended so harmoniously with the beauty of the view of the yellow oatfield lying bathed in the slanting sunshine and beyond it the distant ancient forest flecked with yellow and melting into the blue of the distance 
his heart throbbed joyously 
a softened feeling came over him 
he felt that he had made up his mind 
varenka who had just crouched down to pick a mushroom rose with a supple movement and looked round 
flinging away the cigar sergey ivanovitch advanced with resolute steps towards her 
chapter    varvara andreevna when i was very young i set before myself the ideal of the woman i loved and should be happy to call my wife 
i have lived through a long life and now for the first time i have met what i sought  in you 
i love you and offer you my hand  
sergey ivanovitch was saying this to himself while he was ten paces from varvara 
kneeling down with her hands over the mushrooms to guard them from grisha she was calling little masha 
 come here little ones 
there are so many  
she was saying in her sweet deep voice 
seeing sergey ivanovitch approaching she did not get up and did not change her position but everything told him that she felt his presence and was glad of it 
 well did you find some  
she asked from under the white kerchief turning her handsome gently smiling face to him 
 not one  said sergey ivanovitch 
 did you  
she did not answer busy with the children who thronged about her 
 that one too near the twig  she pointed out to little masha a little fungus split in half across its rosy cap by the dry grass from under which it thrust itself 
varenka got up while masha picked the fungus breaking it into two white halves 
 this brings back my childhood  she added moving apart from the children beside sergey ivanovitch 
they walked on for some steps in silence 
varenka saw that he wanted to speak she guessed of what and felt faint with joy and panic 
they had walked so far away that no one could hear them now but still he did not begin to speak 
it would have been better for varenka to be silent 
after a silence it would have been easier for them to say what they wanted to say than after talking about mushrooms 
but against her own will as it were accidentally varenka said  so you found nothing 
in the middle of the wood there are always fewer though  
sergey ivanovitch sighed and made no answer 
he was annoyed that she had spoken about the mushrooms 
he wanted to bring her back to the first words she had uttered about her childhood but after a pause of some length as though against his own will he made an observation in response to her last words 
 i have heard that the white edible funguses are found principally at the edge of the wood though i can t tell them apart  
some minutes more passed they moved still further away from the children and were quite alone 
varenka s heart throbbed so that she heard it beating and felt that she was turning red and pale and red again 
to be the wife of a man like koznishev after her position with madame stahl was to her imagination the height of happiness 
besides she was almost certain that she was in love with him 
and this moment it would have to be decided 
she felt frightened 
she dreaded both his speaking and his not speaking 
now or never it must be said  that sergey ivanovitch felt too 
everything in the expression the flushed cheeks and the downcast eyes of varenka betrayed a painful suspense 
sergey ivanovitch saw it and felt sorry for her 
he felt even that to say nothing now would be a slight to her 
rapidly in his own mind he ran over all the arguments in support of his decision 
he even said over to himself the words in which he meant to put his offer but instead of those words some utterly unexpected reflection that occurred to him made him ask  what is the difference between the birch mushroom and the white mushroom  
varenka s lips quivered with emotion as she answered  in the top part there is scarcely any difference it s in the stalk  
and as soon as these words were uttered both he and she felt that it was over that what was to have been said would not be said and their emotion which had up to then been continually growing more intense began to subside 
 the birch mushroom s stalk suggests a dark man s chin after two days without shaving  said sergey ivanovitch speaking quite calmly now 
 yes that s true  answered varenka smiling and unconsciously the direction of their walk changed 
they began to turn towards the children 
varenka felt both sore and ashamed at the same time she had a sense of relief 
when he had got home again and went over the whole subject sergey ivanovitch thought his previous decision had been a mistaken one 
he could not be false to the memory of marie 
 gently children gently  
levin shouted quite angrily to the children standing before his wife to protect her when the crowd of children flew with shrieks of delight to meet them 
behind the children sergey ivanovitch and varenka walked out of the wood 
kitty had no need to ask varenka she saw from the calm and somewhat crestfallen faces of both that her plans had not come off 
 well  
her husband questioned her as they were going home again 
 it doesn t bite  said kitty her smile and manner of speaking recalling her father a likeness levin often noticed with pleasure 
 how doesn t bite  
 i ll show you  she said taking her husband s hand lifting it to her mouth and just faintly brushing it with closed lips 
 like a kiss on a priest s hand  
 which didn t it bite with  
he said laughing 
 both 
but it should have been like this     there are some peasants coming     oh they didn t see  
chapter    during the time of the children s tea the grown up people sat in the balcony and talked as though nothing had happened though they all especially sergey ivanovitch and varenka were very well aware that there had happened an event which though negative was of very great importance 
they both had the same feeling rather like that of a schoolboy after an examination which has left him in the same class or shut him out of the school forever 
everyone present feeling too that something had happened talked eagerly about extraneous subjects 
levin and kitty were particularly happy and conscious of their love that evening 
and their happiness in their love seemed to imply a disagreeable slur on those who would have liked to feel the same and could not  and they felt a prick of conscience 
 mark my words alexander will not come  said the old princess 
that evening they were expecting stepan arkadyevitch to come down by train and the old prince had written that possibly he might come too 
 and i know why  the princess went on he says that young people ought to be left alone for a while at first  
 but papa has left us alone 
we ve never seen him  said kitty 
 besides we re not young people   we re old married people by now  
 only if he doesn t come i shall say good bye to you children  said the princess sighing mournfully 
 what nonsense mamma  
both the daughters fell upon her at once 
 how do you suppose he is feeling 
why now     and suddenly there was an unexpected quiver in the princess s voice 
her daughters were silent and looked at one another 
 maman always finds something to be miserable about  they said in that glance 
they did not know that happy as the princess was in her daughter s house and useful as she felt herself to be there she had been extremely miserable both on her own account and her husband s ever since they had married their last and favorite daughter and the old home had been left empty 
 what is it agafea mihalovna  
kitty asked suddenly of agafea mihalovna who was standing with a mysterious air and a face full of meaning 
 about supper  
 well that s right  said dolly you go and arrange about it and i ll go and hear grisha repeat his lesson or else he will have nothing done all day  
 that s my lesson 
no dolly i m going  said levin jumping up 
grisha who was by now at a high school had to go over the lessons of the term in the summer holidays 
darya alexandrovna who had been studying latin with her son in moscow before had made it a rule on coming to the levins to go over with him at least once a day the most difficult lessons of latin and arithmetic 
levin had offered to take her place but the mother having once overheard levin s lesson and noticing that it was not given exactly as the teacher in moscow had given it said resolutely though with much embarrassment and anxiety not to mortify levin that they must keep strictly to the book as the teacher had done and that she had better undertake it again herself 
levin was amazed both at stepan arkadyevitch who by neglecting his duty threw upon the mother the supervision of studies of which she had no comprehension and at the teachers for teaching the children so badly 
but he promised his sister in law to give the lessons exactly as she wished 
and he went on teaching grisha not in his own way but by the book and so took little interest in it and often forgot the hour of the lesson 
so it had been today 
 no i m going dolly you sit still  he said 
 we ll do it all properly like the book 
only when stiva comes and we go out shooting then we shall have to miss it  
and levin went to grisha 
varenka was saying the same thing to kitty 
even in the happy well ordered household of the levins varenka had succeeded in making herself useful 
 i ll see to the supper you sit still  she said and got up to go to agafea mihalovna 
 yes yes most likely they ve not been able to get chickens 
if so ours     agafea mihalovna and i will see about it  and varenka vanished with her 
 what a nice girl  
said the princess 
 not nice maman she s an exquisite girl there s no one else like her  
 so you are expecting stepan arkadyevitch today  
said sergey ivanovitch evidently not disposed to pursue the conversation about varenka 
 it would be difficult to find two sons in law more unlike than yours  he said with a subtle smile 
 one all movement only living in society like a fish in water the other our kostya lively alert quick in everything but as soon as he is in society he either sinks into apathy or struggles helplessly like a fish on land  
 yes he s very heedless  said the princess addressing sergey ivanovitch 
 i ve been meaning indeed to ask you to tell him that it s out of the question for her she indicated kitty to stay here that she positively must come to moscow 
he talks of getting a doctor down     maman he ll do everything he has agreed to everything  kitty said angry with her mother for appealing to sergey ivanovitch to judge in such a matter 
in the middle of their conversation they heard the snorting of horses and the sound of wheels on the gravel 
dolly had not time to get up to go and meet her husband when from the window of the room below where grisha was having his lesson levin leaped out and helped grisha out after him 
 it s stiva  
levin shouted from under the balcony 
 we ve finished dolly don t be afraid  
he added and started running like a boy to meet the carriage  
is ea id ejus ejus ejus 
shouted grisha skipping along the avenue 
 and some one else too 
papa of course  
cried levin stopping at the entrance of the avenue 
 kitty don t come down the steep staircase go round  
but levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the carriage for the old prince 
as he got nearer to the carriage he saw beside stepan arkadyevitch not the prince but a handsome stout young man in a scotch cap with long ends of ribbon behind 
this was vassenka veslovsky a distant cousin of the shtcherbatskys a brilliant young gentleman in petersburg and moscow society 
 a capital fellow and a keen sportsman  as stepan arkadyevitch said introducing him 
not a whit abashed by the disappointment caused by his having come in place of the old prince veslovsky greeted levin gaily claiming acquaintance with him in the past and snatching up grisha into the carriage lifted him over the pointer that stepan arkadyevitch had brought with him 
levin did not get into the carriage but walked behind 
he was rather vexed at the non arrival of the old prince whom he liked more and more the more he saw of him and also at the arrival of this vassenka veslovsky a quite uncongenial and superfluous person 
he seemed to him still more uncongenial and superfluous when on approaching the steps where the whole party children and grown up were gathered together in much excitement levin saw vassenka veslovsky with a particularly warm and gallant air kissing kitty s hand 
 your wife and i are cousins and very old friends  said vassenka veslovsky once more shaking levin s hand with great warmth 
 well are there plenty of birds  
stepan arkadyevitch said to levin hardly leaving time for everyone to utter their greetings 
 we ve come with the most savage intentions 
why maman they ve not been in moscow since 
look tanya here s something for you 
get it please it s in the carriage behind  
he talked in all directions 
 how pretty you ve grown dolly  he said to his wife once more kissing her hand holding it in one of his and patting it with the other 
levin who a minute before had been in the happiest frame of mind now looked darkly at everyone and everything displeased him 
 who was it he kissed yesterday with those lips  
he thought looking at stepan arkadyevitch s tender demonstrations to his wife 
he looked at dolly and he did not like her either 
 she doesn t believe in his love 
so what is she so pleased about 
revolting  
thought levin 
he looked at the princess who had been so dear to him a minute before and he did not like the manner in which she welcomed this vassenka with his ribbons just as though she were in her own house 
even sergey ivanovitch who had come out too onto the steps seemed to him unpleasant with the show of cordiality with which he met stepan arkadyevitch though levin knew that his brother neither liked nor respected oblonsky 
and varenka even she seemed hateful with her air  sainte nitouche  making the acquaintance of this gentleman while all the while she was thinking of nothing but getting married 
and more hateful than anyone was kitty for falling in with the tone of gaiety with which this gentleman regarded his visit in the country as though it were a holiday for himself and everyone else 
and above all unpleasant was that particular smile with which she responded to his smile 
noisily talking they all went into the house but as soon as they were all seated levin turned and went out 
kitty saw something was wrong with her husband 
she tried to seize a moment to speak to him alone but he made haste to get away from her saying he was wanted at the counting house 
it was long since his own work on the estate had seemed to him so important as at that moment 
 it s all holiday for them  he thought but these are no holiday matters they won t wait and there s no living without them  
chapter    levin came back to the house only when they sent to summon him to supper 
on the stairs were standing kitty and agafea mihalovna consulting about wines for supper 
 but why are you making all this fuss 
have what we usually do  
 no stiva doesn t drink   kostya stop what s the matter  
kitty began hurrying after him but he strode ruthlessly away to the dining room without waiting for her and at once joined in the lively general conversation which was being maintained there by vassenka veslovsky and stepan arkadyevitch 
 well what do you say are we going shooting tomorrow  
said stepan arkadyevitch 
 please do let s go  said veslovsky moving to another chair where he sat down sideways with one fat leg crossed under him 
 i shall be delighted we will go 
and have you had any shooting yet this year  
said levin to veslovsky looking intently at his leg but speaking with that forced amiability that kitty knew so well in him and that was so out of keeping with him 
 i can t answer for our finding grouse but there are plenty of snipe 
only we ought to start early 
you re not tired 
aren t you tired stiva  
 me tired 
i ve never been tired yet 
suppose we stay up all night 
let s go for a walk  
 yes really let s not go to bed at all 
capital  
veslovsky chimed in 
 oh we all know you can do without sleep and keep other people up too  dolly said to her husband with that faint note of irony in her voice which she almost always had now with her husband 
 but to my thinking it s time for bed now    
i m going i don t want supper  
 no do stay a little dolly  said stepan arkadyevitch going round to her side behind the table where they were having supper 
 i ve so much still to tell you  
 nothing really i suppose  
 do you know veslovsky has been at anna s and he s going to them again 
you know they re hardly fifty miles from you and i too must certainly go over there 
veslovsky come here  
vassenka crossed over to the ladies and sat down beside kitty 
 ah do tell me please you have stayed with her 
how was she  
darya alexandrovna appealed to him 
levin was left at the other end of the table and though never pausing in his conversation with the princess and varenka he saw that there was an eager and mysterious conversation going on between stepan arkadyevitch dolly kitty and veslovsky 
and that was not all 
he saw on his wife s face an expression of real feeling as she gazed with fixed eyes on the handsome face of vassenka who was telling them something with great animation 
 it s exceedingly nice at their place  veslovsky was telling them about vronsky and anna 
 i can t of course take it upon myself to judge but in their house you feel the real feeling of home  
 what do they intend doing  
 i believe they think of going to moscow  
 how jolly it would be for us all to go over to them together 
when are you going there  
stepan arkadyevitch asked vassenka 
 i m spending july there  
 will you go  
stepan arkadyevitch said to his wife 
 i ve been wanting to a long while i shall certainly go  said dolly 
 i am sorry for her and i know her 
she s a splendid woman 
i will go alone when you go back and then i shall be in no one s way 
and it will be better indeed without you  
 to be sure  said stepan arkadyevitch 
 and you kitty  
 i 
why should i go  
kitty said flushing all over and she glanced round at her husband 
 do you know anna arkadyevna then  
veslovsky asked her 
 she s a very fascinating woman  
 yes  she answered veslovsky crimsoning still more 
she got up and walked across to her husband 
 are you going shooting then tomorrow  
she said 
his jealousy had in these few moments especially at the flush that had overspread her cheeks while she was talking to veslovsky gone far indeed 
now as he heard her words he construed them in his own fashion 
strange as it was to him afterwards to recall it it seemed to him at the moment clear that in asking whether he was going shooting all she cared to know was whether he would give that pleasure to vassenka veslovsky with whom as he fancied she was in love 
 yes i m going  he answered her in an unnatural voice disagreeable to himself 
 no better spend the day here tomorrow or dolly won t see anything of her husband and set off the day after  said kitty 
the motive of kitty s words was interpreted by levin thus don t separate me from  him 
i don t care about  your  going but do let me enjoy the society of this delightful young man  
 oh if you wish we ll stay here tomorrow  levin answered with peculiar amiability 
vassenka meanwhile utterly unsuspecting the misery his presence had occasioned got up from the table after kitty and watching her with smiling and admiring eyes he followed her 
levin saw that look 
he turned white and for a minute he could hardly breathe 
 how dare he look at my wife like that  
was the feeling that boiled within him 
 tomorrow then 
do please let us go  said vassenka sitting down on a chair and again crossing his leg as his habit was 
levin s jealousy went further still 
already he saw himself a deceived husband looked upon by his wife and her lover as simply necessary to provide them with the conveniences and pleasures of life    
but in spite of that he made polite and hospitable inquiries of vassenka about his shooting his gun and his boots and agreed to go shooting next day 
happily for levin the old princess cut short his agonies by getting up herself and advising kitty to go to bed 
but even at this point levin could not escape another agony 
as he said good night to his hostess vassenka would again have kissed her hand but kitty reddening drew back her hand and said with a naïve bluntness for which the old princess scolded her afterwards  we don t like that fashion  
in levin s eyes she was to blame for having allowed such relations to arise and still more to blame for showing so awkwardly that she did not like them 
 why how can one want to go to bed  
said stepan arkadyevitch who after drinking several glasses of wine at supper was now in his most charming and sentimental humor 
 look kitty  he said pointing to the moon which had just risen behind the lime trees   how exquisite 
veslovsky this is the time for a serenade 
you know he has a splendid voice we practiced songs together along the road 
he has brought some lovely songs with him two new ones 
varvara andreevna and he must sing some duets  
when the party had broken up stepan arkadyevitch walked a long while about the avenue with veslovsky their voices could be heard singing one of the new songs 
levin hearing these voices sat scowling in an easy chair in his wife s bedroom and maintained an obstinate silence when she asked him what was wrong 
but when at last with a timid glance she hazarded the question was there perhaps something you disliked about veslovsky  
  it all burst out and he told her all 
he was humiliated himself at what he was saying and that exasperated him all the more 
he stood facing her with his eyes glittering menacingly under his scowling brows and he squeezed his strong arms across his chest as though he were straining every nerve to hold himself in 
the expression of his face would have been grim and even cruel if it had not at the same time had a look of suffering which touched her 
his jaws were twitching and his voice kept breaking 
 you must understand that i m not jealous that s a nasty word 
i can t be jealous and believe that    
i can t say what i feel but this is awful    
i m not jealous but i m wounded humiliated that anybody  dare think that anybody dare look at you with eyes like that  
 eyes like what  
said kitty trying as conscientiously as possible to recall every word and gesture of that evening and every shade implied in them 
at the very bottom of her heart she did think there had been something precisely at the moment when he had crossed over after her to the other end of the table but she dared not own it even to herself and would have been even more unable to bring herself to say so to him and so increase his suffering 
 and what can there possibly be attractive about me as i am now     
 ah  
he cried clutching at his head you shouldn t say that    
if you had been attractive then     oh no kostya oh wait a minute oh do listen  
she said looking at him with an expression of pained commiseration 
 why what can you be thinking about 
when for me there s no one in the world no one no one    
would you like me never to see anyone  
for the first minute she had been offended at his jealousy she was angry that the slightest amusement even the most innocent should be forbidden her but now she would readily have sacrificed not merely such trifles but everything for his peace of mind to save him from the agony he was suffering 
 you must understand the horror and comedy of my position  he went on in a desperate whisper that he s in my house that he s done nothing improper positively except his free and easy airs and the way he sits on his legs 
he thinks it s the best possible form and so i m obliged to be civil to him  
 but kostya you re exaggerating  said kitty at the bottom of her heart rejoicing at the depth of his love for her shown now in his jealousy 
 the most awful part of it all is that you re just as you always are and especially now when to me you re something sacred and we re so happy so particularly happy  and all of a sudden a little wretch    
he s not a little wretch why should i abuse him 
i have nothing to do with him 
but why should my and your happiness     do you know i understand now what it s all come from  kitty was beginning 
 well what 
what  
 i saw how you looked while we were talking at supper  
 well well  
levin said in dismay 
she told him what they had been talking about 
and as she told him she was breathless with emotion 
levin was silent for a space then he scanned her pale and distressed face and suddenly he clutched at his head 
 katya i ve been worrying you 
darling forgive me 
it s madness 
katya i m a criminal 
and how could you be so distressed at such idiocy  
 oh i was sorry for you  
 for me 
for me 
how mad i am    
but why make you miserable 
it s awful to think that any outsider can shatter our happiness  
 it s humiliating too of course  
 oh then i ll keep him here all the summer and will overwhelm him with civility  said levin kissing her hands 
 you shall see 
tomorrow     oh yes we are going tomorrow  
chapter    next day before the ladies were up the wagonette and a trap for the shooting party were at the door and laska aware since early morning that they were going shooting after much whining and darting to and fro had sat herself down in the wagonette beside the coachman and disapproving of the delay was excitedly watching the door from which the sportsmen still did not come out 
the first to come out was vassenka veslovsky in new high boots that reached half way up his thick thighs in a green blouse with a new russian leather cartridge belt and in his scotch cap with ribbons with a brand new english gun without a sling 
laska flew up to him welcomed him and jumping up asked him in her own way whether the others were coming soon but getting no answer from him she returned to her post of observation and sank into repose again her head on one side and one ear pricked up to listen 
at last the door opened with a creak and stepan arkadyevitch s spot and tan pointer krak flew out running round and round and turning over in the air 
stepan arkadyevitch himself followed with a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth 
 good dog good dog krak  
he cried encouragingly to the dog who put his paws up on his chest catching at his game bag 
stepan arkadyevitch was dressed in rough leggings and spats in torn trousers and a short coat 
on his head there was a wreck of a hat of indefinite form but his gun of a new patent was a perfect gem and his game bag and cartridge belt though worn were of the very best quality 
vassenka veslovsky had had no notion before that it was truly chic  for a sportsman to be in tatters but to have his shooting outfit of the best quality 
he saw it now as he looked at stepan arkadyevitch radiant in his rags graceful well fed and joyous a typical russian nobleman 
and he made up his mind that next time he went shooting he would certainly adopt the same get up 
 well and what about our host  
he asked 
 a young wife  said stepan arkadyevitch smiling 
 yes and such a charming one  
 he came down dressed 
no doubt he s run up to her again  
stepan arkadyevitch guessed right 
levin had run up again to his wife to ask her once more if she forgave him for his idiocy yesterday and moreover to beg her for christ s sake to be more careful 
the great thing was for her to keep away from the children  they might any minute push against her 
then he had once more to hear her declare that she was not angry with him for going away for two days and to beg her to be sure to send him a note next morning by a servant on horseback to write him if it were but two words only to let him know that all was well with her 
kitty was distressed as she always was at parting for a couple of days from her husband but when she saw his eager figure looking big and strong in his shooting boots and his white blouse and a sort of sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her she forgot her own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure and said good bye to him cheerfully 
 pardon gentlemen  
he said running out onto the steps 
 have you put the lunch in 
why is the chestnut on the right 
well it doesn t matter 
laska down go and lie down  
 put it with the herd of oxen  he said to the herdsman who was waiting for him at the steps with some question 
 excuse me here comes another villain  
levin jumped out of the wagonette in which he had already taken his seat to meet the carpenter who came towards the steps with a rule in his hand 
 you didn t come to the counting house yesterday and now you re detaining me 
well what is it  
 would your honor let me make another turning 
it s only three steps to add 
and we make it just fit at the same time 
it will be much more convenient  
 you should have listened to me  levin answered with annoyance 
 i said put the lines and then fit in the steps 
now there s no setting it right 
do as i told you and make a new staircase  
the point was that in the lodge that was being built the carpenter had spoiled the staircase fitting it together without calculating the space it was to fill so that the steps were all sloping when it was put in place 
now the carpenter wanted keeping the same staircase to add three steps 
 it will be much better  
 but where s your staircase coming out with its three steps  
 why upon my word sir  the carpenter said with a contemptuous smile 
 it comes out right at the very spot 
it starts so to speak  he said with a persuasive gesture it comes down and comes down and comes out  
 but three steps will add to the length too   where is it to come out  
 why to be sure it ll start from the bottom and go up and go up and come out so  the carpenter said obstinately and convincingly 
 it ll reach the ceiling and the wall  
 upon my word 
why it ll go up and up and come out like this  
levin took out a ramrod and began sketching him the staircase in the dust 
 there do you see  
 as your honor likes  said the carpenter with a sudden gleam in his eyes obviously understanding the thing at last 
 it seems it ll be best to make a new one  
 well then do it as you re told  levin shouted seating himself in the wagonette 
 down 
hold the dogs philip  
levin felt now at leaving behind all his family and household cares such an eager sense of joy in life and expectation that he was not disposed to talk 
besides that he had that feeling of concentrated excitement that every sportsman experiences as he approaches the scene of action 
if he had anything on his mind at that moment it was only the doubt whether they would start anything in the kolpensky marsh whether laska would show to advantage in comparison with krak and whether he would shoot well that day himself 
not to disgrace himself before a new spectator  not to be outdone by oblonsky  that too was a thought that crossed his brain 
oblonsky was feeling the same and he too was not talkative 
vassenka veslovsky kept up alone a ceaseless flow of cheerful chatter 
as he listened to him now levin felt ashamed to think how unfair he had been to him the day before 
vassenka was really a nice fellow simple good hearted and very good humored 
if levin had met him before he was married he would have made friends with him 
levin rather disliked his holiday attitude to life and a sort of free and easy assumption of elegance 
it was as though he assumed a high degree of importance in himself that could not be disputed because he had long nails and a stylish cap and everything else to correspond but this could be forgiven for the sake of his good nature and good breeding 
levin liked him for his good education for speaking french and english with such an excellent accent and for being a man of his world 
vassenka was extremely delighted with the left horse a horse of the don steppes 
he kept praising him enthusiastically 
 how fine it must be galloping over the steppes on a steppe horse 
eh 
isn t it  
he said 
he had imagined riding on a steppe horse as something wild and romantic and it turned out nothing of the sort 
but his simplicity particularly in conjunction with his good looks his amiable smile and the grace of his movements was very attractive 
either because his nature was sympathetic to levin or because levin was trying to atone for his sins of the previous evening by seeing nothing but what was good in him anyway he liked his society 
after they had driven over two miles from home veslovsky all at once felt for a cigar and his pocketbook and did not know whether he had lost them or left them on the table 
in the pocketbook there were thirty seven pounds and so the matter could not be left in uncertainty 
 do you know what levin i ll gallop home on that left trace horse 
that will be splendid 
eh  
he said preparing to get out 
 no why should you  
answered levin calculating that vassenka could hardly weigh less than seventeen stone 
 i ll send the coachman  
the coachman rode back on the trace horse and levin himself drove the remaining pair 
chapter    well now what s our plan of campaign 
tell us all about it  said stepan arkadyevitch 
 our plan is this 
now we re driving to gvozdyov 
in gvozdyov there s a grouse marsh on this side and beyond gvozdyov come some magnificent snipe marshes where there are grouse too 
it s hot now and we ll get there  it s fifteen miles or so  towards evening and have some evening shooting we ll spend the night there and go on tomorrow to the bigger moors  
 and is there nothing on the way  
 yes but we ll reserve ourselves besides it s hot 
there are two nice little places but i doubt there being anything to shoot  
levin would himself have liked to go into these little places but they were near home he could shoot them over any time and they were only little places  there would hardly be room for three to shoot 
and so with some insincerity he said that he doubted there being anything to shoot 
when they reached a little marsh levin would have driven by but stepan arkadyevitch with the experienced eye of a sportsman at once detected reeds visible from the road 
 shan t we try that  
he said pointing to the little marsh 
 levin do please 
how delightful  
vassenka veslovsky began begging and levin could but consent 
before they had time to stop the dogs had flown one before the other into the marsh 
 krak 
laska     
the dogs came back 
 there won t be room for three 
i ll stay here  said levin hoping they would find nothing but peewits who had been startled by the dogs and turning over in their flight were plaintively wailing over the marsh 
 no 
come along levin let s go together  
veslovsky called 
 really there s not room 
laska back laska 
you won t want another dog will you  
levin remained with the wagonette and looked enviously at the sportsmen 
they walked right across the marsh 
except little birds and peewits of which vassenka killed one there was nothing in the marsh 
 come you see now that it was not that i grudged the marsh  said levin only it s wasting time  
 oh no it was jolly all the same 
did you see us  
said vassenka veslovsky clambering awkwardly into the wagonette with his gun and his peewit in his hands 
 how splendidly i shot this bird 
didn t i 
well shall we soon be getting to the real place  
the horses started off suddenly levin knocked his head against the stock of someone s gun and there was the report of a shot 
the gun did actually go off first but that was how it seemed to levin 
it appeared that vassenka veslovsky had pulled only one trigger and had left the other hammer still cocked 
the charge flew into the ground without doing harm to anyone 
stepan arkadyevitch shook his head and laughed reprovingly at veslovsky 
but levin had not the heart to reprove him 
in the first place any reproach would have seemed to be called forth by the danger he had incurred and the bump that had come up on levin s forehead 
and besides veslovsky was at first so naïvely distressed and then laughed so good humoredly and infectiously at their general dismay that one could not but laugh with him 
when they reached the second marsh which was fairly large and would inevitably take some time to shoot over levin tried to persuade them to pass it by 
but veslovsky again overpersuaded him 
again as the marsh was narrow levin like a good host remained with the carriage 
krak made straight for some clumps of sedge 
vassenka veslovsky was the first to run after the dog 
before stepan arkadyevitch had time to come up a grouse flew out 
veslovsky missed it and it flew into an unmown meadow 
this grouse was left for veslovsky to follow up 
krak found it again and pointed and veslovsky shot it and went back to the carriage 
 now you go and i ll stay with the horses  he said 
levin had begun to feel the pangs of a sportsman s envy 
he handed the reins to veslovsky and walked into the marsh 
laska who had been plaintively whining and fretting against the injustice of her treatment flew straight ahead to a hopeful place that levin knew well and that krak had not yet come upon 
 why don t you stop her  
shouted stepan arkadyevitch 
 she won t scare them  answered levin sympathizing with his bitch s pleasure and hurrying after her 
as she came nearer and nearer to the familiar breeding places there was more and more earnestness in laska s exploration 
a little marsh bird did not divert her attention for more than an instant 
she made one circuit round the clump of reeds was beginning a second and suddenly quivered with excitement and became motionless 
 come come stiva  
shouted levin feeling his heart beginning to beat more violently and all of a sudden as though some sort of shutter had been drawn back from his straining ears all sounds confused but loud began to beat on his hearing losing all sense of distance 
he heard the steps of stepan arkadyevitch mistaking them for the tramp of the horses in the distance he heard the brittle sound of the twigs on which he had trodden taking this sound for the flying of a grouse 
he heard too not far behind him a splashing in the water which he could not explain to himself 
picking his steps he moved up to the dog 
 fetch it  
not a grouse but a snipe flew up from beside the dog 
levin had lifted his gun but at the very instant when he was taking aim the sound of splashing grew louder came closer and was joined with the sound of veslovsky s voice shouting something with strange loudness 
levin saw he had his gun pointed behind the snipe but still he fired 
when he had made sure he had missed levin looked round and saw the horses and the wagonette not on the road but in the marsh 
veslovsky eager to see the shooting had driven into the marsh and got the horses stuck in the mud 
 damn the fellow  
levin said to himself as he went back to the carriage that had sunk in the mire 
 what did you drive in for  
he said to him dryly and calling the coachman he began pulling the horses out 
levin was vexed both at being hindered from shooting and at his horses getting stuck in the mud and still more at the fact that neither stepan arkadyevitch nor veslovsky helped him and the coachman to unharness the horses and get them out since neither of them had the slightest notion of harnessing 
without vouchsafing a syllable in reply to vassenka s protestations that it had been quite dry there levin worked in silence with the coachman at extricating the horses 
but then as he got warm at the work and saw how assiduously veslovsky was tugging at the wagonette by one of the mud guards so that he broke it indeed levin blamed himself for having under the influence of yesterday s feelings been too cold to veslovsky and tried to be particularly genial so as to smooth over his chilliness 
when everything had been put right and the carriage had been brought back to the road levin had the lunch served  
bon appétit  bonne conscience 
ce poulet va tomber jusqu au fond de mes bottes  vassenka who had recovered his spirits quoted the french saying as he finished his second chicken 
 well now our troubles are over now everything s going to go well 
only to atone for my sins i m bound to sit on the box 
that s so 
eh 
no no 
i ll be your automedon 
you shall see how i ll get you along  he answered not letting go the rein when levin begged him to let the coachman drive 
 no i must atone for my sins and i m very comfortable on the box  
and he drove 
levin was a little afraid he would exhaust the horses especially the chestnut whom he did not know how to hold in but unconsciously he fell under the influence of his gaiety and listened to the songs he sang all the way on the box or the descriptions and representations he gave of driving in the english fashion four in hand and it was in the very best of spirits that after lunch they drove to the gvozdyov marsh 
chapter    vassenka drove the horses so smartly that they reached the marsh too early while it was still hot 
as they drew near this more important marsh the chief aim of their expedition levin could not help considering how he could get rid of vassenka and be free in his movements 
stepan arkadyevitch evidently had the same desire and on his face levin saw the look of anxiety always present in a true sportsman when beginning shooting together with a certain good humored slyness peculiar to him 
 how shall we go 
it s a splendid marsh i see and there are hawks  said stepan arkadyevitch pointing to two great birds hovering over the reeds 
 where there are hawks there is sure to be game  
 now gentlemen  said levin pulling up his boots and examining the lock of his gun with rather a gloomy expression do you see those reeds  
he pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge half mown wet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river 
 the marsh begins here straight in front of us do you see  where it is greener 
from here it runs to the right where the horses are there are breeding places there and grouse and all round those reeds as far as that alder and right up to the mill 
over there do you see where the pools are 
that s the best place 
there i once shot seventeen snipe 
we ll separate with the dogs and go in different directions and then meet over there at the mill  
 well which shall go to left and which to right  
asked stepan arkadyevitch 
 it s wider to the right you two go that way and i ll take the left  he said with apparent carelessness 
 capital 
we ll make the bigger bag 
yes come along come along  
vassenka exclaimed 
levin could do nothing but agree and they divided 
as soon as they entered the marsh the two dogs began hunting about together and made towards the green slime covered pool 
levin knew laska s method wary and indefinite he knew the place too and expected a whole covey of snipe 
 veslovsky beside me walk beside me  
he said in a faint voice to his companion splashing in the water behind him 
levin could not help feeling an interest in the direction his gun was pointed after that casual shot near the kolpensky marsh 
 oh i won t get in your way don t trouble about me  
but levin could not help troubling and recalled kitty s words at parting mind you don t shoot one another  
the dogs came nearer and nearer passed each other each pursuing its own scent 
the expectation of snipe was so intense that to levin the squelching sound of his own heel as he drew it up out of the mire seemed to be the call of a snipe and he clutched and pressed the lock of his gun 
 bang 
bang  
sounded almost in his ear 
vassenka had fired at a flock of ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying at that moment towards the sportsmen far out of range 
before levin had time to look round there was the whir of one snipe another a third and some eight more rose one after another 
stepan arkadyevitch hit one at the very moment when it was beginning its zigzag movements and the snipe fell in a heap into the mud 
oblonsky aimed deliberately at another still flying low in the reeds and together with the report of the shot that snipe too fell and it could be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut its unhurt wing showing white beneath 
levin was not so lucky he aimed at his first bird too low and missed he aimed at it again just as it was rising but at that instant another snipe flew up at his very feet distracting him so that he missed again 
while they were loading their guns another snipe rose and veslovsky who had had time to load again sent two charges of small shot into the water 
stepan arkadyevitch picked up his snipe and with sparkling eyes looked at levin 
 well now let us separate  said stepan arkadyevitch and limping on his left foot holding his gun in readiness and whistling to his dog he walked off in one direction 
levin and veslovsky walked in the other 
it always happened with levin that when his first shots were a failure he got hot and out of temper and shot badly the whole day 
so it was that day 
the snipe showed themselves in numbers 
they kept flying up from just under the dogs from under the sportsmen s legs and levin might have retrieved his ill luck 
but the more he shot the more he felt disgraced in the eyes of veslovsky who kept popping away merrily and indiscriminately killing nothing and not in the slightest abashed by his ill success 
levin in feverish haste could not restrain himself got more and more out of temper and ended by shooting almost without a hope of hitting 
laska indeed seemed to understand this 
she began looking more languidly and gazed back at the sportsmen as it were with perplexity or reproach in her eyes 
shots followed shots in rapid succession 
the smoke of the powder hung about the sportsmen while in the great roomy net of the game bag there were only three light little snipe 
and of these one had been killed by veslovsky alone and one by both of them together 
meanwhile from the other side of the marsh came the sound of stepan arkadyevitch s shots not frequent but as levin fancied well directed for almost after each they heard krak krak  apporte  
this excited levin still more 
the snipe were floating continually in the air over the reeds 
their whirring wings close to the earth and their harsh cries high in the air could be heard on all sides the snipe that had risen first and flown up into the air settled again before the sportsmen 
instead of two hawks there were now dozens of them hovering with shrill cries over the marsh 
after walking through the larger half of the marsh levin and veslovsky reached the place where the peasants mowing grass was divided into long strips reaching to the reeds marked off in one place by the trampled grass in another by a path mown through it 
half of these strips had already been mown 
though there was not so much hope of finding birds in the uncut part as the cut part levin had promised stepan arkadyevitch to meet him and so he walked on with his companion through the cut and uncut patches 
 hi sportsmen  
shouted one of a group of peasants sitting on an unharnessed cart come and have some lunch with us 
have a drop of wine  
levin looked round 
 come along it s all right  
shouted a good humored looking bearded peasant with a red face showing his white teeth in a grin and holding up a greenish bottle that flashed in the sunlight  
qu est ce qu ils disent  
asked veslovsky 
 they invite you to have some vodka 
most likely they ve been dividing the meadow into lots 
i should have some  said levin not without some guile hoping veslovsky would be tempted by the vodka and would go away to them 
 why do they offer it  
 oh they re merry making 
really you should join them 
you would be interested  
 allons c est curieux  
 you go you go you ll find the way to the mill  
cried levin and looking round he perceived with satisfaction that veslovsky bent and stumbling with weariness holding his gun out at arm s length was making his way out of the marsh towards the peasants 
 you come too  
the peasants shouted to levin 
 never fear 
you taste our cake  
levin felt a strong inclination to drink a little vodka and to eat some bread 
he was exhausted and felt it a great effort to drag his staggering legs out of the mire and for a minute he hesitated 
but laska was setting 
and immediately all his weariness vanished and he walked lightly through the swamp towards the dog 
a snipe flew up at his feet he fired and killed it 
laska still pointed    fetch it  
another bird flew up close to the dog 
levin fired 
but it was an unlucky day for him he missed it and when he went to look for the one he had shot he could not find that either 
he wandered all about the reeds but laska did not believe he had shot it and when he sent her to find it she pretended to hunt for it but did not really 
and in the absence of vassenka on whom levin threw the blame of his failure things went no better 
there were plenty of snipe still but levin made one miss after another 
the slanting rays of the sun were still hot his clothes soaked through with perspiration stuck to his body his left boot full of water weighed heavily on his leg and squeaked at every step the sweat ran in drops down his powder grimed face his mouth was full of the bitter taste his nose of the smell of powder and stagnant water his ears were ringing with the incessant whir of the snipe he could not touch the stock of his gun it was so hot his heart beat with short rapid throbs his hands shook with excitement and his weary legs stumbled and staggered over the hillocks and in the swamp but still he walked on and still he shot 
at last after a disgraceful miss he flung his gun and his hat on the ground 
 no i must control myself  he said to himself 
picking up his gun and his hat he called laska and went out of the swamp 
when he got on to dry ground he sat down pulled off his boot and emptied it then walked to the marsh drank some stagnant tasting water moistened his burning hot gun and washed his face and hands 
feeling refreshed he went back to the spot where a snipe had settled firmly resolved to keep cool 
he tried to be calm but it was the same again 
his finger pressed the cock before he had taken a good aim at the bird 
it got worse and worse 
he had only five birds in his game bag when he walked out of the marsh towards the alders where he was to rejoin stepan arkadyevitch 
before he caught sight of stepan arkadyevitch he saw his dog 
krak darted out from behind the twisted root of an alder black all over with the stinking mire of the marsh and with the air of a conqueror sniffed at laska 
behind krak there came into view in the shade of the alder tree the shapely figure of stepan arkadyevitch 
he came to meet him red and perspiring with unbuttoned neckband still limping in the same way 
 well 
you have been popping away  
he said smiling good humoredly 
 how have you got on  
queried levin 
but there was no need to ask for he had already seen the full game bag 
 oh pretty fair  
he had fourteen birds 
 a splendid marsh 
i ve no doubt veslovsky got in your way 
it s awkward too shooting with one dog  said stepan arkadyevitch to soften his triumph 
chapter    when levin and stepan arkadyevitch reached the peasant s hut where levin always used to stay veslovsky was already there 
he was sitting in the middle of the hut clinging with both hands to the bench from which he was being pulled by a soldier the brother of the peasant s wife who was helping him off with his miry boots 
veslovsky was laughing his infectious good humored laugh 
 i ve only just come 
ils ont été charmants 
just fancy they gave me drink fed me 
such bread it was exquisite 
delicieux 
and the vodka i never tasted any better 
and they would not take a penny for anything 
and they kept saying excuse our homely ways   
 what should they take anything for 
they were entertaining you to be sure 
do you suppose they keep vodka for sale  
said the soldier succeeding at last in pulling the soaked boot off the blackened stocking 
in spite of the dirtiness of the hut which was all muddied by their boots and the filthy dogs licking themselves clean and the smell of marsh mud and powder that filled the room and the absence of knives and forks the party drank their tea and ate their supper with a relish only known to sportsmen 
washed and clean they went into a hay barn swept ready for them where the coachman had been making up beds for the gentlemen 
though it was dusk not one of them wanted to go to sleep 
after wavering among reminiscences and anecdotes of guns of dogs and of former shooting parties the conversation rested on a topic that interested all of them 
after vassenka had several times over expressed his appreciation of this delightful sleeping place among the fragrant hay this delightful broken cart he supposed it to be broken because the shafts had been taken out  of the good nature of the peasants that had treated him to vodka of the dogs who lay at the feet of their respective masters oblonsky began telling them of a delightful shooting party at malthus s where he had stayed the previous summer 
malthus was a well known capitalist who had made his money by speculation in railway shares 
stepan arkadyevitch described what grouse moors this malthus had bought in the tver province and how they were preserved and of the carriages and dogcarts in which the shooting party had been driven and the luncheon pavilion that had been rigged up at the marsh 
 i don t understand you  said levin sitting up in the hay how is it such people don t disgust you 
i can understand a lunch with lafitte is all very pleasant but don t you dislike just that very sumptuousness 
all these people just like our spirit monopolists in old days get their money in a way that gains them the contempt of everyone 
they don t care for their contempt and then they use their dishonest gains to buy off the contempt they have deserved  
 perfectly true  
chimed in vassenka veslovsky 
 perfectly 
oblonsky of course goes out of  bonhomie  but other people say well oblonsky stays with them      
 not a bit of it  
levin could hear that oblonsky was smiling as he spoke 
 i simply don t consider him more dishonest than any other wealthy merchant or nobleman 
they ve all made their money alike  by their work and their intelligence  
 oh by what work 
do you call it work to get hold of concessions and speculate with them  
 of course it s work 
work in this sense that if it were not for him and others like him there would have been no railways  
 but that s not work like the work of a peasant or a learned profession  
 granted but it s work in the sense that his activity produces a result  the railways 
but of course you think the railways useless  
 no that s another question i am prepared to admit that they re useful 
but all profit that is out of proportion to the labor expended is dishonest  
 but who is to define what is proportionate  
 making profit by dishonest means by trickery  said levin conscious that he could not draw a distinct line between honesty and dishonesty 
 such as banking for instance  he went on 
 it s an evil  the amassing of huge fortunes without labor just the same thing as with the spirit monopolies it s only the form that s changed 
le roi est mort vive le roi 
no sooner were the spirit monopolies abolished than the railways came up and banking companies that too is profit without work  
 yes that may all be very true and clever    
lie down krak  
stepan arkadyevitch called to his dog who was scratching and turning over all the hay 
he was obviously convinced of the correctness of his position and so talked serenely and without haste 
 but you have not drawn the line between honest and dishonest work 
that i receive a bigger salary than my chief clerk though he knows more about the work than i do  that s dishonest i suppose  
 i can t say  
 well but i can tell you your receiving some five thousand let s say for your work on the land while our host the peasant here however hard he works can never get more than fifty roubles is just as dishonest as my earning more than my chief clerk and malthus getting more than a station master 
no quite the contrary i see that society takes up a sort of antagonistic attitude to these people which is utterly baseless and i fancy there s envy at the bottom of it      no that s unfair  said veslovsky how could envy come in 
there is something not nice about that sort of business  
 you say  levin went on that it s unjust for me to receive five thousand while the peasant has fifty that s true 
it is unfair and i feel it but     it really is 
why is it we spend our time riding drinking shooting doing nothing while they are forever at work  
said vassenka veslovsky obviously for the first time in his life reflecting on the question and consequently considering it with perfect sincerity 
 yes you feel it but you don t give him your property  said stepan arkadyevitch intentionally as it seemed provoking levin 
there had arisen of late something like a secret antagonism between the two brothers in law as though since they had married sisters a kind of rivalry had sprung up between them as to which was ordering his life best and now this hostility showed itself in the conversation as it began to take a personal note 
 i don t give it away because no one demands that from me and if i wanted to i could not give it away  answered levin and have no one to give it to  
 give it to this peasant he would not refuse it  
 yes but how am i to give it up 
am i to go to him and make a deed of conveyance  
 i don t know but if you are convinced that you have no right     i m not at all convinced 
on the contrary i feel i have no right to give it up that i have duties both to the land and to my family  
 no excuse me but if you consider this inequality is unjust why is it you don t act accordingly     
 well i do act negatively on that idea so far as not trying to increase the difference of position existing between him and me  
 no excuse me that s a paradox  
 yes there s something of a sophistry about that  veslovsky agreed 
 ah 
our host so you re not asleep yet  
he said to the peasant who came into the barn opening the creaking door 
 how is it you re not asleep  
 no how s one to sleep 
i thought our gentlemen would be asleep but i heard them chattering 
i want to get a hook from here 
she won t bite  
he added stepping cautiously with his bare feet 
 and where are you going to sleep  
 we are going out for the night with the beasts  
 ah what a night  
said veslovsky looking out at the edge of the hut and the unharnessed wagonette that could be seen in the faint light of the evening glow in the great frame of the open doors 
 but listen there are women s voices singing and on my word not badly too 
who s that singing my friend  
 that s the maids from hard by here  
 let s go let s have a walk 
we shan t go to sleep you know 
oblonsky come along  
 if one could only do both lie here and go  answered oblonsky stretching 
 it s capital lying here  
 well i shall go by myself  said veslovsky getting up eagerly and putting on his shoes and stockings 
 good bye gentlemen 
if it s fun i ll fetch you 
you ve treated me to some good sport and i won t forget you  
 he really is a capital fellow isn t he  
said stepan arkadyevitch when veslovsky had gone out and the peasant had closed the door after him 
 yes capital  answered levin still thinking of the subject of their conversation just before 
it seemed to him that he had clearly expressed his thoughts and feelings to the best of his capacity and yet both of them straightforward men and not fools had said with one voice that he was comforting himself with sophistries 
this disconcerted him 
 it s just this my dear boy 
one must do one of two things either admit that the existing order of society is just and then stick up for one s rights in it or acknowledge that you are enjoying unjust privileges as i do and then enjoy them and be satisfied  
 no if it were unjust you could not enjoy these advantages and be satisfied  at least i could not 
the great thing for me is to feel that i m not to blame  
 what do you say why not go after all  
said stepan arkadyevitch evidently weary of the strain of thought 
 we shan t go to sleep you know 
come let s go  
levin did not answer 
what they had said in the conversation that he acted justly only in a negative sense absorbed his thoughts 
 can it be that it s only possible to be just negatively  
he was asking himself 
 how strong the smell of the fresh hay is though  said stepan arkadyevitch getting up 
 there s not a chance of sleeping 
vassenka has been getting up some fun there 
do you hear the laughing and his voice 
hadn t we better go 
come along  
 no i m not coming  answered levin 
 surely that s not a matter of principle too  said stepan arkadyevitch smiling as he felt about in the dark for his cap 
 it s not a matter of principle but why should i go  
 but do you know you are preparing trouble for yourself  said stepan arkadyevitch finding his cap and getting up 
 how so  
 do you suppose i don t see the line you ve taken up with your wife 
i heard how it s a question of the greatest consequence whether or not you re to be away for a couple of days shooting 
that s all very well as an idyllic episode but for your whole life that won t answer 
a man must be independent he has his masculine interests 
a man has to be manly  said oblonsky opening the door 
 in what way 
to go running after servant girls  
said levin 
 why not if it amuses him 
ça ne tire pas a consequence 
it won t do my wife any harm and it ll amuse me 
the great thing is to respect the sanctity of the home 
there should be nothing in the home 
but don t tie your own hands  
 perhaps so  said levin dryly and he turned on his side 
 tomorrow early i want to go shooting and i won t wake anyone and shall set off at daybreak  
 messieurs venez vite 
they heard the voice of veslovsky coming back  
charmante 
i ve made such a discovery 
charmante 
a perfect gretchen and i ve already made friends with her 
really exceedingly pretty  he declared in a tone of approval as though she had been made pretty entirely on his account and he was expressing his satisfaction with the entertainment that had been provided for him 
levin pretended to be asleep while oblonsky putting on his slippers and lighting a cigar walked out of the barn and soon their voices were lost 
for a long while levin could not get to sleep 
he heard the horses munching hay then he heard the peasant and his elder boy getting ready for the night and going off for the night watch with the beasts then he heard the soldier arranging his bed on the other side of the barn with his nephew the younger son of their peasant host 
he heard the boy in his shrill little voice telling his uncle what he thought about the dogs who seemed to him huge and terrible creatures and asking what the dogs were going to hunt next day and the soldier in a husky sleepy voice telling him the sportsmen were going in the morning to the marsh and would shoot with their guns and then to check the boy s questions he said go to sleep vaska go to sleep or you ll catch it  and soon after he began snoring himself and everything was still 
he could only hear the snort of the horses and the guttural cry of a snipe 
 is it really only negative  
he repeated to himself 
 well what of it 
it s not my fault  
and he began thinking about the next day 
 tomorrow i ll go out early and i ll make a point of keeping cool 
there are lots of snipe and there are grouse too 
when i come back there ll be the note from kitty 
yes stiva may be right i m not manly with her i m tied to her apron strings    well it can t be helped 
negative again      half asleep he heard the laughter and mirthful talk of veslovsky and stepan arkadyevitch 
for an instant he opened his eyes the moon was up and in the open doorway brightly lighted up by the moonlight they were standing talking 
stepan arkadyevitch was saying something of the freshness of one girl comparing her to a freshly peeled nut and veslovsky with his infectious laugh was repeating some words probably said to him by a peasant ah you do your best to get round her  
levin half asleep said  gentlemen tomorrow before daylight  
and fell asleep 
chapter    waking up at earliest dawn levin tried to wake his companions 
vassenka lying on his stomach with one leg in a stocking thrust out was sleeping so soundly that he could elicit no response 
oblonsky half asleep declined to get up so early 
even laska who was asleep curled up in the hay got up unwillingly and lazily stretched out and straightened her hind legs one after the other 
getting on his boots and stockings taking his gun and carefully opening the creaking door of the barn levin went out into the road 
the coachmen were sleeping in their carriages the horses were dozing 
only one was lazily eating oats dipping its nose into the manger 
it was still gray out of doors 
 why are you up so early my dear  
the old woman their hostess said coming out of the hut and addressing him affectionately as an old friend 
 going shooting granny 
do i go this way to the marsh  
 straight out at the back by our threshing floor my dear and hemp patches there s a little footpath  
stepping carefully with her sunburnt bare feet the old woman conducted levin and moved back the fence for him by the threshing floor 
 straight on and you ll come to the marsh 
our lads drove the cattle there yesterday evening  
laska ran eagerly forward along the little path 
levin followed her with a light rapid step continually looking at the sky 
he hoped the sun would not be up before he reached the marsh 
but the sun did not delay 
the moon which had been bright when he went out by now shone only like a crescent of quicksilver 
the pink flush of dawn which one could not help seeing before now had to be sought to be discerned at all 
what were before undefined vague blurs in the distant countryside could now be distinctly seen 
they were sheaves of rye 
the dew not visible till the sun was up wetted levin s legs and his blouse above his belt in the high growing fragrant hemp patch from which the pollen had already fallen out 
in the transparent stillness of morning the smallest sounds were audible 
a bee flew by levin s ear with the whizzing sound of a bullet 
he looked carefully and saw a second and a third 
they were all flying from the beehives behind the hedge and they disappeared over the hemp patch in the direction of the marsh 
the path led straight to the marsh 
the marsh could be recognized by the mist which rose from it thicker in one place and thinner in another so that the reeds and willow bushes swayed like islands in this mist 
at the edge of the marsh and the road peasant boys and men who had been herding for the night were lying and in the dawn all were asleep under their coats 
not far from them were three hobbled horses 
one of them clanked a chain 
laska walked beside her master pressing a little forward and looking round 
passing the sleeping peasants and reaching the first reeds levin examined his pistols and let his dog off 
one of the horses a sleek dark brown three year old seeing the dog started away switched its tail and snorted 
the other horses too were frightened and splashing through the water with their hobbled legs and drawing their hoofs out of the thick mud with a squelching sound they bounded out of the marsh 
laska stopped looking ironically at the horses and inquiringly at levin 
levin patted laska and whistled as a sign that she might begin 
laska ran joyfully and anxiously through the slush that swayed under her 
running into the marsh among the familiar scents of roots marsh plants and slime and the extraneous smell of horse dung laska detected at once a smell that pervaded the whole marsh the scent of that strong smelling bird that always excited her more than any other 
here and there among the moss and marsh plants this scent was very strong but it was impossible to determine in which direction it grew stronger or fainter 
to find the direction she had to go farther away from the wind 
not feeling the motion of her legs laska bounded with a stiff gallop so that at each bound she could stop short to the right away from the wind that blew from the east before sunrise and turned facing the wind 
sniffing in the air with dilated nostrils she felt at once that not their tracks only but they themselves were here before her and not one but many 
laska slackened her speed 
they were here but where precisely she could not yet determine 
to find the very spot she began to make a circle when suddenly her master s voice drew her off 
 laska 
here  
he asked pointing her to a different direction 
she stopped asking him if she had better not go on doing as she had begun 
but he repeated his command in an angry voice pointing to a spot covered with water where there could not be anything 
she obeyed him pretending she was looking so as to please him went round it and went back to her former position and was at once aware of the scent again 
now when he was not hindering her she knew what to do and without looking at what was under her feet and to her vexation stumbling over a high stump into the water but righting herself with her strong supple legs she began making the circle which was to make all clear to her 
the scent of them reached her stronger and stronger and more and more defined and all at once it became perfectly clear to her that one of them was here behind this tuft of reeds five paces in front of her she stopped and her whole body was still and rigid 
on her short legs she could see nothing in front of her but by the scent she knew it was sitting not more than five paces off 
she stood still feeling more and more conscious of it and enjoying it in anticipation 
her tail was stretched straight and tense and only wagging at the extreme end 
her mouth was slightly open her ears raised 
one ear had been turned wrong side out as she ran up and she breathed heavily but warily and still more warily looked round but more with her eyes than her head to her master 
he was coming along with the face she knew so well though the eyes were always terrible to her 
he stumbled over the stump as he came and moved as she thought extraordinarily slowly 
she thought he came slowly but he was running 
noticing laska s special attitude as she crouched on the ground as it were scratching big prints with her hind paws and with her mouth slightly open levin knew she was pointing at grouse and with an inward prayer for luck especially with the first bird he ran up to her 
coming quite close up to her he could from his height look beyond her and he saw with his eyes what she was seeing with her nose 
in a space between two little thickets at a couple of yards distance he could see a grouse 
turning its head it was listening 
then lightly preening and folding its wings it disappeared round a corner with a clumsy wag of its tail 
 fetch it fetch it  
shouted levin giving laska a shove from behind 
 but i can t go  thought laska 
 where am i to go 
from here i feel them but if i move forward i shall know nothing of where they are or who they are  
but then he shoved her with his knee and in an excited whisper said fetch it laska  
 well if that s what he wishes i ll do it but i can t answer for myself now  she thought and darted forward as fast as her legs would carry her between the thick bushes 
she scented nothing now she could only see and hear without understanding anything 
ten paces from her former place a grouse rose with a guttural cry and the peculiar round sound of its wings 
and immediately after the shot it splashed heavily with its white breast on the wet mire 
another bird did not linger but rose behind levin without the dog 
when levin turned towards it it was already some way off 
but his shot caught it 
flying twenty paces further the second grouse rose upwards and whirling round like a ball dropped heavily on a dry place 
 come this is going to be some good  
thought levin packing the warm and fat grouse into his game bag 
 eh laska will it be good  
when levin after loading his gun moved on the sun had fully risen though unseen behind the storm clouds 
the moon had lost all of its luster and was like a white cloud in the sky 
not a single star could be seen 
the sedge silvery with dew before now shone like gold 
the stagnant pools were all like amber 
the blue of the grass had changed to yellow green 
the marsh birds twittered and swarmed about the brook and upon the bushes that glittered with dew and cast long shadows 
a hawk woke up and settled on a haycock turning its head from side to side and looking discontentedly at the marsh 
crows were flying about the field and a bare legged boy was driving the horses to an old man who had got up from under his long coat and was combing his hair 
the smoke from the gun was white as milk over the green of the grass 
one of the boys ran up to levin 
 uncle there were ducks here yesterday  
he shouted to him and he walked a little way off behind him 
and levin was doubly pleased in sight of the boy who expressed his approval at killing three snipe one after another straight off 
chapter    the sportsman s saying that if the first beast or the first bird is not missed the day will be lucky turned out correct 
at ten o clock levin weary hungry and happy after a tramp of twenty miles returned to his night s lodging with nineteen head of fine game and one duck which he tied to his belt as it would not go into the game bag 
his companions had long been awake and had had time to get hungry and have breakfast 
 wait a bit wait a bit i know there are nineteen  said levin counting a second time over the grouse and snipe that looked so much less important now bent and dry and bloodstained with heads crooked aside than they did when they were flying 
the number was verified and stepan arkadyevitch s envy pleased levin 
he was pleased too on returning to find the man sent by kitty with a note was already there 
 i am perfectly well and happy 
if you were uneasy about me you can feel easier than ever 
i ve a new bodyguard marya vlasyevna    this was the midwife a new and important personage in levin s domestic life 
 she has come to have a look at me 
she found me perfectly well and we have kept her till you are back 
all are happy and well and please don t be in a hurry to come back but if the sport is good stay another day  
these two pleasures his lucky shooting and the letter from his wife were so great that two slightly disagreeable incidents passed lightly over levin 
one was that the chestnut trace horse who had been unmistakably overworked on the previous day was off his feed and out of sorts 
the coachman said he was overdriven yesterday konstantin dmitrievitch 
yes indeed 
driven ten miles with no sense  
the other unpleasant incident which for the first minute destroyed his good humor though later he laughed at it a great deal was to find that of all the provisions kitty had provided in such abundance that one would have thought there was enough for a week nothing was left 
on his way back tired and hungry from shooting levin had so distinct a vision of meat pies that as he approached the hut he seemed to smell and taste them as laska had smelt the game and he immediately told philip to give him some 
it appeared that there were no pies left nor even any chicken 
 well this fellow s appetite  
said stepan arkadyevitch laughing and pointing at vassenka veslovsky 
 i never suffer from loss of appetite but he s really marvelous     
 well it can t be helped  said levin looking gloomily at veslovsky 
 well philip give me some beef then  
 the beef s been eaten and the bones given to the dogs  answered philip 
levin was so hurt that he said in a tone of vexation you might have left me something  
and he felt ready to cry 
 then put away the game  he said in a shaking voice to philip trying not to look at vassenka and cover them with some nettles 
and you might at least ask for some milk for me  
but when he had drunk some milk he felt ashamed immediately at having shown his annoyance to a stranger and he began to laugh at his hungry mortification 
in the evening they went shooting again and veslovsky had several successful shots and in the night they drove home 
their homeward journey was as lively as their drive out had been 
veslovsky sang songs and related with enjoyment his adventures with the peasants who had regaled him with vodka and said to him excuse our homely ways  and his night s adventures with kiss in the ring and the servant girl and the peasant who had asked him was he married and on learning that he was not said to him well mind you don t run after other men s wives  you d better get one of your own  
these words had particularly amused veslovsky 
 altogether i ve enjoyed our outing awfully 
and you levin  
 i have very much  levin said quite sincerely 
it was particularly delightful to him to have got rid of the hostility he had been feeling towards vassenka veslovsky at home and to feel instead the most friendly disposition to him 
chapter    next day at ten o clock levin who had already gone his rounds knocked at the room where vassenka had been put for the night  
entrez 
veslovsky called to him 
 excuse me i ve only just finished my ablutions  he said smiling standing before him in his underclothes only 
 don t mind me please  
levin sat down in the window 
 have you slept well  
 like the dead 
what sort of day is it for shooting  
 what will you take tea or coffee  
 neither 
i ll wait till lunch 
i m really ashamed 
i suppose the ladies are down 
a walk now would be capital 
you show me your horses  
after walking about the garden visiting the stable and even doing some gymnastic exercises together on the parallel bars levin returned to the house with his guest and went with him into the drawing room 
 we had splendid shooting and so many delightful experiences  
said veslovsky going up to kitty who was sitting at the samovar 
 what a pity ladies are cut off from these delights  
 well i suppose he must say something to the lady of the house  levin said to himself 
again he fancied something in the smile in the all conquering air with which their guest addressed kitty    
the princess sitting on the other side of the table with marya vlasyevna and stepan arkadyevitch called levin to her side and began to talk to him about moving to moscow for kitty s confinement and getting ready rooms for them 
just as levin had disliked all the trivial preparations for his wedding as derogatory to the grandeur of the event now he felt still more offensive the preparations for the approaching birth the date of which they reckoned it seemed on their fingers 
he tried to turn a deaf ear to these discussions of the best patterns of long clothes for the coming baby tried to turn away and avoid seeing the mysterious endless strips of knitting the triangles of linen and so on to which dolly attached special importance 
the birth of a son he was certain it would be a son which was promised him but which he still could not believe in  so marvelous it seemed  presented itself to his mind on one hand as a happiness so immense and therefore so incredible on the other as an event so mysterious that this assumption of a definite knowledge of what would be and consequent preparation for it as for something ordinary that did happen to people jarred on him as confusing and humiliating 
but the princess did not understand his feelings and put down his reluctance to think and talk about it to carelessness and indifference and so she gave him no peace 
she had commissioned stepan arkadyevitch to look at a flat and now she called levin up 
 i know nothing about it princess 
do as you think fit  he said 
 you must decide when you will move  
 i really don t know 
i know millions of children are born away from moscow and doctors   why     but if so     oh no as kitty wishes  
 we can t talk to kitty about it 
do you want me to frighten her 
why this spring natalia golitzina died from having an ignorant doctor  
 i will do just what you say  he said gloomily 
the princess began talking to him but he did not hear her 
though the conversation with the princess had indeed jarred upon him he was gloomy not on account of that conversation but from what he saw at the samovar 
 no it s impossible  he thought glancing now and then at vassenka bending over kitty telling her something with his charming smile and at her flushed and disturbed 
there was something not nice in vassenka s attitude in his eyes in his smile 
levin even saw something not nice in kitty s attitude and look 
and again the light died away in his eyes 
again as before all of a sudden without the slightest transition he felt cast down from a pinnacle of happiness peace and dignity into an abyss of despair rage and humiliation 
again everything and everyone had become hateful to him 
 you do just as you think best princess  he said again looking round 
 heavy is the cap of monomach  stepan arkadyevitch said playfully hinting evidently not simply at the princess s conversation but at the cause of levin s agitation which he had noticed 
 how late you are today dolly  
everyone got up to greet darya alexandrovna 
vassenka only rose for an instant and with the lack of courtesy to ladies characteristic of the modern young man he scarcely bowed and resumed his conversation again laughing at something 
 i ve been worried about masha 
she did not sleep well and is dreadfully tiresome today  said dolly 
the conversation vassenka had started with kitty was running on the same lines as on the previous evening discussing anna and whether love is to be put higher than worldly considerations 
kitty disliked the conversation and she was disturbed both by the subject and the tone in which it was conducted and also by the knowledge of the effect it would have on her husband 
but she was too simple and innocent to know how to cut short this conversation or even to conceal the superficial pleasure afforded her by the young man s very obvious admiration 
she wanted to stop it but she did not know what to do 
whatever she did she knew would be observed by her husband and the worst interpretation put on it 
and in fact when she asked dolly what was wrong with masha and vassenka waiting till this uninteresting conversation was over began to gaze indifferently at dolly the question struck levin as an unnatural and disgusting piece of hypocrisy 
 what do you say shall we go and look for mushrooms today  
said dolly 
 by all means please and i shall come too  said kitty and she blushed 
she wanted from politeness to ask vassenka whether he would come and she did not ask him 
 where are you going kostya  
she asked her husband with a guilty face as he passed by her with a resolute step 
this guilty air confirmed all his suspicions 
 the mechanician came when i was away i haven t seen him yet  he said not looking at her 
he went downstairs but before he had time to leave his study he heard his wife s familiar footsteps running with reckless speed to him 
 what do you want  
he said to her shortly 
 we are busy  
 i beg your pardon  she said to the german mechanician i want a few words with my husband  
the german would have left the room but levin said to him  don t disturb yourself  
 the train is at three  
queried the german 
 i mustn t be late  
levin did not answer him but walked out himself with his wife 
 well what have you to say to me  
he said to her in french 
he did not look her in the face and did not care to see that she in her condition was trembling all over and had a piteous crushed look 
 i   i want to say that we can t go on like this that this is misery    she said 
 the servants are here at the sideboard  he said angrily don t make a scene  
 well let s go in here  
they were standing in the passage 
kitty would have gone into the next room but there the english governess was giving tanya a lesson 
 well come into the garden  
in the garden they came upon a peasant weeding the path 
and no longer considering that the peasant could see her tear stained and his agitated face that they looked like people fleeing from some disaster they went on with rapid steps feeling that they must speak out and clear up misunderstandings must be alone together and so get rid of the misery they were both feeling 
 we can t go on like this 
it s misery 
i am wretched you are wretched 
what for  
she said when they had at last reached a solitary garden seat at a turn in the lime tree avenue 
 but tell me one thing was there in his tone anything unseemly not nice humiliatingly horrible  
he said standing before her again in the same position with his clenched fists on his chest as he had stood before her that night 
 yes  she said in a shaking voice but kostya surely you see i m not to blame 
all the morning i ve been trying to take a tone   but such people   why did he come 
how happy we were  
she said breathless with the sobs that shook her 
although nothing had been pursuing them and there was nothing to run away from and they could not possibly have found anything very delightful on that garden seat the gardener saw with astonishment that they passed him on their way home with comforted and radiant faces 
chapter    after escorting his wife upstairs levin went to dolly s part of the house 
darya alexandrovna for her part was in great distress too that day 
she was walking about the room talking angrily to a little girl who stood in the corner roaring 
 and you shall stand all day in the corner and have your dinner all alone and not see one of your dolls and i won t make you a new frock  she said not knowing how to punish her 
 oh she is a disgusting child  
she turned to levin 
 where does she get such wicked propensities  
 why what has she done  
levin said without much interest for he had wanted to ask her advice and so was annoyed that he had come at an unlucky moment 
 grisha and she went into the raspberries and there   i can t tell you really what she did 
it s a thousand pities miss elliot s not with us 
this one sees to nothing  she s a machine      figurez vous que la petite     
and darya alexandrovna described masha s crime 
 that proves nothing it s not a question of evil propensities at all it s simply mischief  levin assured her 
 but you are upset about something 
what have you come for  
asked dolly 
 what s going on there  
and in the tone of her question levin heard that it would be easy for him to say what he had meant to say 
 i ve not been in there i ve been alone in the garden with kitty 
we ve had a quarrel for the second time since   stiva came  
dolly looked at him with her shrewd comprehending eyes 
 come tell me honor bright has there been   not in kitty but in that gentleman s behavior a tone which might be unpleasant  not unpleasant but horrible offensive to a husband  
 you mean how shall i say     stay stay in the corner  
she said to masha who detecting a faint smile in her mother s face had been turning round 
 the opinion of the world would be that he is behaving as young men do behave 
il fait la cour à une jeune et jolie femme  and a husband who s a man of the world should only be flattered by it  
 yes yes  said levin gloomily but you noticed it  
 not only i but stiva noticed it 
just after breakfast he said to me in so many words  je crois que veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour à kitty  
 well that s all right then now i m satisfied 
i ll send him away  said levin 
 what do you mean 
are you crazy  
dolly cried in horror nonsense kostya only think  
she said laughing 
 you can go now to fanny  she said to masha 
 no if you wish it i ll speak to stiva 
he ll take him away 
he can say you re expecting visitors 
altogether he doesn t fit into the house  
 no no i ll do it myself  
 but you ll quarrel with him  
 not a bit 
i shall so enjoy it  levin said his eyes flashing with real enjoyment 
 come forgive her dolly she won t do it again  he said of the little sinner who had not gone to fanny but was standing irresolutely before her mother waiting and looking up from under her brows to catch her mother s eye 
the mother glanced at her 
the child broke into sobs hid her face on her mother s lap and dolly laid her thin tender hand on her head 
 and what is there in common between us and him  
thought levin and he went off to look for veslovsky 
as he passed through the passage he gave orders for the carriage to be got ready to drive to the station 
 the spring was broken yesterday  said the footman 
 well the covered trap then and make haste 
where s the visitor  
 the gentleman s gone to his room  
levin came upon veslovsky at the moment when the latter having unpacked his things from his trunk and laid out some new songs was putting on his gaiters to go out riding 
whether there was something exceptional in levin s face or that vassenka was himself conscious that  ce petit brin de cour  he was making was out of place in this family but he was somewhat as much as a young man in society can be disconcerted at levin s entrance 
 you ride in gaiters  
 yes it s much cleaner  said vassenka putting his fat leg on a chair fastening the bottom hook and smiling with simple hearted good humor 
he was undoubtedly a good natured fellow and levin felt sorry for him and ashamed of himself as his host when he saw the shy look on vassenka s face 
on the table lay a piece of stick which they had broken together that morning trying their strength 
levin took the fragment in his hands and began smashing it up breaking bits off the stick not knowing how to begin 
 i wanted      he paused but suddenly remembering kitty and everything that had happened he said looking him resolutely in the face i have ordered the horses to be put to for you  
 how so  
vassenka began in surprise 
 to drive where  
 for you to drive to the station  levin said gloomily 
 are you going away or has something happened  
 it happens that i expect visitors  said levin his strong fingers more and more rapidly breaking off the ends of the split stick 
 and i m not expecting visitors and nothing has happened but i beg you to go away 
you can explain my rudeness as you like  
vassenka drew himself up 
 i beg you to explain    he said with dignity understanding at last 
 i can t explain  levin said softly and deliberately trying to control the trembling of his jaw and you d better not ask  
and as the split ends were all broken off levin clutched the thick ends in his finger broke the stick in two and carefully caught the end as it fell 
probably the sight of those nervous fingers of the muscles he had proved that morning at gymnastics of the glittering eyes the soft voice and quivering jaws convinced vassenka better than any words 
he bowed shrugging his shoulders and smiling contemptuously 
 can i not see oblonsky  
the shrug and the smile did not irritate levin 
 what else was there for him to do  
he thought 
 i ll send him to you at once  
 what madness is this  
stepan arkadyevitch said when after hearing from his friend that he was being turned out of the house he found levin in the garden where he was walking about waiting for his guest s departure  
mais c est ridicule 
what fly has stung you 
mais c est du dernier ridicule 
what did you think if a young man     but the place where levin had been stung was evidently still sore for he turned pale again when stepan arkadyevitch would have enlarged on the reason and he himself cut him short 
 please don t go into it 
i can t help it 
i feel ashamed of how i m treating you and him 
but it won t be i imagine a great grief to him to go and his presence was distasteful to me and to my wife  
 but it s insulting to him 
et puis c est ridicule  
 and to me it s both insulting and distressing 
and i m not at fault in any way and there s no need for me to suffer  
 well this i didn t expect of you 
on peut être jaloux mais à ce point c est du dernier ridicule 
levin turned quickly and walked away from him into the depths of the avenue and he went on walking up and down alone 
soon he heard the rumble of the trap and saw from behind the trees how vassenka sitting in the hay unluckily there was no seat in the trap in his scotch cap was driven along the avenue jolting up and down over the ruts 
 what s this  
levin thought when a footman ran out of the house and stopped the trap 
it was the mechanician whom levin had totally forgotten 
the mechanician bowing low said something to veslovsky then clambered into the trap and they drove off together 
stepan arkadyevitch and the princess were much upset by levin s action 
and he himself felt not only in the highest degree ridicule  but also utterly guilty and disgraced 
but remembering what sufferings he and his wife had been through when he asked himself how he should act another time he answered that he should do just the same again 
in spite of all this towards the end of that day everyone except the princess who could not pardon levin s action became extraordinarily lively and good humored like children after a punishment or grown up people after a dreary ceremonious reception so that by the evening vassenka s dismissal was spoken of in the absence of the princess as though it were some remote event 
and dolly who had inherited her father s gift of humorous storytelling made varenka helpless with laughter as she related for the third and fourth time always with fresh humorous additions how she had only just put on her new shoes for the benefit of the visitor and on going into the drawing room heard suddenly the rumble of the trap 
and who should be in the trap but vassenka himself with his scotch cap and his songs and his gaiters and all sitting in the hay 
 if only you d ordered out the carriage 
but no 
and then i hear stop  
oh i thought they ve relented 
i look out and behold a fat german being sat down by him and driving away    and my new shoes all for nothing     
chapter    darya alexandrovna carried out her intention and went to see anna 
she was sorry to annoy her sister and to do anything levin disliked 
she quite understood how right the levins were in not wishing to have anything to do with vronsky 
but she felt she must go and see anna and show her that her feelings could not be changed in spite of the change in her position 
that she might be independent of the levins in this expedition darya alexandrovna sent to the village to hire horses for the drive but levin learning of it went to her to protest 
 what makes you suppose that i dislike your going 
but even if i did dislike it i should still more dislike your not taking my horses  he said 
 you never told me that you were going for certain 
hiring horses in the village is disagreeable to me and what s of more importance they ll undertake the job and never get you there 
i have horses 
and if you don t want to wound me you ll take mine  
darya alexandrovna had to consent and on the day fixed levin had ready for his sister in law a set of four horses and relays getting them together from the farm and saddle horses  not at all a smart looking set but capable of taking darya alexandrovna the whole distance in a single day 
at that moment when horses were wanted for the princess who was going and for the midwife it was a difficult matter for levin to make up the number but the duties of hospitality would not let him allow darya alexandrovna to hire horses when staying in his house 
moreover he was well aware that the twenty roubles that would be asked for the journey were a serious matter for her darya alexandrovna s pecuniary affairs which were in a very unsatisfactory state were taken to heart by the levins as if they were their own 
darya alexandrovna by levin s advice started before daybreak 
the road was good the carriage comfortable the horses trotted along merrily and on the box besides the coachman sat the counting house clerk whom levin was sending instead of a groom for greater security 
darya alexandrovna dozed and waked up only on reaching the inn where the horses were to be changed 
after drinking tea at the same well to do peasant s with whom levin had stayed on the way to sviazhsky s and chatting with the women about their children and with the old man about count vronsky whom the latter praised very highly darya alexandrovna at ten o clock went on again 
at home looking after her children she had no time to think 
so now after this journey of four hours all the thoughts she had suppressed before rushed swarming into her brain and she thought over all her life as she never had before and from the most different points of view 
her thoughts seemed strange even to herself 
at first she thought about the children about whom she was uneasy although the princess and kitty she reckoned more upon her had promised to look after them 
 if only masha does not begin her naughty tricks if grisha isn t kicked by a horse and lily s stomach isn t upset again  
she thought 
but these questions of the present were succeeded by questions of the immediate future 
she began thinking how she had to get a new flat in moscow for the coming winter to renew the drawing room furniture and to make her elder girl a cloak 
then questions of the more remote future occurred to her how she was to place her children in the world 
 the girls are all right  she thought but the boys  
 it s very well that i m teaching grisha but of course that s only because i am free myself now i m not with child 
stiva of course there s no counting on 
and with the help of good natured friends i can bring them up but if there s another baby coming     
and the thought struck her how untruly it was said that the curse laid on woman was that in sorrow she should bring forth children 
 the birth itself that s nothing but the months of carrying the child  that s what s so intolerable  she thought picturing to herself her last pregnancy and the death of the last baby 
and she recalled the conversation she had just had with the young woman at the inn 
on being asked whether she had any children the handsome young woman had answered cheerfully  i had a girl baby but god set me free i buried her last lent  
 well did you grieve very much for her  
asked darya alexandrovna 
 why grieve 
the old man has grandchildren enough as it is 
it was only a trouble 
no working nor nothing 
only a tie  
this answer had struck darya alexandrovna as revolting in spite of the good natured and pleasing face of the young woman but now she could not help recalling these words 
in those cynical words there was indeed a grain of truth 
 yes altogether  thought darya alexandrovna looking back over her whole existence during those fifteen years of her married life pregnancy sickness mental incapacity indifference to everything and most of all  hideousness 
kitty young and pretty as she is even kitty has lost her looks and i when i m with child become hideous i know it 
the birth the agony the hideous agonies that last moment   then the nursing the sleepless nights the fearful pains      darya alexandrovna shuddered at the mere recollection of the pain from sore breasts which she had suffered with almost every child 
 then the children s illnesses that everlasting apprehension then bringing them up evil propensities she thought of little masha s crime among the raspberries  education latin  it s all so incomprehensible and difficult 
and on the top of it all the death of these children  
and there rose again before her imagination the cruel memory that always tore her mother s heart of the death of her last little baby who had died of croup his funeral the callous indifference of all at the little pink coffin and her own torn heart and her lonely anguish at the sight of the pale little brow with its projecting temples and the open wondering little mouth seen in the coffin at the moment when it was being covered with the little pink lid with a cross braided on it 
 and all this what s it for 
what is to come of it all 
that i m  wasting my life never having a moment s peace either with child or nursing a child forever irritable peevish wretched myself and worrying others repulsive to my husband while the children are growing up unhappy badly educated and penniless 
even now if it weren t for spending the summer at the levins  i don t know how we should be managing to live 
of course kostya and kitty have so much tact that we don t feel it but it can t go on 
they ll have children they won t be able to keep us it s a drag on them as it is 
how is papa who has hardly anything left for himself to help us 
so that i can t even bring the children up by myself and may find it hard with the help of other people at the cost of humiliation 
why even if we suppose the greatest good luck that the children don t die and i bring them up somehow 
at the very best they ll simply be decent people 
that s all i can hope for 
and to gain simply that  what agonies what toil    
one s whole life ruined  
again she recalled what the young peasant woman had said and again she was revolted at the thought but she could not help admitting that there was a grain of brutal truth in the words 
 is it far now mihail  
darya alexandrovna asked the counting house clerk to turn her mind from thoughts that were frightening her 
 from this village they say it s five miles  
the carriage drove along the village street and onto a bridge 
on the bridge was a crowd of peasant women with coils of ties for the sheaves on their shoulders gaily and noisily chattering 
they stood still on the bridge staring inquisitively at the carriage 
all the faces turned to darya alexandrovna looked to her healthy and happy making her envious of their enjoyment of life 
 they re all living they re all enjoying life  darya alexandrovna still mused when she had passed the peasant women and was driving uphill again at a trot seated comfortably on the soft springs of the old carriage while i let out as it were from prison from the world of worries that fret me to death am only looking about me now for an instant 
they all live those peasant women and my sister natalia and varenka and anna whom i am going to see  all but not i 
 and they attack anna 
what for 
am i any better 
i have anyway a husband i love  not as i should like to love him still i do love him while anna never loved hers 
how is she to blame 
she wants to live 
god has put that in our hearts 
very likely i should have done the same 
even to this day i don t feel sure i did right in listening to her at that terrible time when she came to me in moscow 
i ought then to have cast off my husband and have begun my life fresh 
i might have loved and have been loved in reality 
and is it any better as it is 
i don t respect him 
he s necessary to me  she thought about her husband and i put up with him 
is that any better 
at that time i could still have been admired i had beauty left me still  darya alexandrovna pursued her thoughts and she would have liked to look at herself in the looking glass 
she had a traveling looking glass in her handbag and she wanted to take it out but looking at the backs of the coachman and the swaying counting house clerk she felt that she would be ashamed if either of them were to look round and she did not take out the glass 
but without looking in the glass she thought that even now it was not too late and she thought of sergey ivanovitch who was always particularly attentive to her of stiva s good hearted friend turovtsin who had helped her nurse her children through the scarlatina and was in love with her 
and there was someone else a quite young man who  her husband had told her it as a joke  thought her more beautiful than either of her sisters 
and the most passionate and impossible romances rose before darya alexandrovna s imagination 
 anna did quite right and certainly i shall never reproach her for it 
she is happy she makes another person happy and she s not broken down as i am but most likely just as she always was bright clever open to every impression  thought darya alexandrovna   and a sly smile curved her lips for as she pondered on anna s love affair darya alexandrovna constructed on parallel lines an almost identical love affair for herself with an imaginary composite figure the ideal man who was in love with her 
she like anna confessed the whole affair to her husband 
and the amazement and perplexity of stepan arkadyevitch at this avowal made her smile 
in such daydreams she reached the turning of the highroad that led to vozdvizhenskoe 
chapter    the coachman pulled up his four horses and looked round to the right to a field of rye where some peasants were sitting on a cart 
the counting house clerk was just going to jump down but on second thoughts he shouted peremptorily to the peasants instead and beckoned to them to come up 
the wind that seemed to blow as they drove dropped when the carriage stood still gadflies settled on the steaming horses that angrily shook them off 
the metallic clank of a whetstone against a scythe that came to them from the cart ceased 
one of the peasants got up and came towards the carriage 
 well you are slow  
the counting house clerk shouted angrily to the peasant who was stepping slowly with his bare feet over the ruts of the rough dry road 
 come along do  
a curly headed old man with a bit of bast tied round his hair and his bent back dark with perspiration came towards the carriage quickening his steps and took hold of the mud guard with his sunburnt hand 
 vozdvizhenskoe the manor house 
the count s  
he repeated go on to the end of this track 
then turn to the left 
straight along the avenue and you ll come right upon it 
but whom do you want 
the count himself  
 well are they at home my good man  
darya alexandrovna said vaguely not knowing how to ask about anna even of this peasant 
 at home for sure  said the peasant shifting from one bare foot to the other and leaving a distinct print of five toes and a heel in the dust 
 sure to be at home  he repeated evidently eager to talk 
 only yesterday visitors arrived 
there s a sight of visitors come 
what do you want  
he turned round and called to a lad who was shouting something to him from the cart 
 oh 
they all rode by here not long since to look at a reaping machine 
they ll be home by now 
and who will you be belonging to     
 we ve come a long way  said the coachman climbing onto the box 
 so it s not far  
 i tell you it s just here 
as soon as you get out    he said keeping hold all the while of the carriage 
a healthy looking broad shouldered young fellow came up too 
 what is it laborers they want for the harvest  
he asked 
 i don t know my boy  
 so you keep to the left and you ll come right on it  said the peasant unmistakably loth to let the travelers go and eager to converse 
the coachman started the horses but they were only just turning off when the peasant shouted stop 
hi friend 
stop  
called the two voices 
the coachman stopped 
 they re coming 
they re yonder  
shouted the peasant 
 see what a turn out  
he said pointing to four persons on horseback and two in a  char à banc  coming along the road 
they were vronsky with a jockey veslovsky and anna on horseback and princess varvara and sviazhsky in the  char à banc 
they had gone out to look at the working of a new reaping machine 
when the carriage stopped the party on horseback were coming at a walking pace 
anna was in front beside veslovsky 
anna quietly walking her horse a sturdy english cob with cropped mane and short tail her beautiful head with her black hair straying loose under her high hat her full shoulders her slender waist in her black riding habit and all the ease and grace of her deportment impressed dolly 
for the first minute it seemed to her unsuitable for anna to be on horseback 
the conception of riding on horseback for a lady was in darya alexandrovna s mind associated with ideas of youthful flirtation and frivolity which in her opinion was unbecoming in anna s position 
but when she had scrutinized her seeing her closer she was at once reconciled to her riding 
in spite of her elegance everything was so simple quiet and dignified in the attitude the dress and the movements of anna that nothing could have been more natural 
beside anna on a hot looking gray cavalry horse was vassenka veslovsky in his scotch cap with floating ribbons his stout legs stretched out in front obviously pleased with his own appearance 
darya alexandrovna could not suppress a good humored smile as she recognized him 
behind rode vronsky on a dark bay mare obviously heated from galloping 
he was holding her in pulling at the reins 
after him rode a little man in the dress of a jockey 
sviazhsky and princess varvara in a new  char à banc  with a big raven black trotting horse overtook the party on horseback 
anna s face suddenly beamed with a joyful smile at the instant when in the little figure huddled in a corner of the old carriage she recognized dolly 
she uttered a cry started in the saddle and set her horse into a gallop 
on reaching the carriage she jumped off without assistance and holding up her riding habit she ran up to greet dolly 
 i thought it was you and dared not think it 
how delightful 
you can t fancy how glad i am  
she said at one moment pressing her face against dolly and kissing her and at the next holding her off and examining her with a smile 
 here s a delightful surprise alexey  
she said looking round at vronsky who had dismounted and was walking towards them 
vronsky taking off his tall gray hat went up to dolly 
 you wouldn t believe how glad we are to see you  he said giving peculiar significance to the words and showing his strong white teeth in a smile 
vassenka veslovsky without getting off his horse took off his cap and greeted the visitor by gleefully waving the ribbons over his head 
 that s princess varvara  anna said in reply to a glance of inquiry from dolly as the  char à banc  drove up 
 ah  
said darya alexandrovna and unconsciously her face betrayed her dissatisfaction 
princess varvara was her husband s aunt and she had long known her and did not respect her 
she knew that princess varvara had passed her whole life toadying on her rich relations but that she should now be sponging on vronsky a man who was nothing to her mortified dolly on account of her kinship with her husband 
anna noticed dolly s expression and was disconcerted by it 
she blushed dropped her riding habit and stumbled over it 
darya alexandrovna went up to the  char à banc  and coldly greeted princess varvara 
sviazhsky too she knew 
he inquired how his queer friend with the young wife was and running his eyes over the ill matched horses and the carriage with its patched mud guards proposed to the ladies that they should get into the char à banc 
 and i ll get into this vehicle  he said 
 the horse is quiet and the princess drives capitally  
 no stay as you were  said anna coming up and we ll go in the carriage  and taking dolly s arm she drew her away 
darya alexandrovna s eyes were fairly dazzled by the elegant carriage of a pattern she had never seen before the splendid horses and the elegant and gorgeous people surrounding her 
but what struck her most of all was the change that had taken place in anna whom she knew so well and loved 
any other woman a less close observer not knowing anna before or not having thought as darya alexandrovna had been thinking on the road would not have noticed anything special in anna 
but now dolly was struck by that temporary beauty which is only found in women during the moments of love and which she saw now in anna s face 
everything in her face the clearly marked dimples in her cheeks and chin the line of her lips the smile which as it were fluttered about her face the brilliance of her eyes the grace and rapidity of her movements the fulness of the notes of her voice even the manner in which with a sort of angry friendliness she answered veslovsky when he asked permission to get on her cob so as to teach it to gallop with the right leg foremost  it was all peculiarly fascinating and it seemed as if she were herself aware of it and rejoicing in it 
when both the women were seated in the carriage a sudden embarrassment came over both of them 
anna was disconcerted by the intent look of inquiry dolly fixed upon her 
dolly was embarrassed because after sviazhsky s phrase about this vehicle  she could not help feeling ashamed of the dirty old carriage in which anna was sitting with her 
the coachman philip and the counting house clerk were experiencing the same sensation 
the counting house clerk to conceal his confusion busied himself settling the ladies but philip the coachman became sullen and was bracing himself not to be overawed in future by this external superiority 
he smiled ironically looking at the raven horse and was already deciding in his own mind that this smart trotter in the  char à banc  was only good for promenade  and wouldn t do thirty miles straight off in the heat 
the peasants had all got up from the cart and were inquisitively and mirthfully staring at the meeting of the friends making their comments on it 
 they re pleased too haven t seen each other for a long while  said the curly headed old man with the bast round his hair 
 i say uncle gerasim if we could take that raven horse now to cart the corn that ud be quick work  
 look ee 
is that a woman in breeches  
said one of them pointing to vassenka veslovsky sitting in a side saddle 
 nay a man 
see how smartly he s going it  
 eh lads 
seems we re not going to sleep then  
 what chance of sleep today  
said the old man with a sidelong look at the sun 
 midday s past look ee 
get your hooks and come along  
chapter    anna looked at dolly s thin care worn face with its wrinkles filled with dust from the road and she was on the point of saying what she was thinking that is that dolly had got thinner 
but conscious that she herself had grown handsomer and that dolly s eyes were telling her so she sighed and began to speak about herself 
 you are looking at me  she said and wondering how i can be happy in my position 
well 
it s shameful to confess but i   
i m inexcusably happy 
something magical has happened to me like a dream when you re frightened panic stricken and all of a sudden you wake up and all the horrors are no more 
i have waked up 
i have lived through the misery the dread and now for a long while past especially since we ve been here i ve been so happy     
she said with a timid smile of inquiry looking at dolly 
 how glad i am  
said dolly smiling involuntarily speaking more coldly than she wanted to 
 i m very glad for you 
why haven t you written to me  
 why    
because i hadn t the courage     you forget my position     to me 
hadn t the courage 
if you knew how i   i look at     darya alexandrovna wanted to express her thoughts of the morning but for some reason it seemed to her now out of place to do so 
 but of that we ll talk later 
what s this what are all these buildings  
she asked wanting to change the conversation and pointing to the red and green roofs that came into view behind the green hedges of acacia and lilac 
 quite a little town  
but anna did not answer 
 no no 
how do you look at my position what do you think of it  
she asked 
 i consider    darya alexandrovna was beginning but at that instant vassenka veslovsky having brought the cob to gallop with the right leg foremost galloped past them bumping heavily up and down in his short jacket on the chamois leather of the side saddle 
 he s doing it anna arkadyevna  
he shouted 
anna did not even glance at him but again it seemed to darya alexandrovna out of place to enter upon such a long conversation in the carriage and so she cut short her thought 
 i don t think anything  she said but i always loved you and if one loves anyone one loves the whole person just as they are and not as one would like them to be      anna taking her eyes off her friend s face and dropping her eyelids this was a new habit dolly had not seen in her before  pondered trying to penetrate the full significance of the words 
and obviously interpreting them as she would have wished she glanced at dolly 
 if you had any sins  she said they would all be forgiven you for your coming to see me and these words  
and dolly saw that tears stood in her eyes 
she pressed anna s hand in silence 
 well what are these buildings 
how many there are of them  
after a moment s silence she repeated her question 
 these are the servants houses barns and stables  answered anna 
 and there the park begins 
it had all gone to ruin but alexey had everything renewed 
he is very fond of this place and what i never expected he has become intensely interested in looking after it 
but his is such a rich nature 
whatever he takes up he does splendidly 
so far from being bored by it he works with passionate interest 
he  with his temperament as i know it  he has become careful and businesslike a first rate manager he positively reckons every penny in his management of the land 
but only in that 
when it s a question of tens of thousands he doesn t think of money  
she spoke with that gleefully sly smile with which women often talk of the secret characteristics only known to them  of those they love 
 do you see that big building 
that s the new hospital 
i believe it will cost over a hundred thousand that s his hobby just now 
and do you know how it all came about 
the peasants asked him for some meadowland i think it was at a cheaper rate and he refused and i accused him of being miserly 
of course it was not really because of that but everything together he began this hospital to prove do you see that he was not miserly about money 
c est une petitesse  if you like but i love him all the more for it 
and now you ll see the house in a moment 
it was his grandfather s house and he has had nothing changed outside  
 how beautiful  
said dolly looking with involuntary admiration at the handsome house with columns standing out among the different colored greens of the old trees in the garden 
 isn t it fine 
and from the house from the top the view is wonderful  
they drove into a courtyard strewn with gravel and bright with flowers in which two laborers were at work putting an edging of stones round the light mould of a flower bed and drew up in a covered entry 
 ah they re here already  
said anna looking at the saddle horses which were just being led away from the steps 
 it is a nice horse isn t it 
it s my cob my favorite 
lead him here and bring me some sugar 
where is the count  
she inquired of two smart footmen who darted out 
 ah there he is  
she said seeing vronsky coming to meet her with veslovsky 
 where are you going to put the princess  
said vronsky in french addressing anna and without waiting for a reply he once more greeted darya alexandrovna and this time he kissed her hand 
 i think the big balcony room  
 oh no that s too far off 
better in the corner room we shall see each other more 
come let s go up  said anna as she gave her favorite horse the sugar the footman had brought her  
et vous oubliez votre devoir  she said to veslovsky who came out too on the steps  
pardon j en ai tout plein les poches  he answered smiling putting his fingers in his waistcoat pocket  
mais vous venez trop tard  she said rubbing her handkerchief on her hand which the horse had made wet in taking the sugar 
anna turned to dolly 
 you can stay some time 
for one day only 
that s impossible  
 i promised to be back and the children    said dolly feeling embarrassed both because she had to get her bag out of the carriage and because she knew her face must be covered with dust 
 no dolly darling    
well we ll see 
come along come along  
and anna led dolly to her room 
that room was not the smart guest chamber vronsky had suggested but the one of which anna had said that dolly would excuse it 
and this room for which excuse was needed was more full of luxury than any in which dolly had ever stayed a luxury that reminded her of the best hotels abroad 
 well darling how happy i am  
anna said sitting down in her riding habit for a moment beside dolly 
 tell me about all of you 
stiva i had only a glimpse of and he cannot tell one about the children 
how is my favorite tanya 
quite a big girl i expect  
 yes she s very tall  darya alexandrovna answered shortly surprised herself that she should respond so coolly about her children 
 we are having a delightful stay at the levins   she added 
 oh if i had known  said anna that you do not despise me    
you might have all come to us 
stiva s an old friend and a great friend of alexey s you know  she added and suddenly she blushed 
 yes but we are all    dolly answered in confusion 
 but in my delight i m talking nonsense 
the one thing darling is that i am so glad to have you  
said anna kissing her again 
 you haven t told me yet how and what you think about me and i keep wanting to know 
but i m glad you will see me as i am 
the chief thing i shouldn t like would be for people to imagine i want to prove anything 
i don t want to prove anything i merely want to live to do no one harm but myself 
i have the right to do that haven t i 
but it is a big subject and we ll talk over everything properly later 
now i ll go and dress and send a maid to you  
chapter    left alone darya alexandrovna with a good housewife s eye scanned her room 
all she had seen in entering the house and walking through it and all she saw now in her room gave her an impression of wealth and sumptuousness and of that modern european luxury of which she had only read in english novels but had never seen in russia and in the country 
everything was new from the new french hangings on the walls to the carpet which covered the whole floor 
the bed had a spring mattress and a special sort of bolster and silk pillowcases on the little pillows 
the marble washstand the dressing table the little sofa the tables the bronze clock on the chimney piece the window curtains and the  portières  were all new and expensive 
the smart maid who came in to offer her services with her hair done up high and a gown more fashionable than dolly s was as new and expensive as the whole room 
darya alexandrovna liked her neatness her deferential and obliging manners but she felt ill at ease with her 
she felt ashamed of her seeing the patched dressing jacket that had unluckily been packed by mistake for her 
she was ashamed of the very patches and darned places of which she had been so proud at home 
at home it had been so clear that for six dressing jackets there would be needed twenty four yards of nainsook at sixteen pence the yard which was a matter of thirty shillings besides the cutting out and making and these thirty shillings had been saved 
but before the maid she felt if not exactly ashamed at least uncomfortable 
darya alexandrovna had a great sense of relief when annushka whom she had known for years walked in 
the smart maid was sent for to go to her mistress and annushka remained with darya alexandrovna 
annushka was obviously much pleased at that lady s arrival and began to chatter away without a pause 
dolly observed that she was longing to express her opinion in regard to her mistress s position especially as to the love and devotion of the count to anna arkadyevna but dolly carefully interrupted her whenever she began to speak about this 
 i grew up with anna arkadyevna my lady s dearer to me than anything 
well it s not for us to judge 
and to be sure there seems so much love     kindly pour out the water for me to wash now please  darya alexandrovna cut her short 
 certainly 
we ve two women kept specially for washing small things but most of the linen s done by machinery 
the count goes into everything himself 
ah what a husband     
dolly was glad when anna came in and by her entrance put a stop to annushka s gossip 
anna had put on a very simple batiste gown 
dolly scrutinized that simple gown attentively 
she knew what it meant and the price at which such simplicity was obtained 
 an old friend  said anna of annushka 
anna was not embarrassed now 
she was perfectly composed and at ease 
dolly saw that she had now completely recovered from the impression her arrival had made on her and had assumed that superficial careless tone which as it were closed the door on that compartment in which her deeper feelings and ideas were kept 
 well anna and how is your little girl  
asked dolly 
 annie  
 this was what she called her little daughter anna  
 very well 
she has got on wonderfully 
would you like to see her 
come i ll show her to you 
we had a terrible bother  she began telling her over nurses 
we had an italian wet nurse 
a good creature but so stupid 
we wanted to get rid of her but the baby is so used to her that we ve gone on keeping her still  
 but how have you managed     
dolly was beginning a question as to what name the little girl would have but noticing a sudden frown on anna s face she changed the drift of her question 
 how did you manage 
have you weaned her yet  
but anna had understood 
 you didn t mean to ask that 
you meant to ask about her surname 
yes 
that worries alexey 
she has no name  that is she s a karenina  said anna dropping her eyelids till nothing could be seen but the eyelashes meeting 
 but we ll talk about all that later  her face suddenly brightening 
 come i ll show you her 
elle est tres gentille 
she crawls now  
in the nursery the luxury which had impressed dolly in the whole house struck her still more 
there were little go carts ordered from england and appliances for learning to walk and a sofa after the fashion of a billiard table purposely constructed for crawling and swings and baths all of special pattern and modern 
they were all english solid and of good make and obviously very expensive 
the room was large and very light and lofty 
when they went in the baby with nothing on but her little smock was sitting in a little elbow chair at the table having her dinner of broth which she was spilling all over her little chest 
the baby was being fed and the russian nursery maid was evidently sharing her meal 
neither the wet nurse nor the head nurse were there they were in the next room from which came the sound of their conversation in the queer french which was their only means of communication 
hearing anna s voice a smart tall english nurse with a disagreeable face and a dissolute expression walked in at the door hurriedly shaking her fair curls and immediately began to defend herself though anna had not found fault with her 
at every word anna said the english nurse said hurriedly several times yes my lady  
the rosy baby with her black eyebrows and hair her sturdy red little body with tight goose flesh skin delighted darya alexandrovna in spite of the cross expression with which she stared at the stranger 
she positively envied the baby s healthy appearance 
she was delighted too at the baby s crawling 
not one of her own children had crawled like that 
when the baby was put on the carpet and its little dress tucked up behind it was wonderfully charming 
looking round like some little wild animal at the grown up big people with her bright black eyes she smiled unmistakably pleased at their admiring her and holding her legs sideways she pressed vigorously on her arms and rapidly drew her whole back up after and then made another step forward with her little arms 
but the whole atmosphere of the nursery and especially the english nurse darya alexandrovna did not like at all 
it was only on the supposition that no good nurse would have entered so irregular a household as anna s that darya alexandrovna could explain to herself how anna with her insight into people could take such an unprepossessing disreputable looking woman as nurse to her child 
besides from a few words that were dropped darya alexandrovna saw at once that anna the two nurses and the child had no common existence and that the mother s visit was something exceptional 
anna wanted to get the baby her plaything and could not find it 
most amazing of all was the fact that on being asked how many teeth the baby had anna answered wrong and knew nothing about the two last teeth 
 i sometimes feel sorry i m so superfluous here  said anna going out of the nursery and holding up her skirt so as to escape the plaything standing in the doorway 
 it was very different with my first child  
 i expected it to be the other way  said darya alexandrovna shyly 
 oh no 
by the way do you know i saw seryozha  
said anna screwing up her eyes as though looking at something far away 
 but we ll talk about that later 
you wouldn t believe it i m like a hungry beggar woman when a full dinner is set before her and she does not know what to begin on first 
the dinner is you and the talks i have before me with you which i could never have with anyone else and i don t know which subject to begin upon first 
mais je ne vous ferai grace de rien 
i must have everything out with you  
 oh i ought to give you a sketch of the company you will meet with us  she went on 
 i ll begin with the ladies 
princess varvara  you know her and i know your opinion and stiva s about her 
stiva says the whole aim of her existence is to prove her superiority over auntie katerina pavlovna that s all true but she s a good natured woman and i am so grateful to her 
in petersburg there was a moment when a chaperon was absolutely essential for me 
then she turned up 
but really she is good natured 
she did a great deal to alleviate my position 
i see you don t understand all the difficulty of my position   there in petersburg  she added 
 here i m perfectly at ease and happy 
well of that later on though 
then sviazhsky  he s the marshal of the district and he s a very good sort of a man but he wants to get something out of alexey 
you understand with his property now that we are settled in the country alexey can exercise great influence 
then there s tushkevitch  you have seen him you know  betsy s admirer 
now he s been thrown over and he s come to see us 
as alexey says he s one of those people who are very pleasant if one accepts them for what they try to appear to be  et puis il est comme il faut  as princess varvara says 
then veslovsky   you know him 
a very nice boy  she said and a sly smile curved her lips 
 what s this wild story about him and the levins 
veslovsky told alexey about it and we don t believe it 
il est très gentil et naïf  she said again with the same smile 
 men need occupation and alexey needs a circle so i value all these people 
we have to have the house lively and gay so that alexey may not long for any novelty 
then you ll see the steward  a german a very good fellow and he understands his work 
alexey has a very high opinion of him 
then the doctor a young man not quite a nihilist perhaps but you know eats with his knife   but a very good doctor 
then the architect      une petite cour 
chapter    here s dolly for you princess you were so anxious to see her  said anna coming out with darya alexandrovna onto the stone terrace where princess varvara was sitting in the shade at an embroidery frame working at a cover for count alexey kirillovitch s easy chair 
 she says she doesn t want anything before dinner but please order some lunch for her and i ll go and look for alexey and bring them all in  
princess varvara gave dolly a cordial and rather patronizing reception and began at once explaining to her that she was living with anna because she had always cared more for her than her sister katerina pavlovna the aunt that had brought anna up and that now when every one had abandoned anna she thought it her duty to help her in this most difficult period of transition 
 her husband will give her a divorce and then i shall go back to my solitude but now i can be of use and i am doing my duty however difficult it may be for me  not like some other people 
and how sweet it is of you how right of you to have come 
they live like the best of married couples it s for god to judge them not for us 
and didn t biryuzovsky and madame avenieva   and sam nikandrov and vassiliev and madame mamonova and liza neptunova    did no one say anything about them 
and it has ended by their being received by everyone 
and then c est un intérieur si joli si comme il faut 
tout à fait à l anglaise 
on se réunit le matin au breakfast et puis on se sépare 
everyone does as he pleases till dinnertime 
dinner at seven o clock 
stiva did very rightly to send you 
he needs their support 
you know that through his mother and brother he can do anything 
and then they do so much good 
he didn t tell you about his hospital 
ce sera admirable  everything from paris  
their conversation was interrupted by anna who had found the men of the party in the billiard room and returned with them to the terrace 
there was still a long time before the dinner hour it was exquisite weather and so several different methods of spending the next two hours were proposed 
there were very many methods of passing the time at vozdvizhenskoe and these were all unlike those in use at pokrovskoe  
une partie de lawn tennis  veslovsky proposed with his handsome smile 
 we ll be partners again anna arkadyevna  
 no it s too hot better stroll about the garden and have a row in the boat show darya alexandrovna the river banks  
vronsky proposed 
 i agree to anything  said sviazhsky 
 i imagine that what dolly would like best would be a stroll  wouldn t you 
and then the boat perhaps  said anna 
so it was decided 
veslovsky and tushkevitch went off to the bathing place promising to get the boat ready and to wait there for them 
they walked along the path in two couples anna with sviazhsky and dolly with vronsky 
dolly was a little embarrassed and anxious in the new surroundings in which she found herself 
abstractly theoretically she did not merely justify she positively approved of anna s conduct 
as is indeed not unfrequent with women of unimpeachable virtue weary of the monotony of respectable existence at a distance she not only excused illicit love she positively envied it 
besides she loved anna with all her heart 
but seeing anna in actual life among these strangers with this fashionable tone that was so new to darya alexandrovna she felt ill at ease 
what she disliked particularly was seeing princess varvara ready to overlook everything for the sake of the comforts she enjoyed 
as a general principle abstractly dolly approved of anna s action but to see the man for whose sake her action had been taken was disagreeable to her 
moreover she had never liked vronsky 
she thought him very proud and saw nothing in him of which he could be proud except his wealth 
but against her own will here in his own house he overawed her more than ever and she could not be at ease with him 
she felt with him the same feeling she had had with the maid about her dressing jacket 
just as with the maid she had felt not exactly ashamed but embarrassed at her darns so she felt with him not exactly ashamed but embarrassed at herself 
dolly was ill at ease and tried to find a subject of conversation 
even though she supposed that through his pride praise of his house and garden would be sure to be disagreeable to him she did all the same tell him how much she liked his house 
 yes it s a very fine building and in the good old fashioned style  he said 
 i like so much the court in front of the steps 
was that always so  
 oh no  
he said and his face beamed with pleasure 
 if you could only have seen that court last spring  
and he began at first rather diffidently but more and more carried away by the subject as he went on to draw her attention to the various details of the decoration of his house and garden 
it was evident that having devoted a great deal of trouble to improve and beautify his home vronsky felt a need to show off the improvements to a new person and was genuinely delighted at darya alexandrovna s praise 
 if you would care to look at the hospital and are not tired indeed it s not far 
shall we go  
he said glancing into her face to convince himself that she was not bored 
 are you coming anna  
he turned to her 
 we will come won t we  
she said addressing sviazhsky  
mais il ne faut pas laisser le pauvre veslovsky et tushkevitch se morfondre là dans le bateau 
we must send and tell them  
 yes this is a monument he is setting up here  said anna turning to dolly with that sly smile of comprehension with which she had previously talked about the hospital 
 oh it s a work of real importance  
said sviazhsky 
but to show he was not trying to ingratiate himself with vronsky he promptly added some slightly critical remarks 
 i wonder though count  he said that while you do so much for the health of the peasants you take so little interest in the schools  
 c est devenu tellement commun les écoles  said vronsky 
 you understand it s not on that account but it just happens so my interest has been diverted elsewhere 
this way then to the hospital  he said to darya alexandrovna pointing to a turning out of the avenue 
the ladies put up their parasols and turned into the side path 
after going down several turnings and going through a little gate darya alexandrovna saw standing on rising ground before her a large pretentious looking red building almost finished 
the iron roof which was not yet painted shone with dazzling brightness in the sunshine 
beside the finished building another had been begun surrounded by scaffolding 
workmen in aprons standing on scaffolds were laying bricks pouring mortar out of vats and smoothing it with trowels 
 how quickly work gets done with you  
said sviazhsky 
 when i was here last time the roof was not on  
 by the autumn it will all be ready 
inside almost everything is done  said anna 
 and what s this new building  
 that s the house for the doctor and the dispensary  answered vronsky seeing the architect in a short jacket coming towards him and excusing himself to the ladies he went to meet him 
going round a hole where the workmen were slaking lime he stood still with the architect and began talking rather warmly 
 the front is still too low  he said to anna who had asked what was the matter 
 i said the foundation ought to be raised  said anna 
 yes of course it would have been much better anna arkadyevna  said the architect but now it s too late  
 yes i take a great interest in it  anna answered sviazhsky who was expressing his surprise at her knowledge of architecture 
 this new building ought to have been in harmony with the hospital 
it was an afterthought and was begun without a plan  
vronsky having finished his talk with the architect joined the ladies and led them inside the hospital 
although they were still at work on the cornices outside and were painting on the ground floor upstairs almost all the rooms were finished 
going up the broad cast iron staircase to the landing they walked into the first large room 
the walls were stuccoed to look like marble the huge plate glass windows were already in only the parquet floor was not yet finished and the carpenters who were planing a block of it left their work taking off the bands that fastened their hair to greet the gentry 
 this is the reception room  said vronsky 
 here there will be a desk tables and benches and nothing more  
 this way let us go in here 
don t go near the window  said anna trying the paint to see if it were dry 
 alexey the paint s dry already  she added 
from the reception room they went into the corridor 
here vronsky showed them the mechanism for ventilation on a novel system 
then he showed them marble baths and beds with extraordinary springs 
then he showed them the wards one after another the storeroom the linen room then the heating stove of a new pattern then the trolleys which would make no noise as they carried everything needed along the corridors and many other things 
sviazhsky as a connoisseur in the latest mechanical improvements appreciated everything fully 
dolly simply wondered at all she had not seen before and anxious to understand it all made minute inquiries about everything which gave vronsky great satisfaction 
 yes i imagine that this will be the solitary example of a properly fitted hospital in russia  said sviazhsky 
 and won t you have a lying in ward  
asked dolly 
 that s so much needed in the country 
i have often     in spite of his usual courtesy vronsky interrupted her 
 this is not a lying in home but a hospital for the sick and is intended for all diseases except infectious complaints  he said 
 ah 
look at this  and he rolled up to darya alexandrovna an invalid chair that had just been ordered for the convalescents 
 look  
he sat down in the chair and began moving it 
 the patient can t walk  still too weak perhaps or something wrong with his legs but he must have air and he moves rolls himself along      darya alexandrovna was interested by everything 
she liked everything very much but most of all she liked vronsky himself with his natural simple hearted eagerness 
 yes he s a very nice good man  she thought several times not hearing what he said but looking at him and penetrating into his expression while she mentally put herself in anna s place 
she liked him so much just now with his eager interest that she saw how anna could be in love with him 
chapter    no i think the princess is tired and horses don t interest her  vronsky said to anna who wanted to go on to the stables where sviazhsky wished to see the new stallion 
 you go on while i escort the princess home and we ll have a little talk  he said if you would like that  
he added turning to her 
 i know nothing about horses and i shall be delighted  answered darya alexandrovna rather astonished 
she saw by vronsky s face that he wanted something from her 
she was not mistaken 
as soon as they had passed through the little gate back into the garden he looked in the direction anna had taken and having made sure that she could neither hear nor see them he began  you guess that i have something i want to say to you  he said looking at her with laughing eyes 
 i am not wrong in believing you to be a friend of anna s  
he took off his hat and taking out his handkerchief wiped his head which was growing bald 
darya alexandrovna made no answer and merely stared at him with dismay 
when she was left alone with him she suddenly felt afraid his laughing eyes and stern expression scared her 
the most diverse suppositions as to what he was about to speak of to her flashed into her brain 
 he is going to beg me to come to stay with them with the children and i shall have to refuse or to create a set that will receive anna in moscow     or isn t it vassenka veslovsky and his relations with anna 
or perhaps about kitty that he feels he was to blame  
all her conjectures were unpleasant but she did not guess what he really wanted to talk about to her 
 you have so much influence with anna she is so fond of you  he said do help me  
darya alexandrovna looked with timid inquiry into his energetic face which under the lime trees was continually being lighted up in patches by the sunshine and then passing into complete shadow again 
she waited for him to say more but he walked in silence beside her scratching with his cane in the gravel 
 you have come to see us you the only woman of anna s former friends  i don t count princess varvara  but i know that you have done this not because you regard our position as normal but because understanding all the difficulty of the position you still love her and want to be a help to her 
have i understood you rightly  
he asked looking round at her 
 oh yes  answered darya alexandrovna putting down her sunshade but     no  he broke in and unconsciously oblivious of the awkward position into which he was putting his companion he stopped abruptly so that she had to stop short too 
 no one feels more deeply and intensely than i do all the difficulty of anna s position and that you may well understand if you do me the honor of supposing i have any heart 
i am to blame for that position and that is why i feel it  
 i understand  said darya alexandrovna involuntarily admiring the sincerity and firmness with which he said this 
 but just because you feel yourself responsible you exaggerate it i am afraid  she said 
 her position in the world is difficult i can well understand  
 in the world it is hell  
he brought out quickly frowning darkly 
 you can t imagine moral sufferings greater than what she went through in petersburg in that fortnight   and i beg you to believe it  
 yes but here so long as neither anna   nor you miss society     society  
he said contemptuously how could i miss society  
 so far  and it may be so always  you are happy and at peace 
i see in anna that she is happy perfectly happy she has had time to tell me so much already  said darya alexandrovna smiling and involuntarily as she said this at the same moment a doubt entered her mind whether anna really were happy 
but vronsky it appeared had no doubts on that score 
 yes yes  he said i know that she has revived after all her sufferings she is happy 
she is happy in the present 
but i    
i am afraid of what is before us   i beg your pardon you would like to walk on  
 no i don t mind  
 well then let us sit here  
darya alexandrovna sat down on a garden seat in a corner of the avenue 
he stood up facing her 
 i see that she is happy  he repeated and the doubt whether she were happy sank more deeply into darya alexandrovna s mind 
 but can it last 
whether we have acted rightly or wrongly is another question but the die is cast  he said passing from russian to french and we are bound together for life 
we are united by all the ties of love that we hold most sacred 
we have a child we may have other children 
but the law and all the conditions of our position are such that thousands of complications arise which she does not see and does not want to see 
and that one can well understand 
but i can t help seeing them 
my daughter is by law not my daughter but karenin s 
i cannot bear this falsity  
he said with a vigorous gesture of refusal and he looked with gloomy inquiry towards darya alexandrovna 
she made no answer but simply gazed at him 
he went on  one day a son may be born my son and he will be legally a karenin he will not be the heir of my name nor of my property and however happy we may be in our home life and however many children we may have there will be no real tie between us 
they will be karenins 
you can understand the bitterness and horror of this position 
i have tried to speak of this to anna 
it irritates her 
she does not understand and to her i cannot speak plainly of all this 
now look at another side 
i am happy happy in her love but i must have occupation 
i have found occupation and am proud of what i am doing and consider it nobler than the pursuits of my former companions at court and in the army 
and most certainly i would not change the work i am doing for theirs 
i am working here settled in my own place and i am happy and contented and we need nothing more to make us happy 
i love my work here 
ce n est pas un pis aller  on the contrary     darya alexandrovna noticed that at this point in his explanation he grew confused and she did not quite understand this digression but she felt that having once begun to speak of matters near his heart of which he could not speak to anna he was now making a clean breast of everything and that the question of his pursuits in the country fell into the same category of matters near his heart as the question of his relations with anna 
 well i will go on  he said collecting himself 
 the great thing is that as i work i want to have a conviction that what i am doing will not die with me that i shall have heirs to come after me   and this i have not 
conceive the position of a man who knows that his children the children of the woman he loves will not be his but will belong to someone who hates them and cares nothing about them 
it is awful  
he paused evidently much moved 
 yes indeed i see that 
but what can anna do  
queried darya alexandrovna 
 yes that brings me to the object of my conversation  he said calming himself with an effort 
 anna can it depends on her    
even to petition the tsar for legitimization a divorce is essential 
and that depends on anna 
her husband agreed to a divorce  at that time your husband had arranged it completely 
and now i know he would not refuse it 
it is only a matter of writing to him 
he said plainly at that time that if she expressed the desire he would not refuse 
of course  he said gloomily it is one of those pharisaical cruelties of which only such heartless men are capable 
he knows what agony any recollection of him must give her and knowing her he must have a letter from her 
i can understand that it is agony to her 
but the matter is of such importance that one must  passer pardessus toutes ces finesses de sentiment 
il y va du bonheur et de l existence d anne et de ses enfants 
i won t speak of myself though it s hard for me very hard  he said with an expression as though he were threatening someone for its being hard for him 
 and so it is princess that i am shamelessly clutching at you as an anchor of salvation 
help me to persuade her to write to him and ask for a divorce  
 yes of course  darya alexandrovna said dreamily as she vividly recalled her last interview with alexey alexandrovitch 
 yes of course  she repeated with decision thinking of anna 
 use your influence with her make her write 
i don t like  i m almost unable to speak about this to her  
 very well i will talk to her 
but how is it she does not think of it herself  
said darya alexandrovna and for some reason she suddenly at that point recalled anna s strange new habit of half closing her eyes 
and she remembered that anna drooped her eyelids just when the deeper questions of life were touched upon 
 just as though she half shut her eyes to her own life so as not to see everything  thought dolly 
 yes indeed for my own sake and for hers i will talk to her  dolly said in reply to his look of gratitude 
they got up and walked to the house 
chapter    when anna found dolly at home before her she looked intently in her eyes as though questioning her about the talk she had had with vronsky but she made no inquiry in words 
 i believe it s dinner time  she said 
 we ve not seen each other at all yet 
i am reckoning on the evening 
now i want to go and dress 
i expect you do too we all got splashed at the buildings  
dolly went to her room and she felt amused 
to change her dress was impossible for she had already put on her best dress 
but in order to signify in some way her preparation for dinner she asked the maid to brush her dress changed her cuffs and tie and put some lace on her head 
 this is all i can do  she said with a smile to anna who came in to her in a third dress again of extreme simplicity 
 yes we are too formal here  she said as it were apologizing for her magnificence 
 alexey is delighted at your visit as he rarely is at anything 
he has completely lost his heart to you  she added 
 you re not tired  
there was no time for talking about anything before dinner 
going into the drawing room they found princess varvara already there and the gentlemen of the party in black frock coats 
the architect wore a swallow tail coat 
vronsky presented the doctor and the steward to his guest 
the architect he had already introduced to her at the hospital 
a stout butler resplendent with a smoothly shaven round chin and a starched white cravat announced that dinner was ready and the ladies got up 
vronsky asked sviazhsky to take in anna arkadyevna and himself offered his arm to dolly 
veslovsky was before tushkevitch in offering his arm to princess varvara so that tushkevitch with the steward and the doctor walked in alone 
the dinner the dining room the service the waiting at table the wine and the food were not simply in keeping with the general tone of modern luxury throughout all the house but seemed even more sumptuous and modern 
darya alexandrovna watched this luxury which was novel to her and as a good housekeeper used to managing a household  although she never dreamed of adapting anything she saw to her own household as it was all in a style of luxury far above her own manner of living  she could not help scrutinizing every detail and wondering how and by whom it was all done 
vassenka veslovsky her husband and even sviazhsky and many other people she knew would never have considered this question and would have readily believed what every well bred host tries to make his guests feel that is that all that is well ordered in his house has cost him the host no trouble whatever but comes of itself 
darya alexandrovna was well aware that even porridge for the children s breakfast does not come of itself and that therefore where so complicated and magnificent a style of luxury was maintained someone must give earnest attention to its organization 
and from the glance with which alexey kirillovitch scanned the table from the way he nodded to the butler and offered darya alexandrovna her choice between cold soup and hot soup she saw that it was all organized and maintained by the care of the master of the house himself 
it was evident that it all rested no more upon anna than upon veslovsky 
she sviazhsky the princess and veslovsky were equally guests with light hearts enjoying what had been arranged for them 
anna was the hostess only in conducting the conversation 
the conversation was a difficult one for the lady of the house at a small table with persons present like the steward and the architect belonging to a completely different world struggling not to be overawed by an elegance to which they were unaccustomed and unable to sustain a large share in the general conversation 
but this difficult conversation anna directed with her usual tact and naturalness and indeed she did so with actual enjoyment as darya alexandrovna observed 
the conversation began about the row tushkevitch and veslovsky had taken alone together in the boat and tushkevitch began describing the last boat races in petersburg at the yacht club 
but anna seizing the first pause at once turned to the architect to draw him out of his silence 
 nikolay ivanitch was struck  she said meaning sviazhsky at the progress the new building had made since he was here last but i am there every day and every day i wonder at the rate at which it grows  
 it s first rate working with his excellency  said the architect with a smile he was respectful and composed though with a sense of his own dignity  
 it s a very different matter to have to do with the district authorities 
where one would have to write out sheaves of papers here i call upon the count and in three words we settle the business  
 the american way of doing business  said sviazhsky with a smile 
 yes there they build in a rational fashion     the conversation passed to the misuse of political power in the united states but anna quickly brought it round to another topic so as to draw the steward into talk 
 have you ever seen a reaping machine  
she said addressing darya alexandrovna 
 we had just ridden over to look at one when we met 
it s the first time i ever saw one  
 how do they work  
asked dolly 
 exactly like little scissors 
a plank and a lot of little scissors 
like this  
anna took a knife and fork in her beautiful white hands covered with rings and began showing how the machine worked 
it was clear that she saw nothing would be understood from her explanation but aware that her talk was pleasant and her hands beautiful she went on explaining 
 more like little penknives  veslovsky said playfully never taking his eyes off her 
anna gave a just perceptible smile but made no answer 
 isn t it true karl fedoritch that it s just like little scissors  
she said to the steward  
oh ja  answered the german 
 es it ein ganz einfaches ding   and he began to explain the construction of the machine 
 it s a pity it doesn t bind too 
i saw one at the vienna exhibition which binds with a wire  said sviazhsky 
 they would be more profitable in use  
 es kommt drauf an     der preis vom draht muss ausgerechnet werden  
and the german roused from his taciturnity turned to vronsky 
 das lässt sich ausrechnen erlaucht  
the german was just feeling in the pocket where were his pencil and the notebook he always wrote in but recollecting that he was at a dinner and observing vronsky s chilly glance he checked himself 
 zu compliziert macht zu viel klopot   he concluded 
 wünscht man dochots so hat man auch klopots   said vassenka veslovsky mimicking the german 
 j adore l allemand   he addressed anna again with the same smile 
 cessez   she said with playful severity 
 we expected to find you in the fields vassily semyonitch  she said to the doctor a sickly looking man have you been there  
 i went there but i had taken flight  the doctor answered with gloomy jocoseness 
 then you ve taken a good constitutional  
 splendid  
 well and how was the old woman 
i hope it s not typhus  
 typhus it is not but it s taking a bad turn  
 what a pity  
said anna and having thus paid the dues of civility to her domestic circle she turned to her own friends 
 it would be a hard task though to construct a machine from your description anna arkadyevna  sviazhsky said jestingly 
 oh no why so  
said anna with a smile that betrayed that she knew there was something charming in her disquisitions upon the machine that had been noticed by sviazhsky 
this new trait of girlish coquettishness made an unpleasant impression on dolly 
 but anna arkadyevna s knowledge of architecture is marvelous  said tushkevitch 
 to be sure i heard anna arkadyevna talking yesterday about plinths and damp courses  said veslovsky 
 have i got it right  
 there s nothing marvelous about it when one sees and hears so much of it  said anna 
 but i dare say you don t even know what houses are made of  
darya alexandrovna saw that anna disliked the tone of raillery that existed between her and veslovsky but fell in with it against her will 
vronsky acted in this matter quite differently from levin 
he obviously attached no significance to veslovsky s chattering on the contrary he encouraged his jests 
 come now tell us veslovsky how are the stones held together  
 by cement of course  
 bravo 
and what is cement  
 oh some sort of paste   no putty  said veslovsky raising a general laugh 
the company at dinner with the exception of the doctor the architect and the steward who remained plunged in gloomy silence kept up a conversation that never paused glancing off one subject fastening on another and at times stinging one or the other to the quick 
once darya alexandrovna felt wounded to the quick and got so hot that she positively flushed and wondered afterwards whether she had said anything extreme or unpleasant 
sviazhsky began talking of levin describing his strange view that machinery is simply pernicious in its effects on russian agriculture 
 i have not the pleasure of knowing this m levin  vronsky said smiling but most likely he has never seen the machines he condemns or if he has seen and tried any it must have been after a queer fashion some russian imitation not a machine from abroad 
what sort of views can anyone have on such a subject  
 turkish views in general  veslovsky said turning to anna with a smile 
 i can t defend his opinions  darya alexandrovna said firing up but i can say that he s a highly cultivated man and if he were here he would know very well how to answer you though i am not capable of doing so  
 i like him extremely and we are great friends  sviazhsky said smiling good naturedly  
mais pardon il est un petit peu toqué  he maintains for instance that district councils and arbitration boards are all of no use and he is unwilling to take part in anything  
 it s our russian apathy  said vronsky pouring water from an iced decanter into a delicate glass on a high stem we ve no sense of the duties our privileges impose upon us and so we refuse to recognize these duties  
 i know no man more strict in the performance of his duties  said darya alexandrovna irritated by vronsky s tone of superiority 
 for my part  pursued vronsky who was evidently for some reason or other keenly affected by this conversation such as i am i am on the contrary extremely grateful for the honor they have done me thanks to nikolay ivanitch he indicated sviazhsky  in electing me a justice of the peace 
i consider that for me the duty of being present at the session of judging some peasants quarrel about a horse is as important as anything i can do 
and i shall regard it as an honor if they elect me for the district council 
it s only in that way i can pay for the advantages i enjoy as a landowner 
unluckily they don t understand the weight that the big landowners ought to have in the state  
it was strange to darya alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident he was of being right at his own table 
she thought how levin who believed the opposite was just as positive in his opinions at his own table 
but she loved levin and so she was on his side 
 so we can reckon upon you count for the coming elections  
said sviazhsky 
 but you must come a little beforehand so as to be on the spot by the eighth 
if you would do me the honor to stop with me  
 i rather agree with your beau frère  said anna though not quite on the same ground as he  she added with a smile 
 i m afraid that we have too many of these public duties in these latter days 
just as in old days there were so many government functionaries that one had to call in a functionary for every single thing so now everyone s doing some sort of public duty 
alexey has been here now six months and he s a member i do believe of five or six different public bodies 
du train que cela va  the whole time will be wasted on it 
and i m afraid that with such a multiplicity of these bodies they ll end in being a mere form 
how many are you a member of nikolay ivanitch  
she turned to sviazhsky   over twenty i fancy  
anna spoke lightly but irritation could be discerned in her tone 
darya alexandrovna watching anna and vronsky attentively detected it instantly 
she noticed too that as she spoke vronsky s face had immediately taken a serious and obstinate expression 
noticing this and that princess varvara at once made haste to change the conversation by talking of petersburg acquaintances and remembering what vronsky had without apparent connection said in the garden of his work in the country dolly surmised that this question of public activity was connected with some deep private disagreement between anna and vronsky 
the dinner the wine the decoration of the table were all very good but it was all like what darya alexandrovna had seen at formal dinners and balls which of late years had become quite unfamiliar to her it all had the same impersonal and constrained character and so on an ordinary day and in a little circle of friends it made a disagreeable impression on her 
after dinner they sat on the terrace then they proceeded to play lawn tennis 
the players divided into two parties stood on opposite sides of a tightly drawn net with gilt poles on the carefully leveled and rolled croquet ground 
darya alexandrovna made an attempt to play but it was a long time before she could understand the game and by the time she did understand it she was so tired that she sat down with princess varvara and simply looked on at the players 
her partner tushkevitch gave up playing too but the others kept the game up for a long time 
sviazhsky and vronsky both played very well and seriously 
they kept a sharp lookout on the balls served to them and without haste or getting in each other s way they ran adroitly up to them waited for the rebound and neatly and accurately returned them over the net 
veslovsky played worse than the others 
he was too eager but he kept the players lively with his high spirits 
his laughter and outcries never paused 
like the other men of the party with the ladies permission he took off his coat and his solid comely figure in his white shirt sleeves with his red perspiring face and his impulsive movements made a picture that imprinted itself vividly on the memory 
when darya alexandrovna lay in bed that night as soon as she closed her eyes she saw vassenka veslovsky flying about the croquet ground 
during the game darya alexandrovna was not enjoying herself 
she did not like the light tone of raillery that was kept up all the time between vassenka veslovsky and anna and the unnaturalness altogether of grown up people all alone without children playing at a child s game 
but to avoid breaking up the party and to get through the time somehow after a rest she joined the game again and pretended to be enjoying it 
all that day it seemed to her as though she were acting in a theater with actors cleverer than she and that her bad acting was spoiling the whole performance 
she had come with the intention of staying two days if all went well 
but in the evening during the game she made up her mind that she would go home next day 
the maternal cares and worries which she had so hated on the way now after a day spent without them struck her in quite another light and tempted her back to them 
when after evening tea and a row by night in the boat darya alexandrovna went alone to her room took off her dress and began arranging her thin hair for the night she had a great sense of relief 
it was positively disagreeable to her to think that anna was coming to see her immediately 
she longed to be alone with her own thoughts 
chapter    dolly was wanting to go to bed when anna came in to see her attired for the night 
in the course of the day anna had several times begun to speak of matters near her heart and every time after a few words she had stopped afterwards by ourselves we ll talk about everything 
i ve got so much i want to tell you  she said 
now they were by themselves and anna did not know what to talk about 
she sat in the window looking at dolly and going over in her own mind all the stores of intimate talk which had seemed so inexhaustible beforehand and she found nothing 
at that moment it seemed to her that everything had been said already 
 well what of kitty  
she said with a heavy sigh looking penitently at dolly 
 tell me the truth dolly isn t she angry with me  
 angry 
oh no  
said darya alexandrovna smiling 
 but she hates me despises me  
 oh no 
but you know that sort of thing isn t forgiven  
 yes yes  said anna turning away and looking out of the open window 
 but i was not to blame 
and who is to blame 
what s the meaning of being to blame 
could it have been otherwise 
what do you think 
could it possibly have happened that you didn t become the wife of stiva  
 really i don t know 
but this is what i want you to tell me     yes yes but we ve not finished about kitty 
is she happy 
he s a very nice man they say  
 he s much more than very nice 
i don t know a better man  
 ah how glad i am 
i m so glad 
much more than very nice  she repeated 
dolly smiled 
 but tell me about yourself 
we ve a great deal to talk about 
and i ve had a talk with    dolly did not know what to call him 
she felt it awkward to call him either the count or alexey kirillovitch 
 with alexey  said anna i know what you talked about 
but i wanted to ask you directly what you think of me of my life  
 how am i to say like that straight off 
i really don t know  
 no tell me all the same     you see my life 
but you mustn t forget that you re seeing us in the summer when you have come to us and we are not alone    
but we came here early in the spring lived quite alone and shall be alone again and i desire nothing better 
but imagine me living alone without him alone and that will be   i see by everything that it will often be repeated that he will be half the time away from home  she said getting up and sitting down close by dolly 
 of course  she interrupted dolly who would have answered of course i won t try to keep him by force 
i don t keep him indeed 
the races are just coming his horses are running he will go 
i m very glad 
but think of me fancy my position    
but what s the use of talking about it  
she smiled 
 well what did he talk about with you  
 he spoke of what i want to speak about of myself and it s easy for me to be his advocate of whether there is not a possibility   whether you could not    darya alexandrovna hesitated correct improve your position     you know how i look at it    
but all the same if possible you should get married      divorce you mean  
said anna 
 do you know the only woman who came to see me in petersburg was betsy tverskaya 
you know her of course 
au fond c est la femme la plus depraveé qui existe 
she had an intrigue with tushkevitch deceiving her husband in the basest way 
and she told me that she did not care to know me so long as my position was irregular 
don t imagine i would compare   i know you darling 
but i could not help remembering     well so what did he say to you  
she repeated 
 he said that he was unhappy on your account and his own 
perhaps you will say that it s egoism but what a legitimate and noble egoism 
he wants first of all to legitimize his daughter and to be your husband to have a legal right to you  
 what wife what slave can be so utterly a slave as i in my position  
she put in gloomily 
 the chief thing he desires   he desires that you should not suffer  
 that s impossible 
well  
 well and the most legitimate desire  he wishes that your children should have a name  
 what children  
anna said not looking at dolly and half closing her eyes 
 annie and those to come     he need not trouble on that score i shall have no more children  
 how can you tell that you won t  
 i shall not because i don t wish it  
and in spite of all her emotion anna smiled as she caught the naïve expression of curiosity wonder and horror on dolly s face 
 the doctor told me after my illness     impossible  
said dolly opening her eyes wide 
for her this was one of those discoveries the consequences and deductions from which are so immense that all that one feels for the first instant is that it is impossible to take it all in and that one will have to reflect a great great deal upon it 
this discovery suddenly throwing light on all those families of one or two children which had hitherto been so incomprehensible to her aroused so many ideas reflections and contradictory emotions that she had nothing to say and simply gazed with wide open eyes of wonder at anna 
this was the very thing she had been dreaming of but now learning that it was possible she was horrified 
she felt that it was too simple a solution of too complicated a problem 
 n est ce pas immoral  
was all she said after a brief pause 
 why so 
think i have a choice between two alternatives either to be with child that is an invalid or to be the friend and companion of my husband  practically my husband  anna said in a tone intentionally superficial and frivolous 
 yes yes  said darya alexandrovna hearing the very arguments she had used to herself and not finding the same force in them as before 
 for you for other people  said anna as though divining her thoughts there may be reason to hesitate but for me     you must consider i am not his wife he loves me as long as he loves me 
and how am i to keep his love 
not like this  
she moved her white hands in a curve before her waist with extraordinary rapidity as happens during moments of excitement ideas and memories rushed into darya alexandrovna s head 
 i  she thought did not keep my attraction for stiva he left me for others and the first woman for whom he betrayed me did not keep him by being always pretty and lively 
he deserted her and took another 
and can anna attract and keep count vronsky in that way 
if that is what he looks for he will find dresses and manners still more attractive and charming 
and however white and beautiful her bare arms are however beautiful her full figure and her eager face under her black curls he will find something better still just as my disgusting pitiful and charming husband does  
dolly made no answer she merely sighed 
anna noticed this sigh indicating dissent and she went on 
in her armory she had other arguments so strong that no answer could be made to them 
 do you say that it s not right 
but you must consider  she went on you forget my position 
how can i desire children 
i m not speaking of the suffering i m not afraid of that 
think only what are my children to be 
ill fated children who will have to bear a stranger s name 
for the very fact of their birth they will be forced to be ashamed of their mother their father their birth  
 but that is just why a divorce is necessary  
but anna did not hear her 
she longed to give utterance to all the arguments with which she had so many times convinced herself 
 what is reason given me for if i am not to use it to avoid bringing unhappy beings into the world  
she looked at dolly but without waiting for a reply she went on  i should always feel i had wronged these unhappy children  she said 
 if they are not at any rate they are not unhappy while if they are unhappy i alone should be to blame for it  
these were the very arguments darya alexandrovna had used in her own reflections but she heard them without understanding them 
 how can one wrong creatures that don t exist  
she thought 
and all at once the idea struck her could it possibly under any circumstances have been better for her favorite grisha if he had never existed 
and this seemed to her so wild so strange that she shook her head to drive away this tangle of whirling mad ideas 
 no i don t know it s not right  was all she said with an expression of disgust on her face 
 yes but you mustn t forget that you and i     and besides that  added anna in spite of the wealth of her arguments and the poverty of dolly s objections seeming still to admit that it was not right don t forget the chief point that i am not now in the same position as you 
for you the question is  do you desire not to have any more children while for me it is do i desire to have them 
and that s a great difference 
you must see that i can t desire it in my position  
darya alexandrovna made no reply 
she suddenly felt that she had got far away from anna that there lay between them a barrier of questions on which they could never agree and about which it was better not to speak 
chapter    then there is all the more reason for you to legalize your position if possible  said dolly 
 yes if possible  said anna speaking all at once in an utterly different tone subdued and mournful 
 surely you don t mean a divorce is impossible 
i was told your husband had consented to it  
 dolly i don t want to talk about that  
 oh we won t then  darya alexandrovna hastened to say noticing the expression of suffering on anna s face 
 all i see is that you take too gloomy a view of things  
 i 
not at all 
i m always bright and happy 
you see  je fais des passions 
veslovsky     yes to tell the truth i don t like veslovsky s tone  said darya alexandrovna anxious to change the subject 
 oh that s nonsense 
it amuses alexey and that s all but he s a boy and quite under my control 
you know i turn him as i please 
it s just as it might be with your grisha    
dolly  
  she suddenly changed the subject   you say i take too gloomy a view of things 
you can t understand 
it s too awful 
i try not to take any view of it at all  
 but i think you ought to 
you ought to do all you can  
 but what can i do 
nothing 
you tell me to marry alexey and say i don t think about it 
i don t think about it  
she repeated and a flush rose into her face 
she got up straightening her chest and sighed heavily 
with her light step she began pacing up and down the room stopping now and then 
 i don t think of it 
not a day not an hour passes that i don t think of it and blame myself for thinking of it   because thinking of that may drive me mad 
drive me mad  
she repeated 
 when i think of it i can t sleep without morphine 
but never mind 
let us talk quietly 
they tell me divorce 
in the first place he won t give me a divorce 
he s under the influence of countess lidia ivanovna now  
darya alexandrovna sitting erect on a chair turned her head following anna with a face of sympathetic suffering 
 you ought to make the attempt  she said softly 
 suppose i make the attempt 
what does it mean  
she said evidently giving utterance to a thought a thousand times thought over and learned by heart 
 it means that i hating him but still recognizing that i have wronged him  and i consider him magnanimous  that i humiliate myself to write to him     well suppose i make the effort i do it 
either i receive a humiliating refusal or consent     well i have received his consent say    anna was at that moment at the furthest end of the room and she stopped there doing something to the curtain at the window 
 i receive his consent but my   my son 
they won t give him up to me 
he will grow up despising me with his father whom i ve abandoned 
do you see i love   equally i think but both more than myself  two creatures seryozha and alexey  
she came out into the middle of the room and stood facing dolly with her arms pressed tightly across her chest 
in her white dressing gown her figure seemed more than usually grand and broad 
she bent her head and with shining wet eyes looked from under her brows at dolly a thin little pitiful figure in her patched dressing jacket and nightcap shaking all over with emotion 
 it is only those two creatures that i love and one excludes the other 
i can t have them together and that s the only thing i want 
and since i can t have that i don t care about the rest 
i don t care about anything anything 
and it will end one way or another and so i can t i don t like to talk of it 
so don t blame me don t judge me for anything 
you can t with your pure heart understand all that i m suffering  
she went up sat down beside dolly and with a guilty look peeped into her face and took her hand 
 what are you thinking 
what are you thinking about me 
don t despise me 
i don t deserve contempt 
i m simply unhappy 
if anyone is unhappy i am  she articulated and turning away she burst into tears 
left alone darya alexandrovna said her prayers and went to bed 
she had felt for anna with all her heart while she was speaking to her but now she could not force herself to think of her 
the memories of home and of her children rose up in her imagination with a peculiar charm quite new to her with a sort of new brilliance 
that world of her own seemed to her now so sweet and precious that she would not on any account spend an extra day outside it and she made up her mind that she would certainly go back next day 
anna meantime went back to her boudoir took a wine glass and dropped into it several drops of a medicine of which the principal ingredient was morphine 
after drinking it off and sitting still a little while she went into her bedroom in a soothed and more cheerful frame of mind 
when she went into the bedroom vronsky looked intently at her 
he was looking for traces of the conversation which he knew that staying so long in dolly s room she must have had with her 
but in her expression of restrained excitement and of a sort of reserve he could find nothing but the beauty that always bewitched him afresh though he was used to it the consciousness of it and the desire that it should affect him 
he did not want to ask her what they had been talking of but he hoped that she would tell him something of her own accord 
but she only said  i am so glad you like dolly 
you do don t you  
 oh i ve known her a long while you know 
she s very good hearted i suppose  mais excessivement terre à terre 
still i m very glad to see her  
he took anna s hand and looked inquiringly into her eyes 
misinterpreting the look she smiled to him 
next morning in spite of the protests of her hosts darya alexandrovna prepared for her homeward journey 
levin s coachman in his by no means new coat and shabby hat with his ill matched horses and his coach with the patched mud guards drove with gloomy determination into the covered gravel approach 
darya alexandrovna disliked taking leave of princess varvara and the gentlemen of the party 
after a day spent together both she and her hosts were distinctly aware that they did not get on together and that it was better for them not to meet 
only anna was sad 
she knew that now from dolly s departure no one again would stir up within her soul the feelings that had been roused by their conversation 
it hurt her to stir up these feelings but yet she knew that that was the best part of her soul and that that part of her soul would quickly be smothered in the life she was leading 
as she drove out into the open country darya alexandrovna had a delightful sense of relief and she felt tempted to ask the two men how they had liked being at vronsky s when suddenly the coachman philip expressed himself unasked  rolling in wealth they may be but three pots of oats was all they gave us 
everything cleared up till there wasn t a grain left by cockcrow 
what are three pots 
a mere mouthful 
and oats now down to forty five kopecks 
at our place no fear all comers may have as much as they can eat  
 the master s a screw  put in the counting house clerk 
 well did you like their horses  
asked dolly 
 the horses   there s no two opinions about them 
and the food was good 
but it seemed to me sort of dreary there darya alexandrovna 
i don t know what you thought  he said turning his handsome good natured face to her 
 i thought so too 
well shall we get home by evening  
 eh we must  
on reaching home and finding everyone entirely satisfactory and particularly charming darya alexandrovna began with great liveliness telling them how she had arrived how warmly they had received her of the luxury and good taste in which the vronskys lived and of their recreations and she would not allow a word to be said against them 
 one has to know anna and vronsky  i have got to know him better now  to see how nice they are and how touching  she said speaking now with perfect sincerity and forgetting the vague feeling of dissatisfaction and awkwardness she had experienced there 
chapter    vronsky and anna spent the whole summer and part of the winter in the country living in just the same condition and still taking no steps to obtain a divorce 
it was an understood thing between them that they should not go away anywhere but both felt the longer they lived alone especially in the autumn without guests in the house that they could not stand this existence and that they would have to alter it 
their life was apparently such that nothing better could be desired 
they had the fullest abundance of everything they had a child and both had occupation 
anna devoted just as much care to her appearance when they had no visitors and she did a great deal of reading both of novels and of what serious literature was in fashion 
she ordered all the books that were praised in the foreign papers and reviews she received and read them with that concentrated attention which is only given to what is read in seclusion 
moreover every subject that was of interest to vronsky she studied in books and special journals so that he often went straight to her with questions relating to agriculture or architecture sometimes even with questions relating to horse breeding or sport 
he was amazed at her knowledge her memory and at first was disposed to doubt it to ask for confirmation of her facts and she would find what he asked for in some book and show it to him 
the building of the hospital too interested her 
she did not merely assist but planned and suggested a great deal herself 
but her chief thought was still of herself  how far she was dear to vronsky how far she could make up to him for all he had given up 
vronsky appreciated this desire not only to please but to serve him which had become the sole aim of her existence but at the same time he wearied of the loving snares in which she tried to hold him fast 
as time went on and he saw himself more and more often held fast in these snares he had an ever growing desire not so much to escape from them as to try whether they hindered his freedom 
had it not been for this growing desire to be free not to have scenes every time he wanted to go to the town to a meeting or a race vronsky would have been perfectly satisfied with his life 
the rôle he had taken up the rôle of a wealthy landowner one of that class which ought to be the very heart of the russian aristocracy was entirely to his taste and now after spending six months in that character he derived even greater satisfaction from it 
and his management of his estate which occupied and absorbed him more and more was most successful 
in spite of the immense sums cost him by the hospital by machinery by cows ordered from switzerland and many other things he was convinced that he was not wasting but increasing his substance 
in all matters affecting income the sales of timber wheat and wool the letting of lands vronsky was hard as a rock and knew well how to keep up prices 
in all operations on a large scale on this and his other estates he kept to the simplest methods involving no risk and in trifling details he was careful and exacting to an extreme degree 
in spite of all the cunning and ingenuity of the german steward who would try to tempt him into purchases by making his original estimate always far larger than really required and then representing to vronsky that he might get the thing cheaper and so make a profit vronsky did not give in 
he listened to his steward cross examined him and only agreed to his suggestions when the implement to be ordered or constructed was the very newest not yet known in russia and likely to excite wonder 
apart from such exceptions he resolved upon an increased outlay only where there was a surplus and in making such an outlay he went into the minutest details and insisted on getting the very best for his money so that by the method on which he managed his affairs it was clear that he was not wasting but increasing his substance 
in october there were the provincial elections in the kashinsky province where were the estates of vronsky sviazhsky koznishev oblonsky and a small part of levin s land 
these elections were attracting public attention from several circumstances connected with them and also from the people taking part in them 
there had been a great deal of talk about them and great preparations were being made for them 
persons who never attended the elections were coming from moscow from petersburg and from abroad to attend these 
vronsky had long before promised sviazhsky to go to them 
before the elections sviazhsky who often visited vozdvizhenskoe drove over to fetch vronsky 
on the day before there had been almost a quarrel between vronsky and anna over this proposed expedition 
it was the very dullest autumn weather which is so dreary in the country and so preparing himself for a struggle vronsky with a hard and cold expression informed anna of his departure as he had never spoken to her before 
but to his surprise anna accepted the information with great composure and merely asked when he would be back 
he looked intently at her at a loss to explain this composure 
she smiled at his look 
he knew that way she had of withdrawing into herself and knew that it only happened when she had determined upon something without letting him know her plans 
he was afraid of this but he was so anxious to avoid a scene that he kept up appearances and half sincerely believed in what he longed to believe in  her reasonableness 
 i hope you won t be dull  
 i hope not  said anna 
 i got a box of books yesterday from gautier s 
no i shan t be dull  
 she s trying to take that tone and so much the better  he thought or else it would be the same thing over and over again  
and he set off for the elections without appealing to her for a candid explanation 
it was the first time since the beginning of their intimacy that he had parted from her without a full explanation 
from one point of view this troubled him but on the other side he felt that it was better so 
 at first there will be as this time something undefined kept back and then she will get used to it 
in any case i can give up anything for her but not my masculine independence  he thought 
chapter    in september levin moved to moscow for kitty s confinement 
he had spent a whole month in moscow with nothing to do when sergey ivanovitch who had property in the kashinsky province and took great interest in the question of the approaching elections made ready to set off to the elections 
he invited his brother who had a vote in the seleznevsky district to come with him 
levin had moreover to transact in kashin some extremely important business relating to the wardship of land and to the receiving of certain redemption money for his sister who was abroad 
levin still hesitated but kitty who saw that he was bored in moscow and urged him to go on her own authority ordered him the proper nobleman s uniform costing seven pounds 
and that seven pounds paid for the uniform was the chief cause that finally decided levin to go 
he went to kashin     levin had been six days in kashin visiting the assembly each day and busily engaged about his sister s business which still dragged on 
the district marshals of nobility were all occupied with the elections and it was impossible to get the simplest thing done that depended upon the court of wardship 
the other matter the payment of the sums due was met too by difficulties 
after long negotiations over the legal details the money was at last ready to be paid but the notary a most obliging person could not hand over the order because it must have the signature of the president and the president though he had not given over his duties to a deputy was at the elections 
all these worrying negotiations this endless going from place to place and talking with pleasant and excellent people who quite saw the unpleasantness of the petitioner s position but were powerless to assist him  all these efforts that yielded no result led to a feeling of misery in levin akin to the mortifying helplessness one experiences in dreams when one tries to use physical force 
he felt this frequently as he talked to his most good natured solicitor 
this solicitor did it seemed everything possible and strained every nerve to get him out of his difficulties 
 i tell you what you might try  he said more than once go to so and so and so and so  and the solicitor drew up a regular plan for getting round the fatal point that hindered everything 
but he would add immediately it ll mean some delay anyway but you might try it  
and levin did try and did go 
everyone was kind and civil but the point evaded seemed to crop up again in the end and again to bar the way 
what was particularly trying was that levin could not make out with whom he was struggling to whose interest it was that his business should not be done 
that no one seemed to know the solicitor certainly did not know 
if levin could have understood why just as he saw why one can only approach the booking office of a railway station in single file it would not have been so vexatious and tiresome to him 
but with the hindrances that confronted him in his business no one could explain why they existed 
but levin had changed a good deal since his marriage he was patient and if he could not see why it was all arranged like this he told himself that he could not judge without knowing all about it and that most likely it must be so and he tried not to fret 
in attending the elections too and taking part in them he tried now not to judge not to fall foul of them but to comprehend as fully as he could the question which was so earnestly and ardently absorbing honest and excellent men whom he respected 
since his marriage there had been revealed to levin so many new and serious aspects of life that had previously through his frivolous attitude to them seemed of no importance that in the question of the elections too he assumed and tried to find some serious significance 
sergey ivanovitch explained to him the meaning and object of the proposed revolution at the elections 
the marshal of the province in whose hands the law had placed the control of so many important public functions  the guardianship of wards the very department which was giving levin so much trouble just now  the disposal of large sums subscribed by the nobility of the province the high schools female male and military and popular instruction on the new model and finally the district council  the marshal of the province snetkov was a nobleman of the old school   dissipating an immense fortune a good hearted man honest after his own fashion but utterly without any comprehension of the needs of modern days 
he always took in every question the side of the nobility he was positively antagonistic to the spread of popular education and he succeeded in giving a purely party character to the district council which ought by rights to be of such an immense importance 
what was needed was to put in his place a fresh capable perfectly modern man of contemporary ideas and to frame their policy so as from the rights conferred upon the nobles not as the nobility but as an element of the district council to extract all the powers of self government that could possibly be derived from them 
in the wealthy kashinsky province which always took the lead of other provinces in everything there was now such a preponderance of forces that this policy once carried through properly there might serve as a model for other provinces for all russia 
and hence the whole question was of the greatest importance 
it was proposed to elect as marshal in place of snetkov either sviazhsky or better still nevyedovsky a former university professor a man of remarkable intelligence and a great friend of sergey ivanovitch 
the meeting was opened by the governor who made a speech to the nobles urging them to elect the public functionaries not from regard for persons but for the service and welfare of their fatherland and hoping that the honorable nobility of the kashinsky province would as at all former elections hold their duty as sacred and vindicate the exalted confidence of the monarch 
when he had finished with his speech the governor walked out of the hall and the noblemen noisily and eagerly  some even enthusiastically  followed him and thronged round him while he put on his fur coat and conversed amicably with the marshal of the province 
levin anxious to see into everything and not to miss anything stood there too in the crowd and heard the governor say please tell marya ivanovna my wife is very sorry she couldn t come to the home  
and thereupon the nobles in high good humor sorted out their fur coats and all drove off to the cathedral 
in the cathedral levin lifting his hand like the rest and repeating the words of the archdeacon swore with most terrible oaths to do all the governor had hoped they would do 
church services always affected levin and as he uttered the words i kiss the cross  and glanced round at the crowd of young and old men repeating the same he felt touched 
on the second and third days there was business relating to the finances of the nobility and the female high school of no importance whatever as sergey ivanovitch explained and levin busy seeing after his own affairs did not attend the meetings 
on the fourth day the auditing of the marshal s accounts took place at the high table of the marshal of the province 
and then there occurred the first skirmish between the new party and the old 
the committee who had been deputed to verify the accounts reported to the meeting that all was in order 
the marshal of the province got up thanked the nobility for their confidence and shed tears 
the nobles gave him a loud welcome and shook hands with him 
but at that instant a nobleman of sergey ivanovitch s party said that he had heard that the committee had not verified the accounts considering such a verification an insult to the marshal of the province 
one of the members of the committee incautiously admitted this 
then a small gentleman very young looking but very malignant began to say that it would probably be agreeable to the marshal of the province to give an account of his expenditures of the public moneys and that the misplaced delicacy of the members of the committee was depriving him of this moral satisfaction 
then the members of the committee tried to withdraw their admission and sergey ivanovitch began to prove that they must logically admit either that they had verified the accounts or that they had not and he developed this dilemma in detail 
sergey ivanovitch was answered by the spokesman of the opposite party 
then sviazhsky spoke and then the malignant gentleman again 
the discussion lasted a long time and ended in nothing 
levin was surprised that they should dispute upon this subject so long especially as when he asked sergey ivanovitch whether he supposed that money had been misappropriated sergey ivanovitch answered  oh no 
he s an honest man 
but those old fashioned methods of paternal family arrangements in the management of provincial affairs must be broken down  
on the fifth day came the elections of the district marshals 
it was rather a stormy day in several districts 
in the seleznevsky district sviazhsky was elected unanimously without a ballot and he gave a dinner that evening 
chapter    the sixth day was fixed for the election of the marshal of the province 
the rooms large and small were full of noblemen in all sorts of uniforms 
many had come only for that day 
men who had not seen each other for years some from the crimea some from petersburg some from abroad met in the rooms of the hall of nobility 
there was much discussion around the governor s table under the portrait of the tsar 
the nobles both in the larger and the smaller rooms grouped themselves in camps and from their hostile and suspicious glances from the silence that fell upon them when outsiders approached a group and from the way that some whispering together retreated to the farther corridor it was evident that each side had secrets from the other 
in appearance the noblemen were sharply divided into two classes the old and the new 
the old were for the most part either in old uniforms of the nobility buttoned up closely with spurs and hats or in their own special naval cavalry infantry or official uniforms 
the uniforms of the older men were embroidered in the old fashioned way with epaulets on their shoulders they were unmistakably tight and short in the waist as though their wearers had grown out of them 
the younger men wore the uniform of the nobility with long waists and broad shoulders unbuttoned over white waistcoats or uniforms with black collars and with the embroidered badges of justices of the peace 
to the younger men belonged the court uniforms that here and there brightened up the crowd 
but the division into young and old did not correspond with the division of parties 
some of the young men as levin observed belonged to the old party and some of the very oldest noblemen on the contrary were whispering with sviazhsky and were evidently ardent partisans of the new party 
levin stood in the smaller room where they were smoking and taking light refreshments close to his own friends and listening to what they were saying he conscientiously exerted all his intelligence trying to understand what was said 
sergey ivanovitch was the center round which the others grouped themselves 
he was listening at that moment to sviazhsky and hliustov the marshal of another district who belonged to their party 
hliustov would not agree to go with his district to ask snetkov to stand while sviazhsky was persuading him to do so and sergey ivanovitch was approving of the plan 
levin could not make out why the opposition was to ask the marshal to stand whom they wanted to supersede 
stepan arkadyevitch who had just been drinking and taking some lunch came up to them in his uniform of a gentleman of the bedchamber wiping his lips with a perfumed handkerchief of bordered batiste 
 we are placing our forces  he said pulling out his whiskers sergey ivanovitch  
and listening to the conversation he supported sviazhsky s contention 
 one district s enough and sviazhsky s obviously of the opposition  he said words evidently intelligible to all except levin 
 why kostya you here too 
i suppose you re converted eh  
he added turning to levin and drawing his arm through his 
levin would have been glad indeed to be converted but could not make out what the point was and retreating a few steps from the speakers he explained to stepan arkadyevitch his inability to understand why the marshal of the province should be asked to stand 
 o sancta simplicitas  
said stepan arkadyevitch and briefly and clearly he explained it to levin 
if as at previous elections all the districts asked the marshal of the province to stand then he would be elected without a ballot 
that must not be 
now eight districts had agreed to call upon him if two refused to do so snetkov might decline to stand at all and then the old party might choose another of their party which would throw them completely out in their reckoning 
but if only one district sviazhsky s did not call upon him to stand snetkov would let himself be balloted for 
they were even some of them going to vote for him and purposely to let him get a good many votes so that the enemy might be thrown off the scent and when a candidate of the other side was put up they too might give him some votes 
levin understood to some extent but not fully and would have put a few more questions when suddenly everyone began talking and making a noise and they moved towards the big room 
 what is it 
eh 
whom  
 no guarantee 
whose 
what  
 they won t pass him  
 no guarantee  
 they won t let flerov in  
 eh because of the charge against him  
 why at this rate they won t admit anyone 
it s a swindle  
 the law  
levin heard exclamations on all sides and he moved into the big room together with the others all hurrying somewhere and afraid of missing something 
squeezed by the crowding noblemen he drew near the high table where the marshal of the province sviazhsky and the other leaders were hotly disputing about something 
chapter    levin was standing rather far off 
a nobleman breathing heavily and hoarsely at his side and another whose thick boots were creaking prevented him from hearing distinctly 
he could only hear the soft voice of the marshal faintly then the shrill voice of the malignant gentleman and then the voice of sviazhsky 
they were disputing as far as he could make out as to the interpretation to be put on the act and the exact meaning of the words liable to be called up for trial  
the crowd parted to make way for sergey ivanovitch approaching the table 
sergey ivanovitch waiting till the malignant gentleman had finished speaking said that he thought the best solution would be to refer to the act itself and asked the secretary to find the act 
the act said that in case of difference of opinion there must be a ballot 
sergey ivanovitch read the act and began to explain its meaning but at that point a tall stout round shouldered landowner with dyed whiskers in a tight uniform that cut the back of his neck interrupted him 
he went up to the table and striking it with his finger ring he shouted loudly a ballot 
put it to the vote 
no need for more talking  
then several voices began to talk all at once and the tall nobleman with the ring getting more and more exasperated shouted more and more loudly 
but it was impossible to make out what he said 
he was shouting for the very course sergey ivanovitch had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it the same vindictiveness though in a more seemly form on the other side 
shouts were raised and for a moment all was confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for order 
 a ballot 
a ballot 
every nobleman sees it 
we shed our blood for our country    
the confidence of the monarch     no checking the accounts of the marshal he s not a cashier    
but that s not the point    
votes please 
beastly     
shouted furious and violent voices on all sides 
looks and faces were even more violent and furious than their words 
they expressed the most implacable hatred 
levin did not in the least understand what was the matter and he marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about flerov should be put to the vote 
he forgot as sergey ivanovitch explained to him afterwards this syllogism that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure flerov s right to vote that to secure the recognition of flerov s right to vote they must decide on the interpretation to be put on the act 
 and one vote may decide the whole question and one must be serious and consecutive if one wants to be of use in public life  concluded sergey ivanovitch 
but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had a respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement 
to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment bar 
seeing the waiters busy over washing up the crockery and setting in order their plates and wine glasses seeing their calm and cheerful faces levin felt an unexpected sense of relief as though he had come out of a stuffy room into the fresh air 
he began walking up and down looking with pleasure at the waiters 
he particularly liked the way one gray whiskered waiter who showed his scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered at by them was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly 
levin was just about to enter into conversation with the old waiter when the secretary of the court of wardship a little old man whose specialty it was to know all the noblemen of the province by name and patronymic drew him away 
 please come konstantin dmitrievitch  he said your brother s looking for you 
they are voting on the legal point  
levin walked into the room received a white ball and followed his brother sergey ivanovitch to the table where sviazhsky was standing with a significant and ironical face holding his beard in his fist and sniffing at it 
sergey ivanovitch put his hand into the box put the ball somewhere and making room for levin stopped 
levin advanced but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much embarrassed he turned to sergey ivanovitch with the question where am i to put it  
he asked this softly at a moment when there was talking going on near so that he had hoped his question would not be overheard 
but the persons speaking paused and his improper question was overheard 
sergey ivanovitch frowned 
 that is a matter for each man s own decision  he said severely 
several people smiled 
levin crimsoned hurriedly thrust his hand under the cloth and put the ball to the right as it was in his right hand 
having put it in he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left hand too and so he thrust it in though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the background 
 a hundred and twenty six for admission 
ninety eight against  
sang out the voice of the secretary who could not pronounce the letter  r 
then there was a laugh a button and two nuts were found in the box 
the nobleman was allowed the right to vote and the new party had conquered 
but the old party did not consider themselves conquered 
levin heard that they were asking snetkov to stand and he saw that a crowd of noblemen was surrounding the marshal who was saying something 
levin went nearer 
in reply snetkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him the affection they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility to whom he had devoted twelve years of service 
several times he repeated the words i have served to the best of my powers with truth and good faith i value your goodness and thank you  and suddenly he stopped short from the tears that choked him and went out of the room 
whether these tears came from a sense of the injustice being done him from his love for the nobility or from the strain of the position he was placed in feeling himself surrounded by enemies his emotion infected the assembly the majority were touched and levin felt a tenderness for snetkov 
in the doorway the marshal of the province jostled against levin 
 beg pardon excuse me please  he said as to a stranger but recognizing levin he smiled timidly 
it seemed to levin that he would have liked to say something but could not speak for emotion 
his face and his whole figure in his uniform with the crosses and white trousers striped with braid as he moved hurriedly along reminded levin of some hunted beast who sees that he is in evil case 
this expression in the marshal s face was particularly touching to levin because only the day before he had been at his house about his trustee business and had seen him in all his grandeur a kind hearted fatherly man 
the big house with the old family furniture the rather dirty far from stylish but respectful footmen unmistakably old house serfs who had stuck to their master the stout good natured wife in a cap with lace and a turkish shawl petting her pretty grandchild her daughter s daughter the young son a sixth form high school boy coming home from school and greeting his father kissing his big hand the genuine cordial words and gestures of the old man  all this had the day before roused an instinctive feeling of respect and sympathy in levin 
this old man was a touching and pathetic figure to levin now and he longed to say something pleasant to him 
 so you re sure to be our marshal again  he said 
 it s not likely  said the marshal looking round with a scared expression 
 i m worn out i m old 
if there are men younger and more deserving than i let them serve  
and the marshal disappeared through a side door 
the most solemn moment was at hand 
they were to proceed immediately to the election 
the leaders of both parties were reckoning white and black on their fingers 
the discussion upon flerov had given the new party not only flerov s vote but had also gained time for them so that they could send to fetch three noblemen who had been rendered unable to take part in the elections by the wiles of the other party 
two noble gentlemen who had a weakness for strong drink had been made drunk by the partisans of snetkov and a third had been robbed of his uniform 
on learning this the new party had made haste during the dispute about flerov to send some of their men in a sledge to clothe the stripped gentleman and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting 
 i ve brought one drenched him with water  said the landowner who had gone on this errand to sviazhsky 
 he s all right 
he ll do  
 not too drunk he won t fall down  
said sviazhsky shaking his head 
 no he s first rate 
if only they don t give him any more here    
i ve told the waiter not to give him anything on any account  
chapter    the narrow room in which they were smoking and taking refreshments was full of noblemen 
the excitement grew more intense and every face betrayed some uneasiness 
the excitement was specially keen for the leaders of each party who knew every detail and had reckoned up every vote 
they were the generals organizing the approaching battle 
the rest like the rank and file before an engagement though they were getting ready for the fight sought for other distractions in the interval 
some were lunching standing at the bar or sitting at the table others were walking up and down the long room smoking cigarettes and talking with friends whom they had not seen for a long while 
levin did not care to eat and he was not smoking he did not want to join his own friends that is sergey ivanovitch stepan arkadyevitch sviazhsky and the rest because vronsky in his equerry s uniform was standing with them in eager conversation 
levin had seen him already at the meeting on the previous day and he had studiously avoided him not caring to greet him 
he went to the window and sat down scanning the groups and listening to what was being said around him 
he felt depressed especially because everyone else was as he saw eager anxious and interested and he alone with an old toothless little man with mumbling lips wearing a naval uniform sitting beside him had no interest in it and nothing to do 
 he s such a blackguard 
i have told him so but it makes no difference 
only think of it 
he couldn t collect it in three years  
he heard vigorously uttered by a round shouldered short country gentleman who had pomaded hair hanging on his embroidered collar and new boots obviously put on for the occasion with heels that tapped energetically as he spoke 
casting a displeased glance at levin this gentleman sharply turned his back 
 yes it s a dirty business there s no denying  a small gentleman assented in a high voice 
next a whole crowd of country gentlemen surrounding a stout general hurriedly came near levin 
these persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard 
 how dare he say i had his breeches stolen 
pawned them for drink i expect 
damn the fellow prince indeed 
he d better not say it the beast  
 but excuse me 
they take their stand on the act  was being said in another group the wife must be registered as noble  
 oh damn your acts 
i speak from my heart 
we re all gentlemen aren t we 
above suspicion  
 shall we go on your excellency  fine champagne 
another group was following a nobleman who was shouting something in a loud voice it was one of the three intoxicated gentlemen 
 i always advised marya semyonovna to let for a fair rent for she can never save a profit  he heard a pleasant voice say 
the speaker was a country gentleman with gray whiskers wearing the regimental uniform of an old general staff officer 
it was the very landowner levin had met at sviazhsky s 
he knew him at once 
the landowner too stared at levin and they exchanged greetings 
 very glad to see you 
to be sure 
i remember you very well 
last year at our district marshal nikolay ivanovitch s  
 well and how is your land doing  
asked levin 
 oh still just the same always at a loss  the landowner answered with a resigned smile but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be 
 and how do you come to be in our province  
he asked 
 come to take part in our  coup d etat 
he said confidently pronouncing the french words with a bad accent 
 all russia s here  gentlemen of the bedchamber and everything short of the ministry  
he pointed to the imposing figure of stepan arkadyevitch in white trousers and his court uniform walking by with a general 
 i ought to own that i don t very well understand the drift of the provincial elections  said levin 
the landowner looked at him 
 why what is there to understand 
there s no meaning in it at all 
it s a decaying institution that goes on running only by the force of inertia 
just look the very uniforms tell you that it s an assembly of justices of the peace permanent members of the court and so on but not of noblemen  
 then why do you come  
asked levin 
 from habit nothing else 
then too one must keep up connections 
it s a moral obligation of a sort 
and then to tell the truth there s one s own interests 
my son in law wants to stand as a permanent member they re not rich people and he must be brought forward 
these gentlemen now what do they come for  
he said pointing to the malignant gentleman who was talking at the high table 
 that s the new generation of nobility  
 new it may be but nobility it isn t 
they re proprietors of a sort but we re the landowners 
as noblemen they re cutting their own throats  
 but you say it s an institution that s served its time  
 that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully 
snetkov now   we may be of use or we may not but we re the growth of a thousand years 
if we re laying out a garden planning one before the house you know and there you ve a tree that s stood for centuries in the very spot     old and gnarled it may be and yet you don t cut down the old fellow to make room for the flowerbeds but lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree 
you won t grow him again in a year  he said cautiously and he immediately changed the conversation 
 well and how is your land doing  
 oh not very well 
i make five per cent  
 yes but you don t reckon your own work 
aren t you worth something too 
i ll tell you my own case 
before i took to seeing after the land i had a salary of three hundred pounds from the service 
now i do more work than i did in the service and like you i get five per cent 
on the land and thank god for that 
but one s work is thrown in for nothing  
 then why do you do it if it s a clear loss  
 oh well one does it 
what would you have 
it s habit and one knows it s how it should be 
and what s more  the landowner went on leaning his elbows on the window and chatting on my son i must tell you has no taste for it 
there s no doubt he ll be a scientific man 
so there ll be no one to keep it up 
and yet one does it 
here this year i ve planted an orchard  
 yes yes  said levin that s perfectly true 
i always feel there s no real balance of gain in my work on the land and yet one does it    
it s a sort of duty one feels to the land  
 but i tell you what  the landowner pursued a neighbor of mine a merchant was at my place 
we walked about the fields and the garden 
 no  said he stepan vassilievitch everything s well looked after but your garden s neglected  
but as a fact it s well kept up 
 to my thinking i d cut down that lime tree 
here you ve thousands of limes and each would make two good bundles of bark 
and nowadays that bark s worth something 
i d cut down the lot   
 and with what he made he d increase his stock or buy some land for a trifle and let it out in lots to the peasants  levin added smiling 
he had evidently more than once come across those commercial calculations 
 and he d make his fortune 
but you and i must thank god if we keep what we ve got and leave it to our children  
 you re married i ve heard  
said the landowner 
 yes  levin answered with proud satisfaction 
 yes it s rather strange  he went on 
 so we live without making anything as though we were ancient vestals set to keep in a fire  
the landowner chuckled under his white mustaches 
 there are some among us too like our friend nikolay ivanovitch or count vronsky that s settled here lately who try to carry on their husbandry as though it were a factory but so far it leads to nothing but making away with capital on it  
 but why is it we don t do like the merchants 
why don t we cut down our parks for timber  
said levin returning to a thought that had struck him 
 why as you said to keep the fire in 
besides that s not work for a nobleman 
and our work as noblemen isn t done here at the elections but yonder each in our corner 
there s a class instinct too of what one ought and oughtn t to do 
there s the peasants too i wonder at them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can 
however bad the land is he ll work it 
without a return too 
at a simple loss  
 just as we do  said levin 
 very very glad to have met you  he added seeing sviazhsky approaching him 
 and here we ve met for the first time since we met at your place  said the landowner to sviazhsky and we ve had a good talk too  
 well have you been attacking the new order of things  
said sviazhsky with a smile 
 that we re bound to do  
 you ve relieved your feelings  
chapter    sviazhsky took levin s arm and went with him to his own friends 
this time there was no avoiding vronsky 
he was standing with stepan arkadyevitch and sergey ivanovitch and looking straight at levin as he drew near 
 delighted 
i believe i ve had the pleasure of meeting you   at princess shtcherbatskaya s  he said giving levin his hand 
 yes i quite remember our meeting  said levin and blushing crimson he turned away immediately and began talking to his brother 
with a slight smile vronsky went on talking to sviazhsky obviously without the slightest inclination to enter into conversation with levin 
but levin as he talked to his brother was continually looking round at vronsky trying to think of something to say to him to gloss over his rudeness 
 what are we waiting for now  
asked levin looking at sviazhsky and vronsky 
 for snetkov 
he has to refuse or to consent to stand  answered sviazhsky 
 well and what has he done consented or not  
 that s the point that he s done neither  said vronsky 
 and if he refuses who will stand then  
asked levin looking at vronsky 
 whoever chooses to  said sviazhsky 
 shall you  
asked levin 
 certainly not i  said sviazhsky looking confused and turning an alarmed glance at the malignant gentleman who was standing beside sergey ivanovitch 
 who then 
nevyedovsky  
said levin feeling he was putting his foot into it 
but this was worse still 
nevyedovsky and sviazhsky were the two candidates 
 i certainly shall not under any circumstances  answered the malignant gentleman 
this was nevyedovsky himself 
sviazhsky introduced him to levin 
 well you find it exciting too  
said stepan arkadyevitch winking at vronsky 
 it s something like a race 
one might bet on it  
 yes it is keenly exciting  said vronsky 
 and once taking the thing up one s eager to see it through 
it s a fight  
he said scowling and setting his powerful jaws 
 what a capable fellow sviazhsky is 
sees it all so clearly  
 oh yes  
vronsky assented indifferently 
a silence followed during which vronsky  since he had to look at something  looked at levin at his feet at his uniform then at his face and noticing his gloomy eyes fixed upon him he said in order to say something  how is it that you living constantly in the country are not a justice of the peace 
you are not in the uniform of one  
 it s because i consider that the justice of the peace is a silly institution  levin answered gloomily 
he had been all the time looking for an opportunity to enter into conversation with vronsky so as to smooth over his rudeness at their first meeting 
 i don t think so quite the contrary  vronsky said with quiet surprise 
 it s a plaything  levin cut him short 
 we don t want justices of the peace 
i ve never had a single thing to do with them during eight years 
and what i have had was decided wrongly by them 
the justice of the peace is over thirty miles from me 
for some matter of two roubles i should have to send a lawyer who costs me fifteen  
and he related how a peasant had stolen some flour from the miller and when the miller told him of it had lodged a complaint for slander 
all this was utterly uncalled for and stupid and levin felt it himself as he said it 
 oh this is such an original fellow  
said stepan arkadyevitch with his most soothing almond oil smile 
 but come along i think they re voting      and they separated 
 i can t understand  said sergey ivanovitch who had observed his brother s clumsiness i can t understand how anyone can be so absolutely devoid of political tact 
that s where we russians are so deficient 
the marshal of the province is our opponent and with him you re  ami cochon  and you beg him to stand 
count vronsky now   i m not making a friend of him he s asked me to dinner and i m not going but he s one of our side  why make an enemy of him 
then you ask nevyedovsky if he s going to stand 
that s not a thing to do  
 oh i don t understand it at all 
and it s all such nonsense  levin answered gloomily 
 you say it s all such nonsense but as soon as you have anything to do with it you make a muddle  
levin did not answer and they walked together into the big room 
the marshal of the province though he was vaguely conscious in the air of some trap being prepared for him and though he had not been called upon by all to stand had still made up his mind to stand 
all was silence in the room 
the secretary announced in a loud voice that the captain of the guards mihail stepanovitch snetkov would now be balloted for as marshal of the province 
the district marshals walked carrying plates on which were balls from their tables to the high table and the election began 
 put it in the right side  whispered stepan arkadyevitch as with his brother levin followed the marshal of his district to the table 
but levin had forgotten by now the calculations that had been explained to him and was afraid stepan arkadyevitch might be mistaken in saying the right side  
surely snetkov was the enemy 
as he went up he held the ball in his right hand but thinking he was wrong just at the box he changed to the left hand and undoubtedly put the ball to the left 
an adept in the business standing at the box and seeing by the mere action of the elbow where each put his ball scowled with annoyance 
it was no good for him to use his insight 
everything was still and the counting of the balls was heard 
then a single voice rose and proclaimed the numbers for and against 
the marshal had been voted for by a considerable majority 
all was noise and eager movement towards the doors 
snetkov came in and the nobles thronged round him congratulating him 
 well now is it over  
levin asked sergey ivanovitch 
 it s only just beginning  sviazhsky said replying for sergey ivanovitch with a smile 
 some other candidate may receive more votes than the marshal  
levin had quite forgotten about that 
now he could only remember that there was some sort of trickery in it but he was too bored to think what it was exactly 
he felt depressed and longed to get out of the crowd 
as no one was paying any attention to him and no one apparently needed him he quietly slipped away into the little room where the refreshments were and again had a great sense of comfort when he saw the waiters 
the little old waiter pressed him to have something and levin agreed 
after eating a cutlet with beans and talking to the waiters of their former masters levin not wishing to go back to the hall where it was all so distasteful to him proceeded to walk through the galleries 
the galleries were full of fashionably dressed ladies leaning over the balustrade and trying not to lose a single word of what was being said below 
with the ladies were sitting and standing smart lawyers high school teachers in spectacles and officers 
everywhere they were talking of the election and of how worried the marshal was and how splendid the discussions had been 
in one group levin heard his brother s praises 
one lady was telling a lawyer  how glad i am i heard koznishev 
it s worth losing one s dinner 
he s exquisite 
so clear and distinct all of it 
there s not one of you in the law courts that speaks like that 
the only one is meidel and he s not so eloquent by a long way  
finding a free place levin leaned over the balustrade and began looking and listening 
all the noblemen were sitting railed off behind barriers according to their districts 
in the middle of the room stood a man in a uniform who shouted in a loud high voice  as a candidate for the marshalship of the nobility of the province we call upon staff captain yevgeney ivanovitch apuhtin  
a dead silence followed and then a weak old voice was heard declined  
 we call upon the privy councilor pyotr petrovitch bol  the voice began again 
 declined  
a high boyish voice replied 
again it began and again declined  
and so it went on for about an hour 
levin with his elbows on the balustrade looked and listened 
at first he wondered and wanted to know what it meant then feeling sure that he could not make it out he began to be bored 
then recalling all the excitement and vindictiveness he had seen on all the faces he felt sad he made up his mind to go and went downstairs 
as he passed through the entry to the galleries he met a dejected high school boy walking up and down with tired looking eyes 
on the stairs he met a couple  a lady running quickly on her high heels and the jaunty deputy prosecutor 
 i told you you weren t late  the deputy prosecutor was saying at the moment when levin moved aside to let the lady pass 
levin was on the stairs to the way out and was just feeling in his waistcoat pocket for the number of his overcoat when the secretary overtook him 
 this way please konstantin dmitrievitch they are voting  
the candidate who was being voted on was nevyedovsky who had so stoutly denied all idea of standing 
levin went up to the door of the room it was locked 
the secretary knocked the door opened and levin was met by two red faced gentlemen who darted out 
 i can t stand any more of it  said one red faced gentleman 
after them the face of the marshal of the province was poked out 
his face was dreadful looking from exhaustion and dismay 
 i told you not to let any one out  
he cried to the doorkeeper 
 i let someone in your excellency  
 mercy on us  
and with a heavy sigh the marshal of the province walked with downcast head to the high table in the middle of the room his legs staggering in his white trousers 
nevyedovsky had scored a higher majority as they had planned and he was the new marshal of the province 
many people were amused many were pleased and happy many were in ecstasies many were disgusted and unhappy 
the former marshal of the province was in a state of despair which he could not conceal 
when nevyedovsky went out of the room the crowd thronged round him and followed him enthusiastically just as they had followed the governor who had opened the meetings and just as they had followed snetkov when he was elected 
chapter    the newly elected marshal and many of the successful party dined that day with vronsky 
vronsky had come to the elections partly because he was bored in the country and wanted to show anna his right to independence and also to repay sviazhsky by his support at the election for all the trouble he had taken for vronsky at the district council election but chiefly in order strictly to perform all those duties of a nobleman and landowner which he had taken upon himself 
but he had not in the least expected that the election would so interest him so keenly excite him and that he would be so good at this kind of thing 
he was quite a new man in the circle of the nobility of the province but his success was unmistakable and he was not wrong in supposing that he had already obtained a certain influence 
this influence was due to his wealth and reputation the capital house in the town lent him by his old friend shirkov who had a post in the department of finances and was director of a flourishing bank in kashin the excellent cook vronsky had brought from the country and his friendship with the governor who was a schoolfellow of vronsky s  a schoolfellow he had patronized and protected indeed 
but what contributed more than all to his success was his direct equable manner with everyone which very quickly made the majority of the noblemen reverse the current opinion of his supposed haughtiness 
he was himself conscious that except that whimsical gentleman married to kitty shtcherbatskaya who had  à propos de bottes  poured out a stream of irrelevant absurdities with such spiteful fury every nobleman with whom he had made acquaintance had become his adherent 
he saw clearly and other people recognized it too that he had done a great deal to secure the success of nevyedovsky 
and now at his own table celebrating nevyedovsky s election he was experiencing an agreeable sense of triumph over the success of his candidate 
the election itself had so fascinated him that if he could succeed in getting married during the next three years he began to think of standing himself  much as after winning a race ridden by a jockey he had longed to ride a race himself 
today he was celebrating the success of his jockey 
vronsky sat at the head of the table on his right hand sat the young governor a general of high rank 
to all the rest he was the chief man in the province who had solemnly opened the elections with his speech and aroused a feeling of respect and even of awe in many people as vronsky saw to vronsky he was little katka maslov  that had been his nickname in the pages corps  whom he felt to be shy and tried to  mettre à son aise 
on the left hand sat nevyedovsky with his youthful stubborn and malignant face 
with him vronsky was simple and deferential 
sviazhsky took his failure very light heartedly 
it was indeed no failure in his eyes as he said himself turning glass in hand to nevyedovsky they could not have found a better representative of the new movement which the nobility ought to follow 
and so every honest person as he said was on the side of today s success and was rejoicing over  it 
stepan arkadyevitch was glad too that he was having a good time and that everyone was pleased 
the episode of the elections served as a good occasion for a capital dinner 
sviazhsky comically imitated the tearful discourse of the marshal and observed addressing nevyedovsky that his excellency would have to select another more complicated method of auditing the accounts than tears 
another nobleman jocosely described how footmen in stockings had been ordered for the marshal s ball and how now they would have to be sent back unless the new marshal would give a ball with footmen in stockings 
continually during dinner they said of nevyedovsky  our marshal  and your excellency  
this was said with the same pleasure with which a bride is called madame and her husband s name 
nevyedovsky affected to be not merely indifferent but scornful of this appellation but it was obvious that he was highly delighted and had to keep a curb on himself not to betray the triumph which was unsuitable to their new liberal tone 
after dinner several telegrams were sent to people interested in the result of the election 
and stepan arkadyevitch who was in high good humor sent darya alexandrovna a telegram nevyedovsky elected by twenty votes 
congratulations 
tell people  
he dictated it aloud saying we must let them share our rejoicing  
darya alexandrovna getting the message simply sighed over the rouble wasted on it and understood that it was an after dinner affair 
she knew stiva had a weakness after dining for  faire jouer le télégraphe 
everything together with the excellent dinner and the wine not from russian merchants but imported direct from abroad was extremely dignified simple and enjoyable 
the party  some twenty  had been selected by sviazhsky from among the more active new liberals all of the same way of thinking who were at the same time clever and well bred 
they drank also half in jest to the health of the new marshal of the province of the governor of the bank director and of our amiable host  
vronsky was satisfied 
he had never expected to find so pleasant a tone in the provinces 
towards the end of dinner it was still more lively 
the governor asked vronsky to come to a concert for the benefit of the servians which his wife who was anxious to make his acquaintance had been getting up 
 there ll be a ball and you ll see the belle of the province 
worth seeing really  
 not in my line  vronsky answered 
he liked that english phrase 
but he smiled and promised to come 
before they rose from the table when all of them were smoking vronsky s valet went up to him with a letter on a tray 
 from vozdvizhenskoe by special messenger  he said with a significant expression 
 astonishing 
how like he is to the deputy prosecutor sventitsky  said one of the guests in french of the valet while vronsky frowning read the letter 
the letter was from anna 
before he read the letter he knew its contents 
expecting the elections to be over in five days he had promised to be back on friday 
today was saturday and he knew that the letter contained reproaches for not being back at the time fixed 
the letter he had sent the previous evening had probably not reached her yet 
the letter was what he had expected but the form of it was unexpected and particularly disagreeable to him 
 annie is very ill the doctor says it may be inflammation 
i am losing my head all alone 
princess varvara is no help but a hindrance 
i expected you the day before yesterday and yesterday and now i am sending to find out where you are and what you are doing 
i wanted to come myself but thought better of it knowing you would dislike it 
send some answer that i may know what to do  
the child ill yet she had thought of coming herself 
their daughter ill and this hostile tone 
the innocent festivities over the election and this gloomy burdensome love to which he had to return struck vronsky by their contrast 
but he had to go and by the first train that night he set off home 
chapter    before vronsky s departure for the elections anna had reflected that the scenes constantly repeated between them each time he left home might only make him cold to her instead of attaching him to her and resolved to do all she could to control herself so as to bear the parting with composure 
but the cold severe glance with which he had looked at her when he came to tell her he was going had wounded her and before he had started her peace of mind was destroyed 
in solitude afterwards thinking over that glance which had expressed his right to freedom she came as she always did to the same point  the sense of her own humiliation 
 he has the right to go away when and where he chooses 
not simply to go away but to leave me 
he has every right and i have none 
but knowing that he ought not to do it 
what has he done though    
he looked at me with a cold severe expression 
of course that is something indefinable impalpable but it has never been so before and that glance means a great deal  she thought 
 that glance shows the beginning of indifference  
and though she felt sure that a coldness was beginning there was nothing she could do she could not in any way alter her relations to him 
just as before only by love and by charm could she keep him 
and so just as before only by occupation in the day by morphine at night could she stifle the fearful thought of what would be if he ceased to love her 
it is true there was still one means not to keep him  for that she wanted nothing more than his love  but to be nearer to him to be in such a position that he would not leave her 
that means was divorce and marriage 
and she began to long for that and made up her mind to agree to it the first time he or stiva approached her on the subject 
absorbed in such thoughts she passed five days without him the five days that he was to be at the elections 
walks conversation with princess varvara visits to the hospital and most of all reading  reading of one book after another  filled up her time 
but on the sixth day when the coachman came back without him she felt that now she was utterly incapable of stifling the thought of him and of what he was doing there just at that time her little girl was taken ill  anna began to look after her but even that did not distract her mind especially as the illness was not serious 
however hard she tried she could not love this little child and to feign love was beyond her powers 
towards the evening of that day still alone anna was in such a panic about him that she decided to start for the town but on second thoughts wrote him the contradictory letter that vronsky received and without reading it through sent it off by a special messenger 
the next morning she received his letter and regretted her own 
she dreaded a repetition of the severe look he had flung at her at parting especially when he knew that the baby was not dangerously ill 
but still she was glad she had written to him 
at this moment anna was positively admitting to herself that she was a burden to him that he would relinquish his freedom regretfully to return to her and in spite of that she was glad he was coming 
let him weary of her but he would be here with her so that she would see him would know of every action he took 
she was sitting in the drawing room near a lamp with a new volume of taine and as she read listening to the sound of the wind outside and every minute expecting the carriage to arrive 
several times she had fancied she heard the sound of wheels but she had been mistaken 
at last she heard not the sound of wheels but the coachman s shout and the dull rumble in the covered entry 
even princess varvara playing patience confirmed this and anna flushing hotly got up but instead of going down as she had done twice before she stood still 
she suddenly felt ashamed of her duplicity but even more she dreaded how he might meet her 
all feeling of wounded pride had passed now she was only afraid of the expression of his displeasure 
she remembered that her child had been perfectly well again for the last two days 
she felt positively vexed with her for getting better from the very moment her letter was sent off 
then she thought of him that he was here all of him with his hands his eyes 
she heard his voice 
and forgetting everything she ran joyfully to meet him 
 well how is annie  
he said timidly from below looking up to anna as she ran down to him 
he was sitting on a chair and a footman was pulling off his warm over boot 
 oh she is better  
 and you  
he said shaking himself 
she took his hand in both of hers and drew it to her waist never taking her eyes off him 
 well i m glad  he said coldly scanning her her hair her dress which he knew she had put on for him 
all was charming but how many times it had charmed him 
and the stern stony expression that she so dreaded settled upon his face 
 well i m glad 
and are you well  
he said wiping his damp beard with his handkerchief and kissing her hand 
 never mind  she thought only let him be here and so long as he s here he cannot he dare not cease to love me  
the evening was spent happily and gaily in the presence of princess varvara who complained to him that anna had been taking morphine in his absence 
 what am i to do 
i couldn t sleep     my thoughts prevented me 
when he s here i never take it  hardly ever  
he told her about the election and anna knew how by adroit questions to bring him to what gave him most pleasure  his own success 
she told him of everything that interested him at home and all that she told him was of the most cheerful description 
but late in the evening when they were alone anna seeing that she had regained complete possession of him wanted to erase the painful impression of the glance he had given her for her letter 
she said  tell me frankly you were vexed at getting my letter and you didn t believe me  
as soon as she had said it she felt that however warm his feelings were to her he had not forgiven her for that 
 yes  he said the letter was so strange 
first annie ill and then you thought of coming yourself  
 it was all the truth  
 oh i don t doubt it  
 yes you do doubt it 
you are vexed i see  
 not for one moment 
i m only vexed that s true that you seem somehow unwilling to admit that there are duties     the duty of going to a concert     but we won t talk about it  he said 
 why not talk about it  
she said 
 i only meant to say that matters of real importance may turn up 
now for instance i shall have to go to moscow to arrange about the house     oh anna why are you so irritable 
don t you know that i can t live without you  
 if so  said anna her voice suddenly changing it means that you are sick of this life    
yes you will come for a day and go away as men do     anna that s cruel 
i am ready to give up my whole life  
but she did not hear him 
 if you go to moscow i will go too 
i will not stay here 
either we must separate or else live together  
 why you know that s my one desire 
but for that     we must get a divorce 
i will write to him 
i see i cannot go on like this    
but i will come with you to moscow  
 you talk as if you were threatening me 
but i desire nothing so much as never to be parted from you  said vronsky smiling 
but as he said these words there gleamed in his eyes not merely a cold look but the vindictive look of a man persecuted and made cruel 
she saw the look and correctly divined its meaning 
 if so it s a calamity  
that glance told her 
it was a moment s impression but she never forgot it 
anna wrote to her husband asking him about a divorce and towards the end of november taking leave of princess varvara who wanted to go to petersburg she went with vronsky to moscow 
expecting every day an answer from alexey alexandrovitch and after that the divorce they now established themselves together like married people 
part     chapter    the levins had been three months in moscow 
the date had long passed on which according to the most trustworthy calculations of people learned in such matters kitty should have been confined 
but she was still about and there was nothing to show that her time was any nearer than two months ago 
the doctor the monthly nurse and dolly and her mother and most of all levin who could not think of the approaching event without terror began to be impatient and uneasy 
kitty was the only person who felt perfectly calm and happy 
she was distinctly conscious now of the birth of a new feeling of love for the future child for her to some extent actually existing already and she brooded blissfully over this feeling 
he was not by now altogether a part of herself but sometimes lived his own life independently of her 
often this separate being gave her pain but at the same time she wanted to laugh with a strange new joy 
all the people she loved were with her and all were so good to her so attentively caring for her so entirely pleasant was everything presented to her that if she had not known and felt that it must all soon be over she could not have wished for a better and pleasanter life 
the only thing that spoiled the charm of this manner of life was that her husband was not here as she loved him to be and as he was in the country 
she liked his serene friendly and hospitable manner in the country 
in the town he seemed continually uneasy and on his guard as though he were afraid someone would be rude to him and still more to her 
at home in the country knowing himself distinctly to be in his right place he was never in haste to be off elsewhere 
he was never unoccupied 
here in town he was in a continual hurry as though afraid of missing something and yet he had nothing to do 
and she felt sorry for him 
to others she knew he did not appear an object of pity 
on the contrary when kitty looked at him in society as one sometimes looks at those one loves trying to see him as if he were a stranger so as to catch the impression he must make on others she saw with a panic even of jealous fear that he was far indeed from being a pitiable figure that he was very attractive with his fine breeding his rather old fashioned reserved courtesy with women his powerful figure and striking as she thought and expressive face 
but she saw him not from without but from within she saw that here he was not himself that was the only way she could define his condition to herself 
sometimes she inwardly reproached him for his inability to live in the town sometimes she recognized that it was really hard for him to order his life here so that he could be satisfied with it 
what had he to do indeed 
he did not care for cards he did not go to a club 
spending the time with jovial gentlemen of oblonsky s type  she knew now what that meant   it meant drinking and going somewhere after drinking 
she could not think without horror of where men went on such occasions 
was he to go into society 
but she knew he could only find satisfaction in that if he took pleasure in the society of young women and that she could not wish for 
should he stay at home with her her mother and her sisters 
but much as she liked and enjoyed their conversations forever on the same subjects   aline nadine  as the old prince called the sisters talks  she knew it must bore him 
what was there left for him to do 
to go on writing at his book he had indeed attempted and at first he used to go to the library and make extracts and look up references for his book 
but as he told her the more he did nothing the less time he had to do anything 
and besides he complained that he had talked too much about his book here and that consequently all his ideas about it were muddled and had lost their interest for him 
one advantage in this town life was that quarrels hardly ever happened between them here in town 
whether it was that their conditions were different or that they had both become more careful and sensible in that respect they had no quarrels in moscow from jealousy which they had so dreaded when they moved from the country 
one event an event of great importance to both from that point of view did indeed happen  that was kitty s meeting with vronsky 
the old princess marya borissovna kitty s godmother who had always been very fond of her had insisted on seeing her 
kitty though she did not go into society at all on account of her condition went with her father to see the venerable old lady and there met vronsky 
the only thing kitty could reproach herself for at this meeting was that at the instant when she recognized in his civilian dress the features once so familiar to her her breath failed her the blood rushed to her heart and a vivid blush  she felt it  overspread her face 
but this lasted only a few seconds 
before her father who purposely began talking in a loud voice to vronsky had finished she was perfectly ready to look at vronsky to speak to him if necessary exactly as she spoke to princess marya borissovna and more than that to do so in such a way that everything to the faintest intonation and smile would have been approved by her husband whose unseen presence she seemed to feel about her at that instant 
she said a few words to him even smiled serenely at his joke about the elections which he called our parliament  
 she had to smile to show she saw the joke  
but she turned away immediately to princess marya borissovna and did not once glance at him till he got up to go then she looked at him but evidently only because it would be uncivil not to look at a man when he is saying good bye 
she was grateful to her father for saying nothing to her about their meeting vronsky but she saw by his special warmth to her after the visit during their usual walk that he was pleased with her 
she was pleased with herself 
she had not expected she would have had the power while keeping somewhere in the bottom of her heart all the memories of her old feeling for vronsky not only to seem but to be perfectly indifferent and composed with him 
levin flushed a great deal more than she when she told him she had met vronsky at princess marya borissovna s 
it was very hard for her to tell him this but still harder to go on speaking of the details of the meeting as he did not question her but simply gazed at her with a frown 
 i am very sorry you weren t there  she said 
 not that you weren t in the room   i couldn t have been so natural in your presence   i am blushing now much more much much more  she said blushing till the tears came into her eyes 
 but that you couldn t see through a crack  
the truthful eyes told levin that she was satisfied with herself and in spite of her blushing he was quickly reassured and began questioning her which was all she wanted 
when he had heard everything even to the detail that for the first second she could not help flushing but that afterwards she was just as direct and as much at her ease as with any chance acquaintance levin was quite happy again and said he was glad of it and would not now behave as stupidly as he had done at the election but would try the first time he met vronsky to be as friendly as possible 
 it s so wretched to feel that there s a man almost an enemy whom it s painful to meet  said levin 
 i m very very glad  
chapter    go please go then and call on the bols  kitty said to her husband when he came in to see her at eleven o clock before going out 
 i know you are dining at the club papa put down your name 
but what are you going to do in the morning  
 i am only going to katavasov  answered levin 
 why so early  
 he promised to introduce me to metrov 
i wanted to talk to him about my work 
he s a distinguished scientific man from petersburg  said levin 
 yes wasn t it his article you were praising so 
well and after that  
said kitty 
 i shall go to the court perhaps about my sister s business  
 and the concert  
she queried 
 i shan t go there all alone  
 no 
do go there are going to be some new things     that interested you so 
i should certainly go  
 well anyway i shall come home before dinner  he said looking at his watch 
 put on your frock coat so that you can go straight to call on countess bola  
 but is it absolutely necessary  
 oh absolutely 
he has been to see us 
come what is it 
you go in sit down talk for five minutes of the weather get up and go away  
 oh you wouldn t believe it 
i ve got so out of the way of all this that it makes me feel positively ashamed 
it s such a horrible thing to do 
a complete outsider walks in sits down stays on with nothing to do wastes their time and worries himself and walks away  
kitty laughed 
 why i suppose you used to pay calls before you were married didn t you  
 yes i did but i always felt ashamed and now i m so out of the way of it that by jove 
i d sooner go two days running without my dinner than pay this call 
one s so ashamed 
i feel all the while that they re annoyed that they re saying what has he come for   
 no they won t 
i ll answer for that  said kitty looking into his face with a laugh 
she took his hand 
 well good bye    do go please  
he was just going out after kissing his wife s hand when she stopped him 
 kostya do you know i ve only fifty roubles left  
 oh all right i ll go to the bank and get some 
how much  
he said with the expression of dissatisfaction she knew so well 
 no wait a minute  
she held his hand 
 let s talk about it it worries me 
i seem to spend nothing unnecessary but money seems to fly away simply 
we don t manage well somehow  
 oh it s all right  he said with a little cough looking at her from under his brows 
that cough she knew well 
it was a sign of intense dissatisfaction not with her but with himself 
he certainly was displeased not at so much money being spent but at being reminded of what he knowing something was unsatisfactory wanted to forget 
 i have told sokolov to sell the wheat and to borrow an advance on the mill 
we shall have money enough in any case  
 yes but i m afraid that altogether     oh it s all right all right  he repeated 
 well good bye darling  
 no i m really sorry sometimes that i listened to mamma 
how nice it would have been in the country 
as it is i m worrying you all and we re wasting our money  
 not at all not at all 
not once since i ve been married have i said that things could have been better than they are      truly  
she said looking into his eyes 
he had said it without thinking simply to console her 
but when he glanced at her and saw those sweet truthful eyes fastened questioningly on him he repeated it with his whole heart 
 i was positively forgetting her  he thought 
and he remembered what was before them so soon to come 
 will it be soon 
how do you feel  
he whispered taking her two hands 
 i have so often thought so that now i don t think about it or know anything about it  
 and you re not frightened  
she smiled contemptuously 
 not the least little bit  she said 
 well if anything happens i shall be at katavasov s  
 no nothing will happen and don t think about it 
i m going for a walk on the boulevard with papa 
we re going to see dolly 
i shall expect you before dinner 
oh yes 
do you know that dolly s position is becoming utterly impossible 
she s in debt all round she hasn t a penny 
we were talking yesterday with mamma and arseny this was her sister s husband lvov  and we determined to send you with him to talk to stiva 
it s really unbearable 
one can t speak to papa about it    
but if you and he     why what can we do  
said levin 
 you ll be at arseny s anyway talk to him he will tell what we decided  
 oh i agree to everything arseny thinks beforehand 
i ll go and see him 
by the way if i do go to the concert i ll go with natalia 
well good bye  
on the steps levin was stopped by his old servant kouzma who had been with him before his marriage and now looked after their household in town 
 beauty that was the left shaft horse brought up from the country has been badly shod and is quite lame  he said 
 what does your honor wish to be done  
during the first part of their stay in moscow levin had used his own horses brought up from the country 
he had tried to arrange this part of their expenses in the best and cheapest way possible but it appeared that their own horses came dearer than hired horses and they still hired too 
 send for the veterinary there may be a bruise  
 and for katerina alexandrovna  
asked kouzma 
levin was not by now struck as he had been at first by the fact that to get from one end of moscow to the other he had to have two powerful horses put into a heavy carriage to take the carriage three miles through the snowy slush and to keep it standing there four hours paying five roubles every time 
now it seemed quite natural 
 hire a pair for our carriage from the jobmaster  said he 
 yes sir  
and so simply and easily thanks to the facilities of town life levin settled a question which in the country would have called for so much personal trouble and exertion and going out onto the steps he called a sledge sat down and drove to nikitsky 
on the way he thought no more of money but mused on the introduction that awaited him to the petersburg savant a writer on sociology and what he would say to him about his book 
only during the first days of his stay in moscow levin had been struck by the expenditure strange to one living in the country unproductive but inevitable that was expected of him on every side 
but by now he had grown used to it 
that had happened to him in this matter which is said to happen to drunkards  the first glass sticks in the throat the second flies down like a hawk but after the third they re like tiny little birds 
when levin had changed his first hundred rouble note to pay for liveries for his footmen and hall porter he could not help reflecting that these liveries were of no use to anyone  but they were indubitably necessary to judge by the amazement of the princess and kitty when he suggested that they might do without liveries   that these liveries would cost the wages of two laborers for the summer that is would pay for about three hundred working days from easter to ash wednesday and each a day of hard work from early morning to late evening  and that hundred rouble note did stick in his throat 
but the next note changed to pay for providing a dinner for their relations that cost twenty eight roubles though it did excite in levin the reflection that twenty eight roubles meant nine measures of oats which men would with groans and sweat have reaped and bound and thrashed and winnowed and sifted and sown   this next one he parted with more easily 
and now the notes he changed no longer aroused such reflections and they flew off like little birds 
whether the labor devoted to obtaining the money corresponded to the pleasure given by what was bought with it was a consideration he had long ago dismissed 
his business calculation that there was a certain price below which he could not sell certain grain was forgotten too 
the rye for the price of which he had so long held out had been sold for fifty kopecks a measure cheaper than it had been fetching a month ago 
even the consideration that with such an expenditure he could not go on living for a year without debt that even had no force 
only one thing was essential to have money in the bank without inquiring where it came from so as to know that one had the wherewithal to buy meat for tomorrow 
and this condition had hitherto been fulfilled he had always had the money in the bank 
but now the money in the bank had gone and he could not quite tell where to get the next installment 
and this it was which at the moment when kitty had mentioned money had disturbed him but he had no time to think about it 
he drove off thinking of katavasov and the meeting with metrov that was before him 
chapter    levin had on this visit to town seen a great deal of his old friend at the university professor katavasov whom he had not seen since his marriage 
he liked in katavasov the clearness and simplicity of his conception of life 
levin thought that the clearness of katavasov s conception of life was due to the poverty of his nature katavasov thought that the disconnectedness of levin s ideas was due to his lack of intellectual discipline but levin enjoyed katavasov s clearness and katavasov enjoyed the abundance of levin s untrained ideas and they liked to meet and to discuss 
levin had read katavasov some parts of his book and he had liked them 
on the previous day katavasov had met levin at a public lecture and told him that the celebrated metrov whose article levin had so much liked was in moscow that he had been much interested by what katavasov had told him about levin s work and that he was coming to see him tomorrow at eleven and would be very glad to make levin s acquaintance 
 you re positively a reformed character i m glad to see  said katavasov meeting levin in the little drawing room 
 i heard the bell and thought  impossible that it can be he at the exact time    
well what do you say to the montenegrins now 
they re a race of warriors  
 why what s happened  
asked levin 
katavasov in a few words told him the last piece of news from the war and going into his study introduced levin to a short thick set man of pleasant appearance 
this was metrov 
the conversation touched for a brief space on politics and on how recent events were looked at in the higher spheres in petersburg 
metrov repeated a saying that had reached him through a most trustworthy source reported as having been uttered on this subject by the tsar and one of the ministers 
katavasov had heard also on excellent authority that the tsar had said something quite different 
levin tried to imagine circumstances in which both sayings might have been uttered and the conversation on that topic dropped 
 yes here he s written almost a book on the natural conditions of the laborer in relation to the land  said katavasov i m not a specialist but i as a natural science man was pleased at his not taking mankind as something outside biological laws but on the contrary seeing his dependence on his surroundings and in that dependence seeking the laws of his development  
 that s very interesting  said metrov 
 what i began precisely was to write a book on agriculture but studying the chief instrument of agriculture the laborer  said levin reddening i could not help coming to quite unexpected results  
and levin began carefully as it were feeling his ground to expound his views 
he knew metrov had written an article against the generally accepted theory of political economy but to what extent he could reckon on his sympathy with his own new views he did not know and could not guess from the clever and serene face of the learned man 
 but in what do you see the special characteristics of the russian laborer  
said metrov in his biological characteristics so to speak or in the condition in which he is placed  
levin saw that there was an idea underlying this question with which he did not agree 
but he went on explaining his own idea that the russian laborer has a quite special view of the land different from that of other people and to support this proposition he made haste to add that in his opinion this attitude of the russian peasant was due to the consciousness of his vocation to people vast unoccupied expanses in the east 
 one may easily be led into error in basing any conclusion on the general vocation of a people  said metrov interrupting levin 
 the condition of the laborer will always depend on his relation to the land and to capital  
and without letting levin finish explaining his idea metrov began expounding to him the special point of his own theory 
in what the point of his theory lay levin did not understand because he did not take the trouble to understand 
he saw that metrov like other people in spite of his own article in which he had attacked the current theory of political economy looked at the position of the russian peasant simply from the point of view of capital wages and rent 
he would indeed have been obliged to admit that in the eastern  much the larger  part of russia rent was as yet nil that for nine tenths of the eighty millions of the russian peasants wages took the form simply of food provided for themselves and that capital does not so far exist except in the form of the most primitive tools 
yet it was only from that point of view that he considered every laborer though in many points he differed from the economists and had his own theory of the wage fund which he expounded to levin 
levin listened reluctantly and at first made objections 
he would have liked to interrupt metrov to explain his own thought which in his opinion would have rendered further exposition of metrov s theories superfluous 
but later on feeling convinced that they looked at the matter so differently that they could never understand one another he did not even oppose his statements but simply listened 
although what metrov was saying was by now utterly devoid of interest for him he yet experienced a certain satisfaction in listening to him 
it flattered his vanity that such a learned man should explain his ideas to him so eagerly with such intensity and confidence in levin s understanding of the subject sometimes with a mere hint referring him to a whole aspect of the subject 
he put this down to his own credit unaware that metrov who had already discussed his theory over and over again with all his intimate friends talked of it with special eagerness to every new person and in general was eager to talk to anyone of any subject that interested him even if still obscure to himself 
 we are late though  said katavasov looking at his watch directly metrov had finished his discourse 
 yes there s a meeting of the society of amateurs today in commemoration of the jubilee of svintitch  said katavasov in answer to levin s inquiry 
 pyotr ivanovitch and i were going 
i ve promised to deliver an address on his labors in zoology 
come along with us it s very interesting  
 yes and indeed it s time to start  said metrov 
 come with us and from there if you care to come to my place 
i should very much like to hear your work  
 oh no 
it s no good yet it s unfinished 
but i shall be very glad to go to the meeting  
 i say friends have you heard 
he has handed in the separate report  katavasov called from the other room where he was putting on his frock coat 
and a conversation sprang up upon the university question which was a very important event that winter in moscow 
three old professors in the council had not accepted the opinion of the younger professors 
the young ones had registered a separate resolution 
this in the judgment of some people was monstrous in the judgment of others it was the simplest and most just thing to do and the professors were split up into two parties 
one party to which katavasov belonged saw in the opposite party a scoundrelly betrayal and treachery while the opposite party saw in them childishness and lack of respect for the authorities 
levin though he did not belong to the university had several times already during his stay in moscow heard and talked about this matter and had his own opinion on the subject 
he took part in the conversation that was continued in the street as they all three walked to the buildings of the old university 
the meeting had already begun 
round the cloth covered table at which katavasov and metrov seated themselves there were some half dozen persons and one of these was bending close over a manuscript reading something aloud 
levin sat down in one of the empty chairs that were standing round the table and in a whisper asked a student sitting near what was being read 
the student eyeing levin with displeasure said  biography  
though levin was not interested in the biography he could not help listening and learned some new and interesting facts about the life of the distinguished man of science 
when the reader had finished the chairman thanked him and read some verses of the poet ment sent him on the jubilee and said a few words by way of thanks to the poet 
then katavasov in his loud ringing voice read his address on the scientific labors of the man whose jubilee was being kept 
when katavasov had finished levin looked at his watch saw it was past one and thought that there would not be time before the concert to read metrov his book and indeed he did not now care to do so 
during the reading he had thought over their conversation 
he saw distinctly now that though metrov s ideas might perhaps have value his own ideas had a value too and their ideas could only be made clear and lead to something if each worked separately in his chosen path and that nothing would be gained by putting their ideas together 
and having made up his mind to refuse metrov s invitation levin went up to him at the end of the meeting 
metrov introduced levin to the chairman with whom he was talking of the political news 
metrov told the chairman what he had already told levin and levin made the same remarks on his news that he had already made that morning but for the sake of variety he expressed also a new opinion which had only just struck him 
after that the conversation turned again on the university question 
as levin had already heard it all he made haste to tell metrov that he was sorry he could not take advantage of his invitation took leave and drove to lvov s 
chapter    lvov the husband of natalia kitty s sister had spent all his life in  foreign capitals where he had been educated and had been in the diplomatic service 
during the previous year he had left the diplomatic service not owing to any unpleasantness he never had any unpleasantness with anyone  and was transferred to the department of the court of the palace in moscow in order to give his two boys the best education possible 
in spite of the striking contrast in their habits and views and the fact that lvov was older than levin they had seen a great deal of one another that winter and had taken a great liking to each other 
lvov was at home and levin went in to him unannounced 
lvov in a house coat with a belt and in chamois leather shoes was sitting in an armchair and with a pince nez with blue glasses he was reading a book that stood on a reading desk while in his beautiful hand he held a half burned cigarette daintily away from him 
his handsome delicate and still youthful looking face to which his curly glistening silvery hair gave a still more aristocratic air lighted up with a smile when he saw levin 
 capital 
i was meaning to send to you 
how s kitty 
sit here it s more comfortable  
he got up and pushed up a rocking chair 
 have you read the last circular in the  journal de st petersbourg 
i think it s excellent  he said with a slight french accent 
levin told him what he had heard from katavasov was being said in petersburg and after talking a little about politics he told him of his interview with metrov and the learned society s meeting 
to lvov it was very interesting 
 that s what i envy you that you are able to mix in these interesting scientific circles  he said 
and as he talked he passed as usual into french which was easier to him 
 it s true i haven t the time for it 
my official work and the children leave me no time and then i m not ashamed to own that my education has been too defective  
 that i don t believe  said levin with a smile feeling as he always did touched at lvov s low opinion of himself which was not in the least put on from a desire to seem or to be modest but was absolutely sincere 
 oh yes indeed 
i feel now how badly educated i am 
to educate my children i positively have to look up a great deal and in fact simply to study myself 
for it s not enough to have teachers there must be someone to look after them just as on your land you want laborers and an overseer 
see what i m reading   he pointed to buslaev s  grammar  on the desk   it s expected of misha and it s so difficult     come explain to me    
here he says     levin tried to explain to him that it couldn t be understood but that it had to be taught but lvov would not agree with him 
 oh you re laughing at it  
 on the contrary you can t imagine how when i look at you i m always learning the task that lies before me that is the education of one s children  
 well there s nothing for you to learn  said lvov 
 all i know  said levin is that i have never seen better brought up children than yours and i wouldn t wish for children better than yours  
lvov visibly tried to restrain the expression of his delight but he was positively radiant with smiles 
 if only they re better than i 
that s all i desire 
you don t know yet all the work  he said with boys who ve been left like mine to run wild abroad  
 you ll catch all that up 
they re such clever children 
the great thing is the education of character 
that s what i learn when i look at your children  
 you talk of the education of character 
you can t imagine how difficult that is 
you have hardly succeeded in combating one tendency when others crop up and the struggle begins again 
if one had not a support in religion  you remember we talked about that  no father could bring children up relying on his own strength alone without that help  
this subject which always interested levin was cut short by the entrance of the beauty natalia alexandrovna dressed to go out 
 i didn t know you were here  she said unmistakably feeling no regret but a positive pleasure in interrupting this conversation on a topic she had heard so much of that she was by now weary of it 
 well how is kitty 
i am dining with you today 
i tell you what arseny  she turned to her husband you take the carriage  
and the husband and wife began to discuss their arrangements for the day 
as the husband had to drive to meet someone on official business while the wife had to go to the concert and some public meeting of a committee on the eastern question there was a great deal to consider and settle 
levin had to take part in their plans as one of themselves 
it was settled that levin should go with natalia to the concert and the meeting and that from there they should send the carriage to the office for arseny and he should call for her and take her to kitty s or that if he had not finished his work he should send the carriage back and levin would go with her 
 he s spoiling me  lvov said to his wife he assures me that our children are splendid when i know how much that s bad there is in them  
 arseny goes to extremes i always say  said his wife 
 if you look for perfection you will never be satisfied 
and it s true as papa says   that when we were brought up there was one extreme  we were kept in the basement while our parents lived in the best rooms now it s just the other way  the parents are in the wash house while the children are in the best rooms 
parents now are not expected to live at all but to exist altogether for their children  
 well what if they like it better  
lvov said with his beautiful smile touching her hand 
 anyone who didn t know you would think you were a stepmother not a true mother  
 no extremes are not good in anything  natalia said serenely putting his paper knife straight in its proper place on the table 
 well come here you perfect children  lvov said to the two handsome boys who came in and after bowing to levin went up to their father obviously wishing to ask him about something 
levin would have liked to talk to them to hear what they would say to their father but natalia began talking to him and then lvov s colleague in the service mahotin walked in wearing his court uniform to go with him to meet someone and a conversation was kept up without a break upon herzegovina princess korzinskaya the town council and the sudden death of madame apraksina 
levin even forgot the commission intrusted to him 
he recollected it as he was going into the hall 
 oh kitty told me to talk to you about oblonsky  he said as lvov was standing on the stairs seeing his wife and levin off 
 yes yes maman wants us  les beaux frères  to attack him  he said blushing 
 but why should i  
 well then i will attack him  said madame lvova with a smile standing in her white sheepskin cape waiting till they had finished speaking 
 come let us go  
chapter    at the concert in the afternoon two very interesting things were performed 
one was a fantasia  king lear  the other was a quartette dedicated to the memory of bach 
both were new and in the new style and levin was eager to form an opinion of them 
after escorting his sister in law to her stall he stood against a column and tried to listen as attentively and conscientiously as possible 
he tried not to let his attention be distracted and not to spoil his impression by looking at the conductor in a white tie waving his arms which always disturbed his enjoyment of music so much or the ladies in bonnets with strings carefully tied over their ears and all these people either thinking of nothing at all or thinking of all sorts of things except the music 
he tried to avoid meeting musical connoisseurs or talkative acquaintances and stood looking at the floor straight before him listening 
but the more he listened to the fantasia of king lear the further he felt from forming any definite opinion of it 
there was as it were a continual beginning a preparation of the musical expression of some feeling but it fell to pieces again directly breaking into new musical motives or simply nothing but the whims of the composer exceedingly complex but disconnected sounds 
and these fragmentary musical expressions though sometimes beautiful were disagreeable because they were utterly unexpected and not led up to by anything 
gaiety and grief and despair and tenderness and triumph followed one another without any connection like the emotions of a madman 
and those emotions like a madman s sprang up quite unexpectedly 
during the whole of the performance levin felt like a deaf man watching people dancing and was in a state of complete bewilderment when the fantasia was over and felt a great weariness from the fruitless strain on his attention 
loud applause resounded on all sides 
everyone got up moved about and began talking 
anxious to throw some light on his own perplexity from the impressions of others levin began to walk about looking for connoisseurs and was glad to see a well known musical amateur in conversation with pestsov whom he knew 
 marvelous  
pestsov was saying in his mellow bass 
 how are you konstantin dmitrievitch 
particularly sculpturesque and plastic so to say and richly colored is that passage where you feel cordelia s approach where woman  das ewig weibliche  enters into conflict with fate 
isn t it  
 you mean   what has cordelia to do with it  
levin asked timidly forgetting that the fantasia was supposed to represent king lear 
 cordelia comes in   see here  
said pestsov tapping his finger on the satiny surface of the program he held in his hand and passing it to levin 
only then levin recollected the title of the fantasia and made haste to read in the russian translation the lines from shakespeare that were printed on the back of the program 
 you can t follow it without that  said pestsov addressing levin as the person he had been speaking to had gone away and he had no one to talk to 
in the  entr acte  levin and pestsov fell into an argument upon the merits and defects of music of the wagner school 
levin maintained that the mistake of wagner and all his followers lay in their trying to take music into the sphere of another art just as poetry goes wrong when it tries to paint a face as the art of painting ought to do and as an instance of this mistake he cited the sculptor who carved in marble certain poetic phantasms flitting round the figure of the poet on the pedestal 
 these phantoms were so far from being phantoms that they were positively clinging on the ladder  said levin 
the comparison pleased him but he could not remember whether he had not used the same phrase before and to pestsov too and as he said it he felt confused 
pestsov maintained that art is one and that it can attain its highest manifestations only by conjunction with all kinds of art 
the second piece that was performed levin could not hear 
pestsov who was standing beside him was talking to him almost all the time condemning the music for its excessive affected assumption of simplicity and comparing it with the simplicity of the pre raphaelites in painting 
as he went out levin met many more acquaintances with whom he talked of politics of music and of common acquaintances 
among others he met count bol whom he had utterly forgotten to call upon 
 well go at once then  madame lvova said when he told her perhaps they ll not be at home and then you can come to the meeting to fetch me 
you ll find me still there  
chapter    perhaps they re not at home  
said levin as he went into the hall of countess bola s house 
 at home please walk in  said the porter resolutely removing his overcoat 
 how annoying  
thought levin with a sigh taking off one glove and stroking his hat 
 what did i come for 
what have i to say to them  
as he passed through the first drawing room levin met in the doorway countess bola giving some order to a servant with a care worn and severe face 
on seeing levin she smiled and asked him to come into the little drawing room where he heard voices 
in this room there were sitting in armchairs the two daughters of the countess and a moscow colonel whom levin knew 
levin went up greeted them and sat down beside the sofa with his hat on his knees 
 how is your wife 
have you been at the concert 
we couldn t go 
mamma had to be at the funeral service  
 yes i heard     what a sudden death  
said levin 
the countess came in sat down on the sofa and she too asked after his wife and inquired about the concert 
levin answered and repeated an inquiry about madame apraksina s sudden death 
 but she was always in weak health  
 were you at the opera yesterday  
 yes i was  
 lucca was very good  
 yes very good  he said and as it was utterly of no consequence to him what they thought of him he began repeating what they had heard a hundred times about the characteristics of the singer s talent 
countess bola pretended to be listening 
then when he had said enough and paused the colonel who had been silent till then began to talk 
the colonel too talked of the opera and about culture 
at last after speaking of the proposed  folle journée  at turin s the colonel laughed got up noisily and went away 
levin too rose but he saw by the face of the countess that it was not yet time for him to go 
he must stay two minutes longer 
he sat down 
but as he was thinking all the while how stupid it was he could not find a subject for conversation and sat silent 
 you are not going to the public meeting 
they say it will be very interesting  began the countess 
 no i promised my belle soeur to fetch her from it  said levin 
a silence followed 
the mother once more exchanged glances with a daughter 
 well now i think the time has come  thought levin and he got up 
the ladies shook hands with him and begged him to say mille choses  to his wife for them 
the porter asked him as he gave him his coat where is your honor staying  
and immediately wrote down his address in a big handsomely bound book 
 of course i don t care but still i feel ashamed and awfully stupid  thought levin consoling himself with the reflection that everyone does it 
he drove to the public meeting where he was to find his sister in law so as to drive home with her 
at the public meeting of the committee there were a great many people and almost all the highest society 
levin was in time for the report which as everyone said was very interesting 
when the reading of the report was over people moved about and levin met sviazhsky who invited him very pressingly to come that evening to a meeting of the society of agriculture where a celebrated lecture was to be delivered and stepan arkadyevitch who had only just come from the races and many other acquaintances and levin heard and uttered various criticisms on the meeting on the new fantasia and on a public trial 
but probably from the mental fatigue he was beginning to feel he made a blunder in speaking of the trial and this blunder he recalled several times with vexation 
speaking of the sentence upon a foreigner who had been condemned in russia and of how unfair it would be to punish him by exile abroad levin repeated what he had heard the day before in conversation from an acquaintance 
 i think sending him abroad is much the same as punishing a carp by putting it into the water  said levin 
then he recollected that this idea which he had heard from an acquaintance and uttered as his own came from a fable of krilov s and that the acquaintance had picked it up from a newspaper article 
after driving home with his sister in law and finding kitty in good spirits and quite well levin drove to the club 
chapter    levin reached the club just at the right time 
members and visitors were driving up as he arrived 
levin had not been at the club for a very long while  not since he lived in moscow when he was leaving the university and going into society 
he remembered the club the external details of its arrangement but he had completely forgotten the impression it had made on him in old days 
but as soon as driving into the wide semicircular court and getting out of the sledge he mounted the steps and the hall porter adorned with a crossway scarf noiselessly opened the door to him with a bow as soon as he saw in the porter s room the cloaks and galoshes of members who thought it less trouble to take them off downstairs as soon as he heard the mysterious ringing bell that preceded him as he ascended the easy carpeted staircase and saw the statue on the landing and the third porter at the top doors a familiar figure grown older in the club livery opening the door without haste or delay and scanning the visitors as they passed in  levin felt the old impression of the club come back in a rush an impression of repose comfort and propriety 
 your hat please  the porter said to levin who forgot the club rule to leave his hat in the porter s room 
 long time since you ve been 
the prince put your name down yesterday 
prince stepan arkadyevitch is not here yet  
the porter did not only know levin but also all his ties and relationships and so immediately mentioned his intimate friends 
passing through the outer hall divided up by screens and the room partitioned on the right where a man sits at the fruit buffet levin overtook an old man walking slowly in and entered the dining room full of noise and people 
he walked along the tables almost all full and looked at the visitors 
he saw people of all sorts old and young some he knew a little some intimate friends 
there was not a single cross or worried looking face 
all seemed to have left their cares and anxieties in the porter s room with their hats and were all deliberately getting ready to enjoy the material blessings of life 
sviazhsky was here and shtcherbatsky nevyedovsky and the old prince and vronsky and sergey ivanovitch 
 ah 
why are you late  
the prince said smiling and giving him his hand over his own shoulder 
 how s kitty  
he added smoothing out the napkin he had tucked in at his waistcoat buttons 
 all right they are dining at home all the three of them  
 ah aline nadine  to be sure 
there s no room with us 
go to that table and make haste and take a seat  said the prince and turning away he carefully took a plate of eel soup 
 levin this way  
a good natured voice shouted a little farther on 
it was turovtsin 
he was sitting with a young officer and beside them were two chairs turned upside down 
levin gladly went up to them 
he had always liked the good hearted rake turovtsin  he was associated in his mind with memories of his courtship  and at that moment after the strain of intellectual conversation the sight of turovtsin s good natured face was particularly welcome 
 for you and oblonsky 
he ll be here directly  
the young man holding himself very erect with eyes forever twinkling with enjoyment was an officer from petersburg gagin 
turovtsin introduced them 
 oblonsky s always late  
 ah here he is  
 have you only just come  
said oblonsky coming quickly towards them 
 good day 
had some vodka 
well come along then  
levin got up and went with him to the big table spread with spirits and appetizers of the most various kinds 
one would have thought that out of two dozen delicacies one might find something to one s taste but stepan arkadyevitch asked for something special and one of the liveried waiters standing by immediately brought what was required 
they drank a wine glassful and returned to their table 
at once while they were still at the soup gagin was served with champagne and told the waiter to fill four glasses 
levin did not refuse the wine and asked for a second bottle 
he was very hungry and ate and drank with great enjoyment and with still greater enjoyment took part in the lively and simple conversation of his companions 
gagin dropping his voice told the last good story from petersburg and the story though improper and stupid was so ludicrous that levin broke into roars of laughter so loud that those near looked round 
 that s in the same style as that s a thing i can t endure  
you know the story  
said stepan arkadyevitch 
 ah that s exquisite 
another bottle  he said to the waiter and he began to relate his good story 
 pyotr illyitch vinovsky invites you to drink with him  a little old waiter interrupted stepan arkadyevitch bringing two delicate glasses of sparkling champagne and addressing stepan arkadyevitch and levin 
stepan arkadyevitch took the glass and looking towards a bald man with red mustaches at the other end of the table he nodded to him smiling 
 who s that  
asked levin 
 you met him once at my place don t you remember 
a good natured fellow  
levin did the same as stepan arkadyevitch and took the glass 
stepan arkadyevitch s anecdote too was very amusing 
levin told his story and that too was successful 
then they talked of horses of the races of what they had been doing that day and of how smartly vronsky s atlas had won the first prize 
levin did not notice how the time passed at dinner 
 ah 
and here they are  
stepan arkadyevitch said towards the end of dinner leaning over the back of his chair and holding out his hand to vronsky who came up with a tall officer of the guards 
vronsky s face too beamed with the look of good humored enjoyment that was general in the club 
he propped his elbow playfully on stepan arkadyevitch s shoulder whispering something to him and he held out his hand to levin with the same good humored smile 
 very glad to meet you  he said 
 i looked out for you at the election but i was told you had gone away  
 yes i left the same day 
we ve just been talking of your horse 
i congratulate you  said levin 
 it was very rapidly run  
 yes you ve race horses too haven t you  
 no my father had but i remember and know something about it  
 where have you dined  
asked stepan arkadyevitch 
 we were at the second table behind the columns  
 we ve been celebrating his success  said the tall colonel 
 it s his second imperial prize 
i wish i might have the luck at cards he has with horses 
well why waste the precious time 
i m going to the infernal regions   added the colonel and he walked away 
 that s yashvin  vronsky said in answer to turovtsin and he sat down in the vacated seat beside them 
he drank the glass offered him and ordered a bottle of wine 
under the influence of the club atmosphere or the wine he had drunk levin chatted away to vronsky of the best breeds of cattle and was very glad not to feel the slightest hostility to this man 
he even told him among other things that he had heard from his wife that she had met him at princess marya borissovna s 
 ah princess marya borissovna she s exquisite  
said stepan arkadyevitch and he told an anecdote about her which set them all laughing 
vronsky particularly laughed with such simplehearted amusement that levin felt quite reconciled to him 
 well have we finished  
said stepan arkadyevitch getting up with a smile 
 let us go  
chapter    getting up from the table levin walked with gagin through the lofty room to the billiard room feeling his arms swing as he walked with a peculiar lightness and ease 
as he crossed the big room he came upon his father in law 
 well how do you like our temple of indolence  
said the prince taking his arm 
 come along come along  
 yes i wanted to walk about and look at everything 
it s interesting  
 yes it s interesting for you 
but its interest for me is quite different 
you look at those little old men now  he said pointing to a club member with bent back and projecting lip shuffling towards them in his soft boots and imagine that they were  shlupiks  like that from their birth up  
 how  shlupiks  
 i see you don t know that name 
that s our club designation 
you know the game of rolling eggs when one s rolled a long while it becomes a  shlupik 
so it is with us one goes on coming and coming to the club and ends by becoming a  shlupik 
ah you laugh 
but we look out for fear of dropping into it ourselves 
you know prince tchetchensky  
inquired the prince and levin saw by his face that he was just going to relate something funny 
 no i don t know him  
 you don t say so 
well prince tchetchensky is a well known figure 
no matter though 
he s always playing billiards here 
only three years ago he was not a  shlupik  and kept up his spirits and even used to call other people  shlupiks 
but one day he turns up and our porter   you know vassily 
why that fat one he s famous for his  bon mots 
and so prince tchetchensky asks him come vassily who s here 
any  shlupiks  here yet  
and he says you re the third  
yes my dear boy that he did  
talking and greeting the friends they met levin and the prince walked through all the rooms the great room where tables had already been set and the usual partners were playing for small stakes the divan room where they were playing chess and sergey ivanovitch was sitting talking to somebody the billiard room where about a sofa in a recess there was a lively party drinking champagne  gagin was one of them 
they peeped into the infernal regions  where a good many men were crowding round one table at which yashvin was sitting 
trying not to make a noise they walked into the dark reading room where under the shaded lamps there sat a young man with a wrathful countenance turning over one journal after another and a bald general buried in a book 
they went too into what the prince called the intellectual room where three gentlemen were engaged in a heated discussion of the latest political news 
 prince please come we re ready  said one of his card party who had come to look for him and the prince went off 
levin sat down and listened but recalling all the conversation of the morning he felt all of a sudden fearfully bored 
he got up hurriedly and went to look for oblonsky and turovtsin with whom it had been so pleasant 
turovtsin was one of the circle drinking in the billiard room and stepan arkadyevitch was talking with vronsky near the door at the farther corner of the room 
 it s not that she s dull but this undefined this unsettled position  levin caught and he was hurrying away but stepan arkadyevitch called to him 
 levin  said stepan arkadyevitch and levin noticed that his eyes were not full of tears exactly but moist which always happened when he had been drinking or when he was touched 
just now it was due to both causes 
 levin don t go  he said and he warmly squeezed his arm above the elbow obviously not at all wishing to let him go 
 this is a true friend of mine  almost my greatest friend  he said to vronsky 
 you have become even closer and dearer to me 
and i want you and i know you ought to be friends and great friends because you re both splendid fellows  
 well there s nothing for us now but to kiss and be friends  vronsky said with good natured playfulness holding out his hand 
levin quickly took the offered hand and pressed it warmly 
 i m very very glad  said levin 
 waiter a bottle of champagne  said stepan arkadyevitch 
 and i m very glad  said vronsky 
but in spite of stepan arkadyevitch s desire and their own desire they had nothing to talk about and both felt it 
 do you know he has never met anna  
stepan arkadyevitch said to vronsky 
 and i want above everything to take him to see her 
let us go levin  
 really  
said vronsky 
 she will be very glad to see you 
i should be going home at once  he added but i m worried about yashvin and i want to stay on till he finishes  
 why is he losing  
 he keeps losing and i m the only friend that can restrain him  
 well what do you say to pyramids 
levin will you play 
capital  
said stepan arkadyevitch 
 get the table ready  he said to the marker 
 it has been ready a long while  answered the marker who had already set the balls in a triangle and was knocking the red one about for his own diversion 
 well let us begin  
after the game vronsky and levin sat down at gagin s table and at stepan arkadyevitch s suggestion levin took a hand in the game 
vronsky sat down at the table surrounded by friends who were incessantly coming up to him 
every now and then he went to the infernal to keep an eye on yashvin 
levin was enjoying a delightful sense of repose after the mental fatigue of the morning 
he was glad that all hostility was at an end with vronsky and the sense of peace decorum and comfort never left him 
when the game was over stepan arkadyevitch took levin s arm 
 well let us go to anna s then 
at once 
eh 
she is at home 
i promised her long ago to bring you 
where were you meaning to spend the evening  
 oh nowhere specially 
i promised sviazhsky to go to the society of agriculture 
by all means let us go  said levin 
 very good come along 
find out if my carriage is here  stepan arkadyevitch said to the waiter 
levin went up to the table paid the forty roubles he had lost paid his bill the amount of which was in some mysterious way ascertained by the little old waiter who stood at the counter and swinging his arms he walked through all the rooms to the way out 
chapter    oblonsky s carriage  
the porter shouted in an angry bass 
the carriage drove up and both got in 
it was only for the first few moments while the carriage was driving out of the clubhouse gates that levin was still under the influence of the club atmosphere of repose comfort and unimpeachable good form 
but as soon as the carriage drove out into the street and he felt it jolting over the uneven road heard the angry shout of a sledge driver coming towards them saw in the uncertain light the red blind of a tavern and the shops this impression was dissipated and he began to think over his actions and to wonder whether he was doing right in going to see anna 
what would kitty say 
but stepan arkadyevitch gave him no time for reflection and as though divining his doubts he scattered them 
 how glad i am  he said that you should know her 
you know dolly has long wished for it 
and lvov s been to see her and often goes 
though she is my sister  stepan arkadyevitch pursued i don t hesitate to say that she s a remarkable woman 
but you will see 
her position is very painful especially now  
 why especially now  
 we are carrying on negotiations with her husband about a divorce 
and he s agreed but there are difficulties in regard to the son and the business which ought to have been arranged long ago has been dragging on for three months past 
as soon as the divorce is over she will marry vronsky 
how stupid these old ceremonies are that no one believes in and which only prevent people being comfortable  
stepan arkadyevitch put in 
 well then their position will be as regular as mine as yours  
 what is the difficulty  
said levin 
 oh it s a long and tedious story 
the whole business is in such an anomalous position with us 
but the point is she has been for three months in moscow where everyone knows her waiting for the divorce she goes out nowhere sees no woman except dolly because do you understand she doesn t care to have people come as a favor 
that fool princess varvara even she has left her considering this a breach of propriety 
well you see in such a position any other woman would not have found resources in herself 
but you ll see how she has arranged her life  how calm how dignified she is 
to the left in the crescent opposite the church  
shouted stepan arkadyevitch leaning out of the window 
 phew 
how hot it is  
he said in spite of twelve degrees of frost flinging his open overcoat still wider open 
 but she has a daughter no doubt she s busy looking after her  
said levin 
 i believe you picture every woman simply as a female  une couveuse  said stepan arkadyevitch 
 if she s occupied it must be with her children 
no she brings her up capitally i believe but one doesn t hear about her 
she s busy in the first place with what she writes 
i see you re smiling ironically but you re wrong 
she s writing a children s book and doesn t talk about it to anyone but she read it to me and i gave the manuscript to vorkuev   you know the publisher   and he s an author himself too i fancy 
he understands those things and he says it s a remarkable piece of work 
but are you fancying she s an authoress   not a bit of it 
she s a woman with a heart before everything but you ll see 
now she has a little english girl with her and a whole family she s looking after  
 oh something in a philanthropic way  
 why you will look at everything in the worst light 
it s not from philanthropy it s from the heart 
they  that is vronsky  had a trainer an englishman first rate in his own line but a drunkard 
he s completely given up to drink  delirium tremens  and the family were cast on the world 
she saw them helped them got more and more interested in them and now the whole family is on her hands 
but not by way of patronage you know helping with money she s herself preparing the boys in russian for the high school and she s taken the little girl to live with her 
but you ll see her for yourself  
the carriage drove into the courtyard and stepan arkadyevitch rang loudly at the entrance where sledges were standing 
and without asking the servant who opened the door whether the lady were at home stepan arkadyevitch walked into the hall 
levin followed him more and more doubtful whether he was doing right or wrong 
looking at himself in the glass levin noticed that he was red in the face but he felt certain he was not drunk and he followed stepan arkadyevitch up the carpeted stairs 
at the top stepan arkadyevitch inquired of the footman who bowed to him as to an intimate friend who was with anna arkadyevna and received the answer that it was m vorkuev 
 where are they  
 in the study  
passing through the dining room a room not very large with dark paneled walls stepan arkadyevitch and levin walked over the soft carpet to the half dark study lighted up by a single lamp with a big dark shade 
another lamp with a reflector was hanging on the wall lighting up a big full length portrait of a woman which levin could not help looking at 
it was the portrait of anna painted in italy by mihailov 
while stepan arkadyevitch went behind the  treillage  and the man s voice which had been speaking paused levin gazed at the portrait which stood out from the frame in the brilliant light thrown on it and he could not tear himself away from it 
he positively forgot where he was and not even hearing what was said he could not take his eyes off the marvelous portrait 
it was not a picture but a living charming woman with black curling hair with bare arms and shoulders with a pensive smile on the lips covered with soft down triumphantly and softly she looked at him with eyes that baffled him 
she was not living only because she was more beautiful than a living woman can be 
 i am delighted  
he heard suddenly near him a voice unmistakably addressing him the voice of the very woman he had been admiring in the portrait 
anna had come from behind the treillage to meet him and levin saw in the dim light of the study the very woman of the portrait in a dark blue shot gown not in the same position nor with the same expression but with the same perfection of beauty which the artist had caught in the portrait 
she was less dazzling in reality but on the other hand there was something fresh and seductive in the living woman which was not in the portrait 
chapter    she had risen to meet him not concealing her pleasure at seeing him  and in the quiet ease with which she held out her little vigorous hand introduced him to vorkuev and indicated a red haired pretty little girl who was sitting at work calling her her pupil levin recognized and liked the manners of a woman of the great world always self possessed and natural 
 i am delighted delighted  she repeated and on her lips these simple words took for levin s ears a special significance 
 i have known you and liked you for a long while both from your friendship with stiva and for your wife s sake    
i knew her for a very short time but she left on me the impression of an exquisite flower simply a flower 
and to think she will soon be a mother  
she spoke easily and without haste looking now and then from levin to her brother and levin felt that the impression he was making was good and he felt immediately at home simple and happy with her as though he had known her from childhood 
 ivan petrovitch and i settled in alexey s study  she said in answer to stepan arkadyevitch s question whether he might smoke just so as to be able to smoke   and glancing at levin instead of asking whether he would smoke she pulled closer a tortoise shell cigar case and took a cigarette 
 how are you feeling today  
her brother asked her 
 oh nothing 
nerves as usual  
 yes isn t it extraordinarily fine  
said stepan arkadyevitch noticing that levin was scrutinizing the picture 
 i have never seen a better portrait  
 and extraordinarily like isn t it  
said vorkuev 
levin looked from the portrait to the original 
a peculiar brilliance lighted up anna s face when she felt his eyes on her 
levin flushed and to cover his confusion would have asked whether she had seen darya alexandrovna lately but at that moment anna spoke 
 we were just talking ivan petrovitch and i of vashtchenkov s last pictures 
have you seen them  
 yes i have seen them  answered levin 
 but i beg your pardon i interrupted you   you were saying     
levin asked if she had seen dolly lately 
 she was here yesterday 
she was very indignant with the high school people on grisha s account 
the latin teacher it seems had been unfair to him  
 yes i have seen his pictures 
i didn t care for them very much  levin went back to the subject she had started 
levin talked now not at all with that purely businesslike attitude to the subject with which he had been talking all the morning 
every word in his conversation with her had a special significance 
and talking to her was pleasant still pleasanter it was to listen to her 
anna talked not merely naturally and cleverly but cleverly and carelessly attaching no value to her own ideas and giving great weight to the ideas of the person she was talking to 
the conversation turned on the new movement in art on the new illustrations of the bible by a french artist 
vorkuev attacked the artist for a realism carried to the point of coarseness 
levin said that the french had carried conventionality further than anyone and that consequently they see a great merit in the return to realism 
in the fact of not lying they see poetry 
never had anything clever said by levin given him so much pleasure as this remark 
anna s face lighted up at once as at once she appreciated the thought 
she laughed 
 i laugh  she said as one laughs when one sees a very true portrait 
what you said so perfectly hits off french art now painting and literature too indeed  zola daudet 
but perhaps it is always so that men form their conceptions from fictitious conventional types and then  all the  combinaisons  made  they are tired of the fictitious figures and begin to invent more natural true figures  
 that s perfectly true  said vorknev 
 so you ve been at the club  
she said to her brother 
 yes yes this is a woman  
levin thought forgetting himself and staring persistently at her lovely mobile face which at that moment was all at once completely transformed 
levin did not hear what she was talking of as she leaned over to her brother but he was struck by the change of her expression 
her face  so handsome a moment before in its repose  suddenly wore a look of strange curiosity anger and pride 
but this lasted only an instant 
she dropped her eyelids as though recollecting something 
 oh well but that s of no interest to anyone  she said and she turned to the english girl 
 please order the tea in the drawing room  she said in english 
the girl got up and went out 
 well how did she get through her examination  
asked stepan arkadyevitch 
 splendidly 
she s a very gifted child and a sweet character  
 it will end in your loving her more than your own  
 there a man speaks 
in love there s no more nor less 
i love my daughter with one love and her with another  
 i was just telling anna arkadyevna  said vorkuev that if she were to put a hundredth part of the energy she devotes to this english girl to the public question of the education of russian children she would be doing a great and useful work  
 yes but i can t help it i couldn t do it 
count alexey kirillovitch urged me very much as she uttered the words  count alexey kirillovitch  she glanced with appealing timidity at levin and he unconsciously responded with a respectful and reassuring look  he urged me to take up the school in the village 
i visited it several times 
the children were very nice but i could not feel drawn to the work 
you speak of energy 
energy rests upon love and come as it will there s no forcing it 
i took to this child  i could not myself say why  
and she glanced again at levin 
and her smile and her glance  all told him that it was to him only she was addressing her words valuing his good opinion and at the same time sure beforehand that they understood each other 
 i quite understand that  levin answered 
 it s impossible to give one s heart to a school or such institutions in general and i believe that s just why philanthropic institutions always give such poor results  
she was silent for a while then she smiled 
 yes yes  she agreed i never could 
je n ai pas le coeur assez  large to love a whole asylum of horrid little girls 
cela ne m a jamais réussi 
there are so many women who have made themselves  une position sociale  in that way 
and now more than ever  she said with a mournful confiding expression ostensibly addressing her brother but unmistakably intending her words only for levin now when i have such need of some occupation i cannot  
and suddenly frowning levin saw that she was frowning at herself for talking about herself she changed the subject 
 i know about you  she said to levin that you re not a public spirited citizen and i have defended you to the best of my ability  
 how have you defended me  
 oh according to the attacks made on you 
but won t you have some tea  
she rose and took up a book bound in morocco 
 give it to me anna arkadyevna  said vorkuev indicating the book 
 it s well worth taking up  
 oh no it s all so sketchy  
 i told him about it  stepan arkadyevitch said to his sister nodding at levin 
 you shouldn t have 
my writing is something after the fashion of those little baskets and carving which liza mertsalova used to sell me from the prisons 
she had the direction of the prison department in that society  she turned to levin and they were miracles of patience the work of those poor wretches  
and levin saw a new trait in this woman who attracted him so extraordinarily 
besides wit grace and beauty she had truth 
she had no wish to hide from him all the bitterness of her position 
as she said that she sighed and her face suddenly taking a hard expression looked as it were turned to stone 
with that expression on her face she was more beautiful than ever but the expression was new it was utterly unlike that expression radiant with happiness and creating happiness which had been caught by the painter in her portrait 
levin looked more than once at the portrait and at her figure as taking her brother s arm she walked with him to the high doors and he felt for her a tenderness and pity at which he wondered himself 
she asked levin and vorkuev to go into the drawing room while she stayed behind to say a few words to her brother 
 about her divorce about vronsky and what he s doing at the club about me  
wondered levin 
and he was so keenly interested by the question of what she was saying to stepan arkadyevitch that he scarcely heard what vorkuev was telling him of the qualities of the story for children anna arkadyevna had written 
at tea the same pleasant sort of talk full of interesting matter continued 
there was not a single instant when a subject for conversation was to seek on the contrary it was felt that one had hardly time to say what one had to say and eagerly held back to hear what the others were saying 
and all that was said not only by her but by vorkuev and stepan arkadyevitch  all so it seemed to levin gained peculiar significance from her appreciation and her criticism 
while he followed this interesting conversation levin was all the time admiring her  her beauty her intelligence her culture and at the same time her directness and genuine depth of feeling 
he listened and talked and all the while he was thinking of her inner life trying to divine her feelings 
and though he had judged her so severely hitherto now by some strange chain of reasoning he was justifying her and was also sorry for her and afraid that vronsky did not fully understand her 
at eleven o clock when stepan arkadyevitch got up to go vorkuev had left earlier  it seemed to levin that he had only just come 
regretfully levin too rose 
 good bye  she said holding his hand and glancing into his face with a winning look 
 i am very glad  que la glace est rompue 
she dropped his hand and half closed her eyes 
 tell your wife that i love her as before and that if she cannot pardon me my position then my wish for her is that she may never pardon it 
to pardon it one must go through what i have gone through and may god spare her that  
 certainly yes i will tell her    levin said blushing 
chapter    what a marvelous sweet and unhappy woman  
he was thinking as he stepped out into the frosty air with stepan arkadyevitch 
 well didn t i tell you  
said stepan arkadyevitch seeing that levin had been completely won over 
 yes  said levin dreamily an extraordinary woman 
it s not her cleverness but she has such wonderful depth of feeling 
i m awfully sorry for her  
 now please god everything will soon be settled 
well well don t be hard on people in future  said stepan arkadyevitch opening the carriage door 
 good bye we don t go the same way  
still thinking of anna of everything even the simplest phrase in their conversation with her and recalling the minutest changes in her expression entering more and more into her position and feeling sympathy for her levin reached home 
at home kouzma told levin that katerina alexandrovna was quite well and that her sisters had not long been gone and he handed him two letters 
levin read them at once in the hall that he might not over look them later 
one was from sokolov his bailiff 
sokolov wrote that the corn could not be sold that it was fetching only five and a half roubles and that more than that could not be got for it 
the other letter was from his sister 
she scolded him for her business being still unsettled 
 well we must sell it at five and a half if we can t get more  levin decided the first question which had always before seemed such a weighty one with extraordinary facility on the spot 
 it s extraordinary how all one s time is taken up here  he thought considering the second letter 
he felt himself to blame for not having got done what his sister had asked him to do for her 
 today again i ve not been to the court but today i ve certainly not had time  
and resolving that he would not fail to do it next day he went up to his wife 
as he went in levin rapidly ran through mentally the day he had spent 
all the events of the day were conversations conversations he had heard and taken part in 
all the conversations were upon subjects which if he had been alone at home he would never have taken up but here they were very interesting 
and all these conversations were right enough only in two places there was something not quite right 
one was what he had said about the carp the other was something not quite the thing in the tender sympathy he was feeling for anna 
levin found his wife low spirited and dull 
the dinner of the three sisters had gone off very well but then they had waited and waited for him all of them had felt dull the sisters had departed and she had been left alone 
 well and what have you been doing  
she asked him looking straight into his eyes which shone with rather a suspicious brightness 
but that she might not prevent his telling her everything she concealed her close scrutiny of him and with an approving smile listened to his account of how he had spent the evening 
 well i m very glad i met vronsky 
i felt quite at ease and natural with him 
you understand i shall try not to see him but i m glad that this awkwardness is all over  he said and remembering that by way of trying not to see him he had immediately gone to call on anna he blushed 
 we talk about the peasants drinking i don t know which drinks most the peasantry or our own class the peasants do on holidays but     but kitty took not the slightest interest in discussing the drinking habits of the peasants 
she saw that he blushed and she wanted to know why 
 well and then where did you go  
 stiva urged me awfully to go and see anna arkadyevna  
and as he said this levin blushed even more and his doubts as to whether he had done right in going to see anna were settled once for all 
he knew now that he ought not to have done so 
kitty s eyes opened in a curious way and gleamed at anna s name but controlling herself with an effort she concealed her emotion and deceived him 
 oh  
was all she said 
 i m sure you won t be angry at my going 
stiva begged me to and dolly wished it  levin went on 
 oh no  
she said but he saw in her eyes a constraint that boded him no good 
 she is a very sweet very very unhappy good woman  he said telling her about anna her occupations and what she had told him to say to her 
 yes of course she is very much to be pitied  said kitty when he had finished 
 whom was your letter from  
he told her and believing in her calm tone he went to change his coat 
coming back he found kitty in the same easy chair 
when he went up to her she glanced at him and broke into sobs 
 what 
what is it  
he asked knowing beforehand what 
 you re in love with that hateful woman she has bewitched you 
i saw it in your eyes 
yes yes 
what can it all lead to 
you were drinking at the club drinking and gambling and then you went   to her of all people 
no we must go away    
i shall go away tomorrow  
it was a long while before levin could soothe his wife 
at last he succeeded in calming her only by confessing that a feeling of pity in conjunction with the wine he had drunk had been too much for him that he had succumbed to anna s artful influence and that he would avoid her 
one thing he did with more sincerity confess to was that living so long in moscow a life of nothing but conversation eating and drinking he was degenerating 
they talked till three o clock in the morning 
only at three o clock were they sufficiently reconciled to be able to go to sleep 
chapter    after taking leave of her guests anna did not sit down but began walking up and down the room 
she had unconsciously the whole evening done her utmost to arouse in levin a feeling of love  as of late she had fallen into doing with all young men  and she knew she had attained her aim as far as was possible in one evening with a married and conscientious man 
she liked him indeed extremely and in spite of the striking difference from the masculine point of view between vronsky and levin as a woman she saw something they had in common which had made kitty able to love both 
yet as soon as he was out of the room she ceased to think of him 
one thought and one only pursued her in different forms and refused to be shaken off 
 if i have so much effect on others on this man who loves his home and his wife why is it  he  is so cold to me    not cold exactly he loves me i know that 
but something new is drawing us apart now 
why wasn t he here all the evening 
he told stiva to say he could not leave yashvin and must watch over his play 
is yashvin a child 
but supposing it s true 
he never tells a lie 
but there s something else in it if it s true 
he is glad of an opportunity of showing me that he has other duties i know that i submit to that 
but why prove that to me 
he wants to show me that his love for me is not to interfere with his freedom 
but i need no proofs i need love 
he ought to understand all the bitterness of this life for me here in moscow 
is this life 
i am not living but waiting for an event which is continually put off and put off 
no answer again 
and stiva says he cannot go to alexey alexandrovitch 
and i can t write again 
i can do nothing can begin nothing can alter nothing i hold myself in i wait inventing amusements for myself  the english family writing reading  but it s all nothing but a sham it s all the same as morphine 
he ought to feel for me  she said feeling tears of self pity coming into her eyes 
she heard vronsky s abrupt ring and hurriedly dried her tears  not only dried her tears but sat down by a lamp and opened a book affecting composure 
she wanted to show him that she was displeased that he had not come home as he had promised  displeased only and not on any account to let him see her distress and least of all her self pity 
she might pity herself but he must not pity her 
she did not want strife she blamed him for wanting to quarrel but unconsciously put herself into an attitude of antagonism 
 well you ve not been dull  
he said eagerly and good humoredly going up to her 
 what a terrible passion it is  gambling  
 no i ve not been dull i ve learned long ago not to be dull 
stiva has been here and levin  
 yes they meant to come and see you 
well how did you like levin  
he said sitting down beside her 
 very much 
they have not long been gone 
what was yashvin doing  
 he was winning  seventeen thousand 
i got him away 
he had really started home but he went back again and now he s losing  
 then what did you stay for  
she asked suddenly lifting her eyes to him 
the expression of her face was cold and ungracious 
 you told stiva you were staying on to get yashvin away 
and you have left him there  
the same expression of cold readiness for the conflict appeared on his face too 
 in the first place i did not ask him to give you any message and secondly i never tell lies 
but what s the chief point i wanted to stay and i stayed  he said frowning 
 anna what is it for why will you  
he said after a moment s silence bending over towards her and he opened his hand hoping she would lay hers in it 
she was glad of this appeal for tenderness 
but some strange force of evil would not let her give herself up to her feelings as though the rules of warfare would not permit her to surrender 
 of course you wanted to stay and you stayed 
you do everything you want to 
but what do you tell me that for 
with what object  
she said getting more and more excited 
 does anyone contest your rights 
but you want to be right and you re welcome to be right  
his hand closed he turned away and his face wore a still more obstinate expression 
 for you it s a matter of obstinacy  she said watching him intently and suddenly finding the right word for that expression that irritated her simply obstinacy 
for you it s a question of whether you keep the upper hand of me while for me     again she felt sorry for herself and she almost burst into tears 
 if you knew what it is for me 
when i feel as i do now that you are hostile yes hostile to me if you knew what this means for me 
if you knew how i feel on the brink of calamity at this instant how afraid i am of myself  
and she turned away hiding her sobs 
 but what are you talking about  
he said horrified at her expression of despair and again bending over her he took her hand and kissed it 
 what is it for 
do i seek amusements outside our home 
don t i avoid the society of women  
 well yes 
if that were all  
she said 
 come tell me what i ought to do to give you peace of mind 
i am ready to do anything to make you happy  he said touched by her expression of despair what wouldn t i do to save you from distress of any sort as now anna  
he said 
 it s nothing nothing  
she said 
 i don t know myself whether it s the solitary life my nerves     come don t let us talk of it 
what about the race 
you haven t told me  
she inquired trying to conceal her triumph at the victory which had anyway been on her side 
he asked for supper and began telling her about the races but in his tone in his eyes which became more and more cold she saw that he did not forgive her for her victory that the feeling of obstinacy with which she had been struggling had asserted itself again in him 
he was colder to her than before as though he were regretting his surrender 
and she remembering the words that had given her the victory how i feel on the brink of calamity how afraid i am of myself  saw that this weapon was a dangerous one and that it could not be used a second time 
and she felt that beside the love that bound them together there had grown up between them some evil spirit of strife which she could not exorcise from his and still less from her own heart 
chapter    there are no conditions to which a man cannot become used especially if he sees that all around him are living in the same way 
levin could not have believed three months before that he could have gone quietly to sleep in the condition in which he was that day that leading an aimless irrational life living too beyond his means after drinking to excess he could not call what happened at the club anything else  forming inappropriately friendly relations with a man with whom his wife had once been in love and a still more inappropriate call upon a woman who could only be called a lost woman after being fascinated by that woman and causing his wife distress  he could still go quietly to sleep 
but under the influence of fatigue a sleepless night and the wine he had drunk his sleep was sound and untroubled 
at five o clock the creak of a door opening waked him 
he jumped up and looked round 
kitty was not in bed beside him 
but there was a light moving behind the screen and he heard her steps 
 what is it    what is it  
he said half asleep 
 kitty 
what is it  
 nothing  she said coming from behind the screen with a candle in her hand 
 i felt unwell  she said smiling a particularly sweet and meaning smile 
 what 
has it begun  
he said in terror 
 we ought to send    and hurriedly he reached after his clothes 
 no no  she said smiling and holding his hand 
 it s sure to be nothing 
i was rather unwell only a little 
it s all over now  
and getting into bed she blew out the candle lay down and was still 
though he thought her stillness suspicious as though she were holding her breath and still more suspicious the expression of peculiar tenderness and excitement with which as she came from behind the screen she said nothing  he was so sleepy that he fell asleep at once 
only later he remembered the stillness of her breathing and understood all that must have been passing in her sweet precious heart while she lay beside him not stirring in anticipation of the greatest event in a woman s life 
at seven o clock he was waked by the touch of her hand on his shoulder and a gentle whisper 
she seemed struggling between regret at waking him and the desire to talk to him 
 kostya don t be frightened 
it s all right 
but i fancy    we ought to send for lizaveta petrovna  
the candle was lighted again 
she was sitting up in bed holding some knitting which she had been busy upon during the last few days 
 please don t be frightened it s all right 
i m not a bit afraid  she said seeing his scared face and she pressed his hand to her bosom and then to her lips 
he hurriedly jumped up hardly awake and kept his eyes fixed on her as he put on his dressing gown then he stopped still looking at her 
he had to go but he could not tear himself from her eyes 
he thought he loved her face knew her expression her eyes but never had he seen it like this 
how hateful and horrible he seemed to himself thinking of the distress he had caused her yesterday 
her flushed face fringed with soft curling hair under her night cap was radiant with joy and courage 
though there was so little that was complex or artificial in kitty s character in general levin was struck by what was revealed now when suddenly all disguises were thrown off and the very kernel of her soul shone in her eyes 
and in this simplicity and nakedness of her soul she the very woman he loved in her was more manifest than ever 
she looked at him smiling but all at once her brows twitched she threw up her head and going quickly up to him clutched his hand and pressed close up to him breathing her hot breath upon him 
she was in pain and was as it were complaining to him of her suffering 
and for the first minute from habit it seemed to him that he was to blame 
but in her eyes there was a tenderness that told him that she was far from reproaching him that she loved him for her sufferings 
 if not i who is to blame for it  
he thought unconsciously seeking someone responsible for this suffering for him to punish but there was no one responsible 
she was suffering complaining and triumphing in her sufferings and rejoicing in them and loving them 
he saw that something sublime was being accomplished in her soul but what 
he could not make it out 
it was beyond his understanding 
 i have sent to mamma 
you go quickly to fetch lizaveta petrovna   kostya    
nothing it s over  
she moved away from him and rang the bell 
 well go now pasha s coming 
i am all right  
and levin saw with astonishment that she had taken up the knitting she had brought in in the night and begun working at it again 
as levin was going out of one door he heard the maid servant come in at the other 
he stood at the door and heard kitty giving exact directions to the maid and beginning to help her move the bedstead 
he dressed and while they were putting in his horses as a hired sledge was not to be seen yet he ran again up to the bedroom not on tiptoe it seemed to him but on wings 
two maid servants were carefully moving something in the bedroom 
kitty was walking about knitting rapidly and giving directions 
 i m going for the doctor 
they have sent for lizaveta petrovna but i ll go on there too 
isn t there anything wanted 
yes shall i go to dolly s  
she looked at him obviously not hearing what he was saying 
 yes yes 
do go  she said quickly frowning and waving her hand to him 
he had just gone into the drawing room when suddenly a plaintive moan sounded from the bedroom smothered instantly 
he stood still and for a long while he could not understand 
 yes that is she  he said to himself and clutching at his head he ran downstairs 
 lord have mercy on us 
pardon us 
aid us  
he repeated the words that for some reason came suddenly to his lips 
and he an unbeliever repeated these words not with his lips only 
at that instant he knew that all his doubts even the impossibility of believing with his reason of which he was aware in himself did not in the least hinder his turning to god 
all of that now floated out of his soul like dust 
to whom was he to turn if not to him in whose hands he felt himself his soul and his love 
the horse was not yet ready but feeling a peculiar concentration of his physical forces and his intellect on what he had to do he started off on foot without waiting for the horse and told kouzma to overtake him 
at the corner he met a night cabman driving hurriedly 
in the little sledge wrapped in a velvet cloak sat lizaveta petrovna with a kerchief round her head 
 thank god 
thank god  
he said overjoyed to recognize her little fair face which wore a peculiarly serious even stern expression 
telling the driver not to stop he ran along beside her 
 for two hours then 
not more  
she inquired 
 you should let pyotr dmitrievitch know but don t hurry him 
and get some opium at the chemist s  
 so you think that it may go on well 
lord have mercy on us and help us  
levin said seeing his own horse driving out of the gate 
jumping into the sledge beside kouzma he told him to drive to the doctor s 
chapter    the doctor was not yet up and the footman said that he had been up late and had given orders not to be waked but would get up soon  
the footman was cleaning the lamp chimneys and seemed very busy about them 
this concentration of the footman upon his lamps and his indifference to what was passing in levin at first astounded him but immediately on considering the question he realized that no one knew or was bound to know his feelings and that it was all the more necessary to act calmly sensibly and resolutely to get through this wall of indifference and attain his aim 
 don t be in a hurry or let anything slip  levin said to himself feeling a greater and greater flow of physical energy and attention to all that lay before him to do 
having ascertained that the doctor was not getting up levin considered various plans and decided on the following one that kouzma should go for another doctor while he himself should go to the chemist s for opium and if when he came back the doctor had not yet begun to get up he would either by tipping the footman or by force wake the doctor at all hazards 
at the chemist s the lank shopman sealed up a packet of powders for a coachman who stood waiting and refused him opium with the same callousness with which the doctor s footman had cleaned his lamp chimneys 
trying not to get flurried or out of temper levin mentioned the names of the doctor and midwife and explaining what the opium was needed for tried to persuade him 
the assistant inquired in german whether he should give it and receiving an affirmative reply from behind the partition he took out a bottle and a funnel deliberately poured the opium from a bigger bottle into a little one stuck on a label sealed it up in spite of levin s request that he would not do so and was about to wrap it up too 
this was more than levin could stand he took the bottle firmly out of his hands and ran to the big glass doors 
the doctor was not even now getting up and the footman busy now in putting down the rugs refused to wake him 
levin deliberately took out a ten rouble note and careful to speak slowly though losing no time over the business he handed him the note and explained that pyotr dmitrievitch what a great and important personage he seemed to levin now this pyotr dmitrievitch who had been of so little consequence in his eyes before  
had promised to come at any time that he would certainly not be angry 
and that he must therefore wake him at once 
the footman agreed and went upstairs taking levin into the waiting room 
levin could hear through the door the doctor coughing moving about washing and saying something 
three minutes passed it seemed to levin that more than an hour had gone by 
he could not wait any longer 
 pyotr dmitrievitch pyotr dmitrievitch  
he said in an imploring voice at the open door 
 for god s sake forgive me 
see me as you are 
it s been going on more than two hours already  
 in a minute in a minute  
answered a voice and to his amazement levin heard that the doctor was smiling as he spoke 
 for one instant  
 in a minute  
two minutes more passed while the doctor was putting on his boots and two minutes more while the doctor put on his coat and combed his hair 
 pyotr dmitrievitch  
levin was beginning again in a plaintive voice just as the doctor came in dressed and ready 
 these people have no conscience  thought levin 
 combing his hair while we re dying  
 good morning  
the doctor said to him shaking hands and as it were teasing him with his composure 
 there s no hurry 
well now  
trying to be as accurate as possible levin began to tell him every unnecessary detail of his wife s condition interrupting his account repeatedly with entreaties that the doctor would come with him at once 
 oh you needn t be in any hurry 
you don t understand you know 
i m certain i m not wanted still i ve promised and if you like i ll come 
but there s no hurry 
please sit down won t you have some coffee  
levin stared at him with eyes that asked whether he was laughing at him but the doctor had no notion of making fun of him 
 i know i know  the doctor said smiling i m a married man myself and at these moments we husbands are very much to be pitied 
i ve a patient whose husband always takes refuge in the stables on such occasions  
 but what do you think pyotr dmitrievitch 
do you suppose it may go all right  
 everything points to a favorable issue  
 so you ll come immediately  
said levin looking wrathfully at the servant who was bringing in the coffee 
 in an hour s time  
 oh for mercy s sake  
 well let me drink my coffee anyway  
the doctor started upon his coffee 
both were silent 
 the turks are really getting beaten though 
did you read yesterday s telegrams  
said the doctor munching some roll 
 no i can t stand it  
said levin jumping up 
 so you ll be with us in a quarter of an hour  
 in half an hour  
 on your honor  
when levin got home he drove up at the same time as the princess and they went up to the bedroom door together 
the princess had tears in her eyes and her hands were shaking 
seeing levin she embraced him and burst into tears 
 well my dear lizaveta petrovna  
she queried clasping the hand of the midwife who came out to meet them with a beaming and anxious face 
 she s going on well  she said persuade her to lie down 
she will be easier so  
from the moment when he had waked up and understood what was going on levin had prepared his mind to bear resolutely what was before him and without considering or anticipating anything to avoid upsetting his wife and on the contrary to soothe her and keep up her courage 
without allowing himself even to think of what was to come of how it would end judging from his inquiries as to the usual duration of these ordeals levin had in his imagination braced himself to bear up and to keep a tight rein on his feelings for five hours and it had seemed to him he could do this 
but when he came back from the doctor s and saw her sufferings again he fell to repeating more and more frequently lord have mercy on us and succor us  
he sighed and flung his head up and began to feel afraid he could not bear it that he would burst into tears or run away 
such agony it was to him 
and only one hour had passed 
but after that hour there passed another hour two hours three the full five hours he had fixed as the furthest limit of his sufferings and the position was still unchanged and he was still bearing it because there was nothing to be done but bear it every instant feeling that he had reached the utmost limits of his endurance and that his heart would break with sympathy and pain 
but still the minutes passed by and the hours and still hours more and his misery and horror grew and were more and more intense 
all the ordinary conditions of life without which one can form no conception of anything had ceased to exist for levin 
he lost all sense of time 
minutes  those minutes when she sent for him and he held her moist hand that would squeeze his hand with extraordinary violence and then push it away  seemed to him hours and hours seemed to him minutes 
he was surprised when lizaveta petrovna asked him to light a candle behind a screen and he found that it was five o clock in the afternoon 
if he had been told it was only ten o clock in the morning he would not have been more surprised 
where he was all this time he knew as little as the time of anything 
he saw her swollen face sometimes bewildered and in agony sometimes smiling and trying to reassure him 
he saw the old princess too flushed and overwrought with her gray curls in disorder forcing herself to gulp down her tears biting her lips he saw dolly too and the doctor smoking fat cigarettes and lizaveta petrovna with a firm resolute reassuring face and the old prince walking up and down the hall with a frowning face 
but why they came in and went out where they were he did not know 
the princess was with the doctor in the bedroom then in the study where a table set for dinner suddenly appeared then she was not there but dolly was 
then levin remembered he had been sent somewhere 
once he had been sent to move a table and sofa 
he had done this eagerly thinking it had to be done for her sake and only later on he found it was his own bed he had been getting ready 
then he had been sent to the study to ask the doctor something 
the doctor had answered and then had said something about the irregularities in the municipal council 
then he had been sent to the bedroom to help the old princess to move the holy picture in its silver and gold setting and with the princess s old waiting maid he had clambered on a shelf to reach it and had broken the little lamp and the old servant had tried to reassure him about the lamp and about his wife and he carried the holy picture and set it at kitty s head carefully tucking it in behind the pillow 
but where when and why all this had happened he could not tell 
he did not understand why the old princess took his hand and looking compassionately at him begged him not to worry himself and dolly persuaded him to eat something and led him out of the room and even the doctor looked seriously and with commiseration at him and offered him a drop of something 
all he knew and felt was that what was happening was what had happened nearly a year before in the hotel of the country town at the deathbed of his brother nikolay 
but that had been grief  this was joy 
yet that grief and this joy were alike outside all the ordinary conditions of life they were loop holes as it were in that ordinary life through which there came glimpses of something sublime 
and in the contemplation of this sublime something the soul was exalted to inconceivable heights of which it had before had no conception while reason lagged behind unable to keep up with it 
 lord have mercy on us and succor us  
he repeated to himself incessantly feeling in spite of his long and as it seemed complete alienation from religion that he turned to god just as trustfully and simply as he had in his childhood and first youth 
all this time he had two distinct spiritual conditions 
one was away from her with the doctor who kept smoking one fat cigarette after another and extinguishing them on the edge of a full ash tray with dolly and with the old prince where there was talk about dinner about politics about marya petrovna s illness and where levin suddenly forgot for a minute what was happening and felt as though he had waked up from sleep the other was in her presence at her pillow where his heart seemed breaking and still did not break from sympathetic suffering and he prayed to god without ceasing 
and every time he was brought back from a moment of oblivion by a scream reaching him from the bedroom he fell into the same strange terror that had come upon him the first minute 
every time he heard a shriek he jumped up ran to justify himself remembered on the way that he was not to blame and he longed to defend her to help her 
but as he looked at her he saw again that help was impossible and he was filled with terror and prayed lord have mercy on us and help us  
and as time went on both these conditions became more intense the calmer he became away from her completely forgetting her the more agonizing became both her sufferings and his feeling of helplessness before them 
he jumped up would have liked to run away but ran to her 
sometimes when again and again she called upon him he blamed her but seeing her patient smiling face and hearing the words i am worrying you  he threw the blame on god but thinking of god at once he fell to beseeching god to forgive him and have mercy 
chapter    he did not know whether it was late or early 
the candles had all burned out 
dolly had just been in the study and had suggested to the doctor that he should lie down 
levin sat listening to the doctor s stories of a quack mesmerizer and looking at the ashes of his cigarette 
there had been a period of repose and he had sunk into oblivion 
he had completely forgotten what was going on now 
he heard the doctor s chat and understood it 
suddenly there came an unearthly shriek 
the shriek was so awful that levin did not even jump up but holding his breath gazed in terrified inquiry at the doctor 
the doctor put his head on one side listened and smiled approvingly 
everything was so extraordinary that nothing could strike levin as strange 
 i suppose it must be so  he thought and still sat where he was 
whose scream was this 
he jumped up ran on tiptoe to the bedroom edged round lizaveta petrovna and the princess and took up his position at kitty s pillow 
the scream had subsided but there was some change now 
what it was he did not see and did not comprehend and he had no wish to see or comprehend 
but he saw it by the face of lizaveta petrovna 
lizaveta petrovna s face was stern and pale and still as resolute though her jaws were twitching and her eyes were fixed intently on kitty 
kitty s swollen and agonized face a tress of hair clinging to her moist brow was turned to him and sought his eyes 
her lifted hands asked for his hands 
clutching his chill hands in her moist ones she began squeezing them to her face 
 don t go don t go 
i m not afraid i m not afraid  
she said rapidly 
 mamma take my earrings 
they bother me 
you re not afraid 
quick quick lizaveta petrovna     she spoke quickly very quickly and tried to smile 
but suddenly her face was drawn she pushed him away 
 oh this is awful 
i m dying i m dying 
go away  
she shrieked and again he heard that unearthly scream 
levin clutched at his head and ran out of the room 
 it s nothing it s nothing it s all right  dolly called after him 
but they might say what they liked he knew now that all was over 
he stood in the next room his head leaning against the door post and heard shrieks howls such as he had never heard before and he knew that what had been kitty was uttering these shrieks 
he had long ago ceased to wish for the child 
by now he loathed this child 
he did not even wish for her life now all he longed for was the end of this awful anguish 
 doctor 
what is it 
what is it 
by god  
he said snatching at the doctor s hand as he came up 
 it s the end  said the doctor 
and the doctor s face was so grave as he said it that levin took  the end  as meaning her death 
beside himself he ran into the bedroom 
the first thing he saw was the face of lizaveta petrovna 
it was even more frowning and stern 
kitty s face he did not know 
in the place where it had been was something that was fearful in its strained distortion and in the sounds that came from it 
he fell down with his head on the wooden framework of the bed feeling that his heart was bursting 
the awful scream never paused it became still more awful and as though it had reached the utmost limit of terror suddenly it ceased 
levin could not believe his ears but there could be no doubt the scream had ceased and he heard a subdued stir and bustle and hurried breathing and her voice gasping alive tender and blissful uttered softly it s over  
he lifted his head 
with her hands hanging exhausted on the quilt looking extraordinarily lovely and serene she looked at him in silence and tried to smile and could not 
and suddenly from the mysterious and awful far away world in which he had been living for the last twenty two hours levin felt himself all in an instant borne back to the old every day world glorified though now by such a radiance of happiness that he could not bear it 
the strained chords snapped sobs and tears of joy which he had never foreseen rose up with such violence that his whole body shook that for long they prevented him from speaking 
falling on his knees before the bed he held his wife s hand before his lips and kissed it and the hand with a weak movement of the fingers responded to his kiss 
and meanwhile there at the foot of the bed in the deft hands of lizaveta petrovna like a flickering light in a lamp lay the life of a human creature which had never existed before and which would now with the same right with the same importance to itself live and create in its own image 
 alive 
alive 
and a boy too 
set your mind at rest  
levin heard lizaveta petrovna saying as she slapped the baby s back with a shaking hand 
 mamma is it true  
said kitty s voice 
the princess s sobs were all the answers she could make 
and in the midst of the silence there came in unmistakable reply to the mother s question a voice quite unlike the subdued voices speaking in the room 
it was the bold clamorous self assertive squall of the new human being who had so incomprehensibly appeared 
if levin had been told before that kitty was dead and that he had died with her and that their children were angels and that god was standing before him he would have been surprised at nothing 
but now coming back to the world of reality he had to make great mental efforts to take in that she was alive and well and that the creature squalling so desperately was his son 
kitty was alive her agony was over 
and he was unutterably happy 
that he understood he was completely happy in it 
but the baby 
whence why who was he    
he could not get used to the idea 
it seemed to him something extraneous superfluous to which he could not accustom himself 
chapter    at ten o clock the old prince sergey ivanovitch and stepan arkadyevitch were sitting at levin s 
having inquired after kitty they had dropped into conversation upon other subjects 
levin heard them and unconsciously as they talked going over the past over what had been up to that morning he thought of himself as he had been yesterday till that point 
it was as though a hundred years had passed since then 
he felt himself exalted to unattainable heights from which he studiously lowered himself so as not to wound the people he was talking to 
he talked and was all the time thinking of his wife of her condition now of his son in whose existence he tried to school himself into believing 
the whole world of woman which had taken for him since his marriage a new value he had never suspected before was now so exalted that he could not take it in in his imagination 
he heard them talk of yesterday s dinner at the club and thought what is happening with her now 
is she asleep 
how is she 
what is she thinking of 
is he crying my son dmitri  
and in the middle of the conversation in the middle of a sentence he jumped up and went out of the room 
 send me word if i can see her  said the prince 
 very well in a minute  answered levin and without stopping he went to her room 
she was not asleep she was talking gently with her mother making plans about the christening 
carefully set to rights with hair well brushed in a smart little cap with some blue in it her arms out on the quilt she was lying on her back 
meeting his eyes her eyes drew him to her 
her face bright before brightened still more as he drew near her 
there was the same change in it from earthly to unearthly that is seen in the face of the dead 
but then it means farewell here it meant welcome 
again a rush of emotion such as he had felt at the moment of the child s birth flooded his heart 
she took his hand and asked him if he had slept 
he could not answer and turned away struggling with his weakness 
 i have had a nap kostya  
she said to him and i am so comfortable now  
she looked at him but suddenly her expression changed 
 give him to me  she said hearing the baby s cry 
 give him to me lizaveta petrovna and he shall look at him  
 to be sure his papa shall look at him  said lizaveta petrovna getting up and bringing something red and queer and wriggling 
 wait a minute we ll make him tidy first  and lizaveta petrovna laid the red wobbling thing on the bed began untrussing and trussing up the baby lifting it up and turning it over with one finger and powdering it with something 
levin looking at the tiny pitiful creature made strenuous efforts to discover in his heart some traces of fatherly feeling for it 
he felt nothing towards it but disgust 
but when it was undressed and he caught a glimpse of wee wee little hands little feet saffron colored with little toes too and positively with a little big toe different from the rest and when he saw lizaveta petrovna closing the wide open little hands as though they were soft springs and putting them into linen garments such pity for the little creature came upon him and such terror that she would hurt it that he held her hand back 
lizaveta petrovna laughed 
 don t be frightened don t be frightened  
when the baby had been put to rights and transformed into a firm doll lizaveta petrovna dandled it as though proud of her handiwork and stood a little away so that levin might see his son in all his glory 
kitty looked sideways in the same direction never taking her eyes off the baby 
 give him to me 
give him to me  
she said and even made as though she would sit up 
 what are you thinking of katerina alexandrovna you mustn t move like that 
wait a minute 
i ll give him to you 
here we re showing papa what a fine fellow we are  
and lizaveta petrovna with one hand supporting the wobbling head lifted up on the other arm the strange limp red creature whose head was lost in its swaddling clothes 
but it had a nose too and slanting eyes and smacking lips 
 a splendid baby  
said lizaveta petrovna 
levin sighed with mortification 
this splendid baby excited in him no feeling but disgust and compassion 
it was not at all the feeling he had looked forward to 
he turned away while lizaveta petrovna put the baby to the unaccustomed breast 
suddenly laughter made him look round 
the baby had taken the breast 
 come that s enough that s enough  
said lizaveta petrovna but kitty would not let the baby go 
he fell asleep in her arms 
 look now  said kitty turning the baby so that he could see it 
the aged looking little face suddenly puckered up still more and the baby sneezed 
smiling hardly able to restrain his tears levin kissed his wife and went out of the dark room 
what he felt towards this little creature was utterly unlike what he had expected 
there was nothing cheerful and joyous in the feeling on the contrary it was a new torture of apprehension 
it was the consciousness of a new sphere of liability to pain 
and this sense was so painful at first the apprehension lest this helpless creature should suffer was so intense that it prevented him from noticing the strange thrill of senseless joy and even pride that he had felt when the baby sneezed 
chapter    stepan arkadyevitch s affairs were in a very bad way 
the money for two thirds of the forest had all been spent already and he had borrowed from the merchant in advance at ten per cent discount almost all the remaining third 
the  merchant would not give more especially as darya alexandrovna for the first time that winter insisting on her right to her own property had refused to sign the receipt for the payment of the last third of the forest 
all his salary went on household expenses and in payment of petty debts that could not be put off 
there was positively no money 
this was unpleasant and awkward and in stepan arkadyevitch s opinion things could not go on like this 
the explanation of the position was in his view to be found in the fact that his salary was too small 
the post he filled had been unmistakably very good five years ago but it was so no longer 
petrov the bank director had twelve thousand sventitsky a company director had seventeen thousand mitin who had founded a bank received fifty thousand 
 clearly i ve been napping and they ve overlooked me  stepan arkadyevitch thought about himself 
and he began keeping his eyes and ears open and towards the end of the winter he had discovered a very good berth and had formed a plan of attack upon it at first from moscow through aunts uncles and friends and then when the matter was well advanced in the spring he went himself to petersburg 
it was one of those snug lucrative berths of which there are so many more nowadays than there used to be with incomes ranging from one thousand to fifty thousand roubles 
it was the post of secretary of the committee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways and of certain banking companies 
this position like all such appointments called for such immense energy and such varied qualifications that it was difficult for them to be found united in any one man 
and since a man combining all the qualifications was not to be found it was at least better that the post be filled by an honest than by a dishonest man 
and stepan arkadyevitch was not merely an honest man  unemphatically  in the common acceptation of the words he was an honest man  emphatically  in that special sense which the word has in moscow when they talk of an honest politician an honest writer an honest newspaper an honest institution an honest tendency meaning not simply that the man or the institution is not dishonest but that they are capable on occasion of taking a line of their own in opposition to the authorities 
stepan arkadyevitch moved in those circles in moscow in which that expression had come into use was regarded there as an honest man and so had more right to this appointment than others 
the appointment yielded an income of from seven to ten thousand a year and oblonsky could fill it without giving up his government position 
it was in the hands of two ministers one lady and two jews and all these people though the way had been paved already with them stepan arkadyevitch had to see in petersburg 
besides this business stepan arkadyevitch had promised his sister anna to obtain from karenin a definite answer on the question of divorce 
and begging fifty roubles from dolly he set off for petersburg 
stepan arkadyevitch sat in karenin s study listening to his report on the causes of the unsatisfactory position of russian finance and only waiting for the moment when he would finish to speak about his own business or about anna 
 yes that s very true  he said when alexey alexandrovitch took off the pince nez without which he could not read now and looked inquiringly at his former brother in law that s very true in particular cases but still the principle of our day is freedom  
 yes but i lay down another principle embracing the principle of freedom  said alexey alexandrovitch with emphasis on the word embracing  and he put on his pince nez again so as to read the passage in which this statement was made 
and turning over the beautifully written wide margined manuscript alexey alexandrovitch read aloud over again the conclusive passage 
 i don t advocate protection for the sake of private interests but for the public weal and for the lower and upper classes equally  he said looking over his pince nez at oblonsky 
 but they  cannot grasp that  they  are taken up now with personal interests and carried away by phrases  
stepan arkadyevitch knew that when karenin began to talk of what they  were doing and thinking the persons who would not accept his report and were the cause of everything wrong in russia that it was coming near the end 
and so now he eagerly abandoned the principle of free trade and fully agreed 
alexey alexandrovitch paused thoughtfully turning over the pages of his manuscript 
 oh by the way  said stepan arkadyevitch i wanted to ask you some time when you see pomorsky to drop him a hint that i should be very glad to get that new appointment of secretary of the committee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways and banking companies  
stepan arkadyevitch was familiar by now with the title of the post he coveted and he brought it out rapidly without mistake 
alexey alexandrovitch questioned him as to the duties of this new committee and pondered 
he was considering whether the new committee would not be acting in some way contrary to the views he had been advocating 
but as the influence of the new committee was of a very complex nature and his views were of very wide application he could not decide this straight off and taking off his pince nez he said  of course i can mention it to him but what is your reason precisely for wishing to obtain the appointment  
 it s a good salary rising to nine thousand and my means     nine thousand  
repeated alexey alexandrovitch and he frowned 
the high figure of the salary made him reflect that on that side stepan arkadyevitch s proposed position ran counter to the main tendency of his own projects of reform which always leaned towards economy 
 i consider and i have embodied my views in a note on the subject that in our day these immense salaries are evidence of the unsound economic  assiette  of our finances  
 but what s to be done  
said stepan arkadyevitch 
 suppose a bank director gets ten thousand  well he s worth it or an engineer gets twenty thousand  after all it s a growing thing you know  
 i assume that a salary is the price paid for a commodity and it ought to conform with the law of supply and demand 
if the salary is fixed without any regard for that law as for instance when i see two engineers leaving college together both equally well trained and efficient and one getting forty thousand while the other is satisfied with two or when i see lawyers and hussars having no special qualifications appointed directors of banking companies with immense salaries i conclude that the salary is not fixed in accordance with the law of supply and demand but simply through personal interest 
and this is an abuse of great gravity in itself and one that reacts injuriously on the government service 
i consider     stepan arkadyevitch made haste to interrupt his brother in law 
 yes but you must agree that it s a new institution of undoubted utility that s being started 
after all you know it s a growing thing 
what they lay particular stress on is the thing being carried on honestly  said stepan arkadyevitch with emphasis 
but the moscow significance of the word honest was lost on alexey alexandrovitch 
 honesty is only a negative qualification  he said 
 well you ll do me a great service anyway  said stepan arkadyevitch by putting in a word to pomorsky  just in the way of conversation      but i fancy it s more in volgarinov s hands  said alexey alexandrovitch 
 volgarinov has fully assented as far as he s concerned  said stepan arkadyevitch turning red 
stepan arkadyevitch reddened at the mention of that name because he had been that morning at the jew volgarinov s and the visit had left an unpleasant recollection 
stepan arkadyevitch believed most positively that the committee in which he was trying to get an appointment was a new genuine and honest public body but that morning when volgarinov had  intentionally beyond a doubt  kept him two hours waiting with other petitioners in his waiting room he had suddenly felt uneasy 
whether he was uncomfortable that he a descendant of rurik prince oblonsky had been kept for two hours waiting to see a jew or that for the first time in his life he was not following the example of his ancestors in serving the government but was turning off into a new career anyway he was very uncomfortable 
during those two hours in volgarinov s waiting room stepan arkadyevitch stepping jauntily about the room pulling his whiskers entering into conversation with the other petitioners and inventing an epigram on his position assiduously concealed from others and even from himself the feeling he was experiencing 
but all the time he was uncomfortable and angry he could not have said why  whether because he could not get his epigram just right or from some other reason 
when at last volgarinov had received him with exaggerated politeness and unmistakable triumph at his humiliation and had all but refused the favor asked of him stepan arkadyevitch had made haste to forget it all as soon as possible 
and now at the mere recollection he blushed 
chapter    now there is something i want to talk about and you know what it is 
about anna  stepan arkadyevitch said pausing for a brief space and shaking off the unpleasant impression 
as soon as oblonsky uttered anna s name the face of alexey alexandrovitch was completely transformed all the life was gone out of it and it looked weary and dead 
 what is it exactly that you want from me  
he said moving in his chair and snapping his pince nez 
 a definite settlement alexey alexandrovitch some settlement of the position 
i m appealing to you  not as an injured husband  stepan arkadyevitch was going to say but afraid of wrecking his negotiation by this he changed the words not as a statesman which did not sound  à propos  but simply as a man and a good hearted man and a christian 
you must have pity on her  he said 
 that is in what way precisely  
karenin said softly 
 yes pity on her 
if you had seen her as i have   i have been spending all the winter with her  you would have pity on her 
her position is awful simply awful  
 i had imagined  answered alexey alexandrovitch in a higher almost shrill voice that anna arkadyevna had everything she had desired for herself  
 oh alexey alexandrovitch for heaven s sake don t let us indulge in recriminations 
what is past is past and you know what she wants and is waiting for  divorce  
 but i believe anna arkadyevna refuses a divorce if i make it a condition to leave me my son 
i replied in that sense and supposed that the matter was ended 
i consider it at an end  shrieked alexey alexandrovitch 
 but for heaven s sake don t get hot  
said stepan arkadyevitch touching his brother in law s knee 
 the matter is not ended 
if you will allow me to recapitulate it was like this when you parted you were as magnanimous as could possibly be you were ready to give her everything  freedom divorce even 
she appreciated that 
no don t think that 
she did appreciate it  to such a degree that at the first moment feeling how she had wronged you she did not consider and could not consider everything 
she gave up everything 
but experience time have shown that her position is unbearable impossible  
 the life of anna arkadyevna can have no interest for me  alexey alexandrovitch put in lifting his eyebrows 
 allow me to disbelieve that  stepan arkadyevitch replied gently 
 her position is intolerable for her and of no benefit to anyone whatever 
she has deserved it you will say 
she knows that and asks you for nothing she says plainly that she dare not ask you 
but i all of us her relatives all who love her beg you entreat you 
why should she suffer 
who is any the better for it  
 excuse me you seem to put me in the position of the guilty party  observed alexey alexandrovitch 
 oh no oh no not at all 
please understand me  said stepan arkadyevitch touching his hand again as though feeling sure this physical contact would soften his brother in law 
 all i say is this her position is intolerable and it might be alleviated by you and you will lose nothing by it 
i will arrange it all for you so that you ll not notice it 
you did promise it you know  
 the promise was given before 
and i had supposed that the question of my son had settled the matter 
besides i had hoped that anna arkadyevna had enough generosity    alexey alexandrovitch articulated with difficulty his lips twitching and his face white 
 she leaves it all to your generosity 
she begs she implores one thing of you  to extricate her from the impossible position in which she is placed 
she does not ask for her son now 
alexey alexandrovitch you are a good man 
put yourself in her position for a minute 
the question of divorce for her in her position is a question of life and death 
if you had not promised it once she would have reconciled herself to her position she would have gone on living in the country 
but you promised it and she wrote to you and moved to moscow 
and here she s been for six months in moscow where every chance meeting cuts her to the heart every day expecting an answer 
why it s like keeping a condemned criminal for six months with the rope round his neck promising him perhaps death perhaps mercy 
have pity on her and i will undertake to arrange everything 
vos scrupules     i am not talking about that about that    alexey alexandrovitch interrupted with disgust 
 but perhaps i promised what i had no right to promise  
 so you go back from your promise  
 i have never refused to do all that is possible but i want time to consider how much of what i promised is possible  
 no alexey alexandrovitch  
cried oblonsky jumping up i won t believe that 
she s unhappy as only an unhappy woman can be and you cannot refuse in such     as much of what i promised as is possible 
vous professez d être libre penseur 
but i as a believer cannot in a matter of such gravity act in opposition to the christian law  
 but in christian societies and among us as far as i m aware divorce is allowed  said stepan arkadyevitch 
 divorce is sanctioned even by our church 
and we see     it is allowed but not in the sense     alexey alexandrovitch you are not like yourself  said oblonsky after a brief pause 
 wasn t it you and didn t we all appreciate it in you  
who forgave everything and moved simply by christian feeling was ready to make any sacrifice 
you said yourself if a man take thy coat give him thy cloak also and now     i beg  said alexey alexandrovitch shrilly getting suddenly onto his feet his face white and his jaws twitching i beg you to drop this   to drop   this subject  
 oh no 
oh forgive me forgive me if i have wounded you  said stepan arkadyevitch holding out his hand with a smile of embarrassment but like a messenger i have simply performed the commission given me  
alexey alexandrovitch gave him his hand pondered a little and said  i must think it over and seek for guidance 
the day after tomorrow i will give you a final answer  he said after considering a moment 
chapter    stepan arkadyevitch was about to go away when korney came in to announce  sergey alexyevitch  
 who s sergey alexyevitch  
stepan arkadyevitch was beginning but he remembered immediately 
 ah seryozha  
he said aloud 
 sergey alexyevitch 
i thought it was the director of a department 
anna asked me to see him too  he thought 
and he recalled the timid piteous expression with which anna had said to him at parting anyway you will see him 
find out exactly where he is who is looking after him 
and stiva   if it were possible 
could it be possible  
stepan arkadyevitch knew what was meant by that if it were possible    if it were possible to arrange the divorce so as to let her have her son    stepan arkadyevitch saw now that it was no good to dream of that but still he was glad to see his nephew 
alexey alexandrovitch reminded his brother in law that they never spoke to the boy of his mother and he begged him not to mention a single word about her 
 he was very ill after that interview with his mother which we had not foreseen  said alexey alexandrovitch 
 indeed we feared for his life 
but with rational treatment and sea bathing in the summer he regained his strength and now by the doctor s advice i have let him go to school 
and certainly the companionship of school has had a good effect on him and he is perfectly well and making good progress  
 what a fine fellow he s grown 
he s not seryozha now but quite full fledged sergey alexyevitch  
said stepan arkadyevitch smiling as he looked at the handsome broad shouldered lad in blue coat and long trousers who walked in alertly and confidently 
the boy looked healthy and good humored 
he bowed to his uncle as to a stranger but recognizing him he blushed and turned hurriedly away from him as though offended and irritated at something 
the boy went up to his father and handed him a note of the marks he had gained in school 
 well that s very fair  said his father you can go  
 he s thinner and taller and has grown out of being a child into a boy i like that  said stepan arkadyevitch 
 do you remember me  
the boy looked back quickly at his uncle 
 yes  mon oncle  he answered glancing at his father and again he looked downcast 
his uncle called him to him and took his hand 
 well and how are you getting on  
he said wanting to talk to him and not knowing what to say 
the boy blushing and making no answer cautiously drew his hand away 
as soon as stepan arkadyevitch let go his hand he glanced doubtfully at his father and like a bird set free he darted out of the room 
a year had passed since the last time seryozha had seen his mother 
since then he had heard nothing more of her 
and in the course of that year he had gone to school and made friends among his schoolfellows 
the dreams and memories of his mother which had made him ill after seeing her did not occupy his thoughts now 
when they came back to him he studiously drove them away regarding them as shameful and girlish below the dignity of a boy and a schoolboy 
he knew that his father and mother were separated by some quarrel he knew that he had to remain with his father and he tried to get used to that idea 
he disliked seeing his uncle so like his mother for it called up those memories of which he was ashamed 
he disliked it all the more as from some words he had caught as he waited at the study door and still more from the faces of his father and uncle he guessed that they must have been talking of his mother 
and to avoid condemning the father with whom he lived and on whom he was dependent and above all to avoid giving way to sentimentality which he considered so degrading seryozha tried not to look at his uncle who had come to disturb his peace of mind and not to think of what he recalled to him 
but when stepan arkadyevitch going out after him saw him on the stairs and calling to him asked him how he spent his playtime at school seryozha talked more freely to him away from his father s presence 
 we have a railway now  he said in answer to his uncle s question 
 it s like this do you see two sit on a bench  they re the passengers and one stands up straight on the bench 
and all are harnessed to it by their arms or by their belts and they run through all the rooms  the doors are left open beforehand 
well and it s pretty hard work being the conductor  
 that s the one that stands  
stepan arkadyevitch inquired smiling 
 yes you want pluck for it and cleverness too especially when they stop all of a sudden or someone falls down  
 yes that must be a serious matter  said stepan arkadyevitch watching with mournful interest the eager eyes like his mother s not childish now  no longer fully innocent 
and though he had promised alexey alexandrovitch not to speak of anna he could not restrain himself 
 do you remember your mother  
he asked suddenly 
 no i don t  seryozha said quickly 
he blushed crimson and his face clouded over 
and his uncle could get nothing more out of him 
his tutor found his pupil on the staircase half an hour later and for a long while he could not make out whether he was ill tempered or crying 
 what is it 
i expect you hurt yourself when you fell down  
said the tutor 
 i told you it was a dangerous game 
and we shall have to speak to the director  
 if i had hurt myself nobody should have found it out that s certain  
 well what is it then  
 leave me alone 
if i remember or if i don t remember    what business is it of his 
why should i remember 
leave me in peace  
he said addressing not his tutor but the whole world 
chapter    stepan arkadyevitch as usual did not waste his time in petersburg 
in petersburg besides business his sister s divorce and his coveted appointment he wanted as he always did to freshen himself up as he said after the mustiness of moscow 
in spite of its  cafés chantants  and its omnibuses moscow was yet a stagnant bog 
stepan arkadyevitch always felt it 
after living for some time in moscow especially in close relations with his family he was conscious of a depression of spirits 
after being a long time in moscow without a change he reached a point when he positively began to be worrying himself over his wife s ill humor and reproaches over his children s health and education and the petty details of his official work even the fact of being in debt worried him 
but he had only to go and stay a little while in petersburg in the circle there in which he moved where people lived  really lived  instead of vegetating as in moscow and all such ideas vanished and melted away at once like wax before the fire 
his wife    
only that day he had been talking to prince tchetchensky 
prince tchetchensky had a wife and family grown up pages in the corps    and he had another illegitimate family of children also 
though the first family was very nice too prince tchetchensky felt happier in his second family and he used to take his eldest son with him to his second family and told stepan arkadyevitch that he thought it good for his son enlarging his ideas 
what would have been said to that in moscow 
his children 
in petersburg children did not prevent their parents from enjoying life 
the children were brought up in schools and there was no trace of the wild idea that prevailed in moscow in lvov s household for instance that all the luxuries of life were for the children while the parents have nothing but work and anxiety 
here people understood that a man is in duty bound to live for himself as every man of culture should live 
his official duties 
official work here was not the stiff hopeless drudgery that it was in moscow 
here there was some interest in official life 
a chance meeting a service rendered a happy phrase a knack of facetious mimicry and a man s career might be made in a trice 
so it had been with bryantsev whom stepan arkadyevitch had met the previous day and who was one of the highest functionaries in government now 
there was some interest in official work like that 
the petersburg attitude on pecuniary matters had an especially soothing effect on stepan arkadyevitch 
bartnyansky who must spend at least fifty thousand to judge by the style he lived in had made an interesting comment the day before on that subject 
as they were talking before dinner stepan arkadyevitch said to bartnyansky  you re friendly i fancy with mordvinsky you might do me a favor say a word to him please for me 
there s an appointment i should like to get  secretary of the agency     oh i shan t remember all that if you tell it to me    
but what possesses you to have to do with railways and jews    
take it as you will it s a low business  
stepan arkadyevitch did not say to bartnyansky that it was a growing thing   bartnyansky would not have understood that 
 i want the money i ve nothing to live on  
 you re living aren t you  
 yes but in debt  
 are you though 
heavily  
said bartnyansky sympathetically 
 very heavily twenty thousand  
bartnyansky broke into good humored laughter 
 oh lucky fellow  
said he 
 my debts mount up to a million and a half and i ve nothing and still i can live as you see  
and stepan arkadyevitch saw the correctness of this view not in words only but in actual fact 
zhivahov owed three hundred thousand and hadn t a farthing to bless himself with and he lived and in style too 
count krivtsov was considered a hopeless case by everyone and yet he kept two mistresses 
petrovsky had run through five millions and still lived in just the same style and was even a manager in the financial department with a salary of twenty thousand 
but besides this petersburg had physically an agreeable effect on stepan arkadyevitch 
it made him younger 
in moscow he sometimes found a gray hair in his head dropped asleep after dinner stretched walked slowly upstairs breathing heavily was bored by the society of young women and did not dance at balls 
in petersburg he always felt ten years younger 
his experience in petersburg was exactly what had been described to him on the previous day by prince pyotr oblonsky a man of sixty who had just come back from abroad  we don t know the way to live here  said pyotr oblonsky 
 i spent the summer in baden and you wouldn t believe it i felt quite a young man 
at a glimpse of a pretty woman my thoughts     one dines and drinks a glass of wine and feels strong and ready for anything 
i came home to russia  had to see my wife and what s more go to my country place and there you d hardly believe it in a fortnight i d got into a dressing gown and given up dressing for dinner 
needn t say i had no thoughts left for pretty women 
i became quite an old gentleman 
there was nothing left for me but to think of my eternal salvation 
i went off to paris  i was as right as could be at once  
stepan arkadyevitch felt exactly the difference that pyotr oblonsky described 
in moscow he degenerated so much that if he had had to be there for long together he might in good earnest have come to considering his salvation in petersburg he felt himself a man of the world again 
between princess betsy tverskaya and stepan arkadyevitch there had long existed rather curious relations 
stepan arkadyevitch always flirted with her in jest and used to say to her also in jest the most unseemly things knowing that nothing delighted her so much 
the day after his conversation with karenin stepan arkadyevitch went to see her and felt so youthful that in this jesting flirtation and nonsense he recklessly went so far that he did not know how to extricate himself as unluckily he was so far from being attracted by her that he thought her positively disagreeable 
what made it hard to change the conversation was the fact that he was very attractive to her 
so that he was considerably relieved at the arrival of princess myakaya which cut short their  tête à tête 
 ah so you re here  
said she when she saw him 
 well and what news of your poor sister 
you needn t look at me like that  she added 
 ever since they ve all turned against her all those who re a thousand times worse than she i ve thought she did a very fine thing 
i can t forgive vronsky for not letting me know when she was in petersburg 
i d have gone to see her and gone about with her everywhere 
please give her my love 
come tell me about her  
 yes her position is very difficult she    began stepan arkadyevitch in the simplicity of his heart accepting as sterling coin princess myakaya s words tell me about her  
princess myakaya interrupted him immediately as she always did and began talking herself 
 she s done what they all do except me  only they hide it 
but she wouldn t be deceitful and she did a fine thing 
and she did better still in throwing up that crazy brother in law of yours 
you must excuse me 
everybody used to say he was so clever so very clever i was the only one that said he was a fool 
now that he s so thick with lidia ivanovna and landau they all say he s crazy and i should prefer not to agree with everybody but this time i can t help it  
 oh do please explain  said stepan arkadyevitch what does it mean 
yesterday i was seeing him on my sister s behalf and i asked him to give me a final answer 
he gave me no answer and said he would think it over 
but this morning instead of an answer i received an invitation from countess lidia ivanovna for this evening  
 ah so that s it that s it  
said princess myakaya gleefully they re going to ask landau what he s to say  
 ask landau 
what for 
who or what s landau  
 what 
you don t know jules landau  le fameux jules landau le clairvoyant 
he s crazy too but on him your sister s fate depends 
see what comes of living in the provinces  you know nothing about anything 
landau do you see was a  commis  in a shop in paris and he went to a doctor s and in the doctor s waiting room he fell asleep and in his sleep he began giving advice to all the patients 
and wonderful advice it was 
then the wife of yury meledinsky  you know the invalid   heard of this landau and had him to see her husband 
and he cured her husband though i can t say that i see he did him much good for he s just as feeble a creature as ever he was but they believed in him and took him along with them and brought him to russia 
here there s been a general rush to him and he s begun doctoring everyone 
he cured countess bezzubova and she took such a fancy to him that she adopted him  
 adopted him  
 yes as her son 
he s not landau any more now but count bezzubov 
that s neither here nor there though but lidia  i m very fond of her but she has a screw loose somewhere  has lost her heart to this landau now and nothing is settled now in her house or alexey alexandrovitch s without him and so your sister s fate is now in the hands of landau  alias  count bezzubov  
chapter    after a capital dinner and a great deal of cognac drunk at bartnyansky s stepan arkadyevitch only a little later than the appointed time went in to countess lidia ivanovna s 
 who else is with the countess   a frenchman  
stepan arkadyevitch asked the hall porter as he glanced at the familiar overcoat of alexey alexandrovitch and a queer rather artless looking overcoat with clasps 
 alexey alexandrovitch karenin and count bezzubov  the porter answered severely 
 princess myakaya guessed right  thought stepan arkadyevitch as he went upstairs 
 curious 
it would be quite as well though to get on friendly terms with her 
she has immense influence 
if she would say a word to pomorsky the thing would be a certainty  
it was still quite light out of doors but in countess lidia ivanovna s little drawing room the blinds were drawn and the lamps lighted 
at a round table under a lamp sat the countess and alexey alexandrovitch talking softly 
a short thinnish man very pale and handsome with feminine hips and knock kneed legs with fine brilliant eyes and long hair lying on the collar of his coat was standing at the end of the room gazing at the portraits on the wall 
after greeting the lady of the house and alexey alexandrovitch stepan arkadyevitch could not resist glancing once more at the unknown man 
 monsieur landau  
the countess addressed him with a softness and caution that impressed oblonsky 
and she introduced them 
landau looked round hurriedly came up and smiling laid his moist lifeless hand in stepan arkadyevitch s outstretched hand and immediately walked away and fell to gazing at the portraits again 
the countess and alexey alexandrovitch looked at each other significantly 
 i am very glad to see you particularly today  said countess lidia ivanovna pointing stepan arkadyevitch to a seat beside karenin 
 i introduced you to him as landau  she said in a soft voice glancing at the frenchman and again immediately after at alexey alexandrovitch but he is really count bezzubov as you re probably aware 
only he does not like the title  
 yes i heard so  answered stepan arkadyevitch they say he completely cured countess bezzubova  
 she was here today poor thing  
the countess said turning to alexey alexandrovitch 
 this separation is awful for her 
it s such a blow to her  
 and he positively is going  
queried alexey alexandrovitch 
 yes he s going to paris 
he heard a voice yesterday  said countess lidia ivanovna looking at stepan arkadyevitch 
 ah a voice  
repeated oblonsky feeling that he must be as circumspect as he possibly could in this society where something peculiar was going on or was to go on to which he had not the key 
a moment s silence followed after which countess lidia ivanovna as though approaching the main topic of conversation said with a fine smile to oblonsky  i ve known you for a long while and am very glad to make a closer acquaintance with you 
les amis de nos amis sont nos amis 
but to be a true friend one must enter into the spiritual state of one s friend and i fear that you are not doing so in the case of alexey alexandrovitch 
you understand what i mean  
she said lifting her fine pensive eyes 
 in part countess i understand the position of alexey alexandrovitch    said oblonsky 
having no clear idea what they were talking about he wanted to confine himself to generalities 
 the change is not in his external position  countess lidia ivanovna said sternly following with eyes of love the figure of alexey alexandrovitch as he got up and crossed over to landau his heart is changed a new heart has been vouchsafed him and i fear you don t fully apprehend the change that has taken place in him  
 oh well in general outlines i can conceive the change 
we have always been friendly and now    said stepan arkadyevitch responding with a sympathetic glance to the expression of the countess and mentally balancing the question with which of the two ministers she was most intimate so as to know about which to ask her to speak for him 
 the change that has taken place in him cannot lessen his love for his neighbors on the contrary that change can only intensify love in his heart 
but i am afraid you do not understand me 
won t you have some tea  
she said with her eyes indicating the footman who was handing round tea on a tray 
 not quite countess 
of course his misfortune     yes a misfortune which has proved the highest happiness when his heart was made new was filled full of it  she said gazing with eyes full of love at stepan arkadyevitch 
 i do believe i might ask her to speak to both of them  thought stepan arkadyevitch 
 oh of course countess  he said but i imagine such changes are a matter so private that no one even the most intimate friend would care to speak of them  
 on the contrary 
we ought to speak freely and help one another  
 yes undoubtedly so but there is such a difference of convictions and besides    said oblonsky with a soft smile 
 there can be no difference where it is a question of holy truth  
 oh no of course but    and stepan arkadyevitch paused in confusion 
he understood at last that they were talking of religion 
 i fancy he will fall asleep immediately  said alexey alexandrovitch in a whisper full of meaning going up to lidia ivanovna 
stepan arkadyevitch looked round 
landau was sitting at the window leaning on his elbow and the back of his chair his head drooping 
noticing that all eyes were turned on him he raised his head and smiled a smile of childlike artlessness 
 don t take any notice  said lidia ivanovna and she lightly moved a chair up for alexey alexandrovitch 
 i have observed    she was beginning when a footman came into the room with a letter 
lidia ivanovna rapidly ran her eyes over the note and excusing herself wrote an answer with extraordinary rapidity handed it to the man and came back to the table 
 i have observed  she went on that moscow people especially the men are more indifferent to religion than anyone  
 oh no countess i thought moscow people had the reputation of being the firmest in the faith  answered stepan arkadyevitch 
 but as far as i can make out you are unfortunately one of the indifferent ones  said alexey alexandrovitch turning to him with a weary smile 
 how anyone can be indifferent  
said lidia ivanovna 
 i am not so much indifferent on that subject as i am waiting in suspense  said stepan arkadyevitch with his most deprecating smile 
 i hardly think that the time for such questions has come yet for me  
alexey alexandrovitch and lidia ivanovna looked at each other 
 we can never tell whether the time has come for us or not  said alexey alexandrovitch severely 
 we ought not to think whether we are ready or not ready 
god s grace is not guided by human considerations sometimes it comes not to those that strive for it and comes to those that are unprepared like saul  
 no i believe it won t be just yet  said lidia ivanovna who had been meanwhile watching the movements of the frenchman 
landau got up and came to them 
 do you allow me to listen  
he asked 
 oh yes i did not want to disturb you  said lidia ivanovna gazing tenderly at him sit here with us  
 one has only not to close one s eyes to shut out the light  alexey alexandrovitch went on 
 ah if you knew the happiness we know feeling his presence ever in our hearts  
said countess lidia ivanovna with a rapturous smile 
 but a man may feel himself unworthy sometimes to rise to that height  said stepan arkadyevitch conscious of hypocrisy in admitting this religious height but at the same time unable to bring himself to acknowledge his free thinking views before a person who by a single word to pomorsky might procure him the coveted appointment 
 that is you mean that sin keeps him back  
said lidia ivanovna 
 but that is a false idea 
there is no sin for believers their sin has been atoned for 
pardon  she added looking at the footman who came in again with another letter 
she read it and gave a verbal answer tomorrow at the grand duchess s say  
 for the believer sin is not  she went on 
 yes but faith without works is dead  said stepan arkadyevitch recalling the phrase from the catechism and only by his smile clinging to his independence 
 there you have it  from the epistle of st james  said alexey alexandrovitch addressing lidia ivanovna with a certain reproachfulness in his tone 
it was unmistakably a subject they had discussed more than once before 
 what harm has been done by the false interpretation of that passage 
nothing holds men back from belief like that misinterpretation 
 i have not works so i cannot believe  though all the while that is not said 
but the very opposite is said  
 striving for god saving the soul by fasting  said countess lidia ivanovna with disgusted contempt those are the crude ideas of our monks    
yet that is nowhere said 
it is far simpler and easier  she added looking at oblonsky with the same encouraging smile with which at court she encouraged youthful maids of honor disconcerted by the new surroundings of the court 
 we are saved by christ who suffered for us 
we are saved by faith  alexey alexandrovitch chimed in with a glance of approval at her words 
 vous comprenez l anglais  
asked lidia ivanovna and receiving a reply in the affirmative she got up and began looking through a shelf of books 
 i want to read him safe and happy  or under the wing   she said looking inquiringly at karenin 
and finding the book and sitting down again in her place she opened it 
 it s very short 
in it is described the way by which faith can be reached and the happiness above all earthly bliss with which it fills the soul 
the believer cannot be unhappy because he is not alone 
but you will see  
she was just settling herself to read when the footman came in again 
 madame borozdina 
tell her tomorrow at two o clock 
yes  she said putting her finger in the place in the book and gazing before her with her fine pensive eyes that is how true faith acts 
you know marie sanina 
you know about her trouble 
she lost her only child 
she was in despair 
and what happened 
she found this comforter and she thanks god now for the death of her child 
such is the happiness faith brings  
 oh yes that is most    said stepan arkadyevitch glad they were going to read and let him have a chance to collect his faculties 
 no i see i d better not ask her about anything today  he thought 
 if only i can get out of this without putting my foot in it  
 it will be dull for you  said countess lidia ivanovna addressing landau you don t know english but it s short  
 oh i shall understand  said landau with the same smile and he closed his eyes 
alexey alexandrovitch and lidia ivanovna exchanged meaningful glances and the reading began 
chapter    stepan arkadyevitch felt completely nonplussed by the strange talk which he was hearing for the first time 
the complexity of petersburg as a rule had a stimulating effect on him rousing him out of his moscow stagnation 
but he liked these complications and understood them only in the circles he knew and was at home in 
in these unfamiliar surroundings he was puzzled and disconcerted and could not get his bearings 
as he listened to countess lidia ivanovna aware of the beautiful artless  or perhaps artful he could not decide which  eyes of landau fixed upon him stepan arkadyevitch began to be conscious of a peculiar heaviness in his head 
the most incongruous ideas were in confusion in his head 
 marie sanina is glad her child s dead     how good a smoke would be now    
to be saved one need only believe and the monks don t know how the thing s to be done but countess lidia ivanovna does know     and why is my head so heavy 
is it the cognac or all this being so queer 
anyway i fancy i ve done nothing unsuitable so far 
but anyway it won t do to ask her now 
they say they make one say one s prayers 
i only hope they won t make me 
that ll be too imbecile 
and what stuff it is she s reading 
but she has a good accent 
landau  bezzubov  what s he bezzubov for  
all at once stepan arkadyevitch became aware that his lower jaw was uncontrollably forming a yawn 
he pulled his whiskers to cover the yawn and shook himself together 
but soon after he became aware that he was dropping asleep and on the very point of snoring 
he recovered himself at the very moment when the voice of countess lidia ivanovna was saying he s asleep  
stepan arkadyevitch started with dismay feeling guilty and caught 
but he was reassured at once by seeing that the words he s asleep referred not to him but to landau 
the frenchman was asleep as well as stepan arkadyevitch 
but stepan arkadyevitch s being asleep would have offended them as he thought though even this he thought might not be so as everything seemed so queer  while landau s being asleep delighted them extremely especially countess lidia ivanovna 
 mon ami   said lidia ivanovna carefully holding the folds of her silk gown so as not to rustle and in her excitement calling karenin not alexey alexandrovitch but  mon ami  donnez lui la main 
vous voyez 
sh  
she hissed at the footman as he came in again 
 not at home  
the frenchman was asleep or pretending to be asleep with his head on the back of his chair and his moist hand as it lay on his knee made faint movements as though trying to catch something 
alexey alexandrovitch got up tried to move carefully but stumbled against the table went up and laid his hand in the frenchman s hand 
stepan arkadyevitch got up too and opening his eyes wide trying to wake himself up if he were asleep he looked first at one and then at the other 
it was all real 
stepan arkadyevitch felt that his head was getting worse and worse 
 que la personne qui est arrivee la derniere celle qui demande qu elle sorte 
qu elle sorte  
articulated the frenchman without opening his eyes 
 vous m excuserez mais vous voyez     revenez vers dix heures encore mieux demain  
 qu elle sorte  
repeated the frenchman impatiently 
 c est moi n est ce pas  
and receiving an answer in the affirmative stepan arkadyevitch forgetting the favor he had meant to ask of lidia ivanovna and forgetting his sister s affairs caring for nothing but filled with the sole desire to get away as soon as possible went out on tiptoe and ran out into the street as though from a plague stricken house 
for a long while he chatted and joked with his cab driver trying to recover his spirits 
at the french theater where he arrived for the last act and afterwards at the tatar restaurant after his champagne stepan arkadyevitch felt a little refreshed in the atmosphere he was used to 
but still he felt quite unlike himself all that evening 
on getting home to pyotr oblonsky s where he was staying stepan arkadyevitch found a note from betsy 
she wrote to him that she was very anxious to finish their interrupted conversation and begged him to come next day 
he had scarcely read this note and frowned at its contents when he heard below the ponderous tramp of the servants carrying something heavy 
stepan arkadyevitch went out to look 
it was the rejuvenated pyotr oblonsky 
he was so drunk that he could not walk upstairs but he told them to set him on his legs when he saw stepan arkadyevitch and clinging to him walked with him into his room and there began telling him how he had spent the evening and fell asleep doing so 
stepan arkadyevitch was in very low spirits which happened rarely with him and for a long while he could not go to sleep 
everything he could recall to his mind everything was disgusting but most disgusting of all as if it were something shameful was the memory of the evening he had spent at countess lidia ivanovna s 
next day he received from alexey alexandrovitch a final answer refusing to grant anna s divorce and he understood that this decision was based on what the frenchman had said in his real or pretended trance 
chapter    in order to carry through any undertaking in family life there must necessarily be either complete division between the husband and wife or loving agreement 
when the relations of a couple are vacillating and neither one thing nor the other no sort of enterprise can be undertaken 
many families remain for years in the same place though both husband and wife are sick of it simply because there is neither complete division nor agreement between them 
both vronsky and anna felt life in moscow insupportable in the heat and dust when the spring sunshine was followed by the glare of summer and all the trees in the boulevards had long since been in full leaf and the leaves were covered with dust 
but they did not go back to vozdvizhenskoe as they had arranged to do long before they went on staying in moscow though they both loathed it because of late there had been no agreement between them 
the irritability that kept them apart had no external cause and all efforts to come to an understanding intensified it instead of removing it 
it was an inner irritation grounded in her mind on the conviction that his love had grown less in his on regret that he had put himself for her sake in a difficult position which she instead of lightening made still more difficult 
neither of them gave full utterance to their sense of grievance but they considered each other in the wrong and tried on every pretext to prove this to one another 
in her eyes the whole of him with all his habits ideas desires with all his spiritual and physical temperament was one thing  love for women and that love she felt ought to be entirely concentrated on her alone 
that love was less consequently as she reasoned he must have transferred part of his love to other women or to another woman  and she was jealous 
she was jealous not of any particular woman but of the decrease of his love 
not having got an object for her jealousy she was on the lookout for it 
at the slightest hint she transferred her jealousy from one object to another 
at one time she was jealous of those low women with whom he might so easily renew his old bachelor ties then she was jealous of the society women he might meet then she was jealous of the imaginary girl whom he might want to marry for whose sake he would break with her 
and this last form of jealousy tortured her most of all especially as he had unwarily told her in a moment of frankness that his mother knew him so little that she had had the audacity to try and persuade him to marry the young princess sorokina 
and being jealous of him anna was indignant against him and found grounds for indignation in everything 
for everything that was difficult in her position she blamed him 
the agonizing condition of suspense she had passed in moscow the tardiness and indecision of alexey alexandrovitch her solitude  she put it all down to him 
if he had loved her he would have seen all the bitterness of her position and would have rescued her from it 
for her being in moscow and not in the country he was to blame too 
he could not live buried in the country as she would have liked to do 
he must have society and he had put her in this awful position the bitterness of which he would not see 
and again it was his fault that she was forever separated from her son 
even the rare moments of tenderness that came from time to time did not soothe her in his tenderness now she saw a shade of complacency of self confidence which had not been of old and which exasperated her 
it was dusk 
anna was alone and waiting for him to come back from a bachelor dinner 
she walked up and down in his study the room where the noise from the street was least heard  and thought over every detail of their yesterday s quarrel 
going back from the well remembered offensive words of the quarrel to what had been the ground of it she arrived at last at its origin 
for a long while she could hardly believe that their dissension had arisen from a conversation so inoffensive of so little moment to either 
but so it actually had been 
it all arose from his laughing at the girls high schools declaring they were useless while she defended them 
he had spoken slightingly of women s education in general and had said that hannah anna s english protegée had not the slightest need to know anything of physics 
this irritated anna 
she saw in this a contemptuous reference to her occupations 
and she bethought her of a phrase to pay him back for the pain he had given her 
 i don t expect you to understand me my feelings as anyone who loved me might but simple delicacy i did expect  she said 
and he had actually flushed with vexation and had said something unpleasant 
she could not recall her answer but at that point with an unmistakable desire to wound her too he had said  i feel no interest in your infatuation over this girl that s true because i see it s unnatural  
the cruelty with which he shattered the world she had built up for herself so laboriously to enable her to endure her hard life the injustice with which he had accused her of affectation of artificiality aroused her 
 i am very sorry that nothing but what s coarse and material is comprehensible and natural to you  she said and walked out of the room 
when he had come in to her yesterday evening they had not referred to the quarrel but both felt that the quarrel had been smoothed over but was not at an end 
today he had not been at home all day and she felt so lonely and wretched in being on bad terms with him that she wanted to forget it all to forgive him and be reconciled with him she wanted to throw the blame on herself and to justify him 
 i am myself to blame 
i m irritable i m insanely jealous 
i will make it up with him and we ll go away to the country there i shall be more at peace  
 unnatural  
she suddenly recalled the word that had stung her most of all not so much the word itself as the intent to wound her with which it was said 
 i know what he meant he meant  unnatural not loving my own daughter to love another person s child 
what does he know of love for children of my love for seryozha whom i ve sacrificed for him 
but that wish to wound me 
no he loves another woman it must be so  
and perceiving that while trying to regain her peace of mind she had gone round the same circle that she had been round so often before and had come back to her former state of exasperation she was horrified at herself 
 can it be impossible 
can it be beyond me to control myself  
she said to herself and began again from the beginning 
 he s truthful he s honest he loves me 
i love him and in a few days the divorce will come 
what more do i want 
i want peace of mind and trust and i will take the blame on myself 
yes now when he comes in i will tell him i was wrong though i was not wrong and we will go away tomorrow  
and to escape thinking any more and being overcome by irritability she rang and ordered the boxes to be brought up for packing their things for the country 
at ten o clock vronsky came in 
chapter    well was it nice  
she asked coming out to meet him with a penitent and meek expression 
 just as usual  he answered seeing at a glance that she was in one of her good moods 
he was used by now to these transitions and he was particularly glad to see it today as he was in a specially good humor himself 
 what do i see 
come that s good  
he said pointing to the boxes in the passage 
 yes we must go 
i went out for a drive and it was so fine i longed to be in the country 
there s nothing to keep you is there  
 it s the one thing i desire 
i ll be back directly and we ll talk it over i only want to change my coat 
order some tea  
and he went into his room 
there was something mortifying in the way he had said come that s good  as one says to a child when it leaves off being naughty and still more mortifying was the contrast between her penitent and his self confident tone and for one instant she felt the lust of strife rising up in her again but making an effort she conquered it and met vronsky as good humoredly as before 
when he came in she told him partly repeating phrases she had prepared beforehand how she had spent the day and her plans for going away 
 you know it came to me almost like an inspiration  she said 
 why wait here for the divorce 
won t it be just the same in the country 
i can t wait any longer 
i don t want to go on hoping i don t want to hear anything about the divorce 
i have made up my mind it shall not have any more influence on my life 
do you agree  
 oh yes  
he said glancing uneasily at her excited face 
 what did you do 
who was there  
she said after a pause 
vronsky mentioned the names of the guests 
 the dinner was first rate and the boat race and it was all pleasant enough but in moscow they can never do anything without something ridicule 
a lady of a sort appeared on the scene teacher of swimming to the queen of sweden and gave us an exhibition of her skill  
 how 
did she swim  
asked anna frowning 
 in an absurd red  costume de natation  she was old and hideous too 
so when shall we go  
 what an absurd fancy 
why did she swim in some special way then  
said anna not answering 
 there was absolutely nothing in it 
that s just what i say it was awfully stupid 
well then when do you think of going  
anna shook her head as though trying to drive away some unpleasant idea 
 when 
why the sooner the better 
by tomorrow we shan t be ready 
the day after tomorrow  
 yes   oh no wait a minute 
the day after to morrow s sunday i have to be at maman s  said vronsky embarrassed because as soon as he uttered his mother s name he was aware of her intent suspicious eyes 
his embarrassment confirmed her suspicion 
she flushed hotly and drew away from him 
it was now not the queen of sweden s swimming mistress who filled anna s imagination but the young princess sorokina 
she was staying in a village near moscow with countess vronskaya 
 can t you go tomorrow  
she said 
 well no 
the deeds and the money for the business i m going there for i can t get by tomorrow  he answered 
 if so we won t go at all  
 but why so  
 i shall not go later 
monday or never  
 what for  
said vronsky as though in amazement 
 why there s no meaning in it  
 there s no meaning in it to you because you care nothing for me 
you don t care to understand my life 
the one thing that i cared for here was hannah 
you say it s affectation 
why you said yesterday that i don t love my daughter that i love this english girl that it s unnatural 
i should like to know what life there is for me that could be natural  
for an instant she had a clear vision of what she was doing and was horrified at how she had fallen away from her resolution 
but even though she knew it was her own ruin she could not restrain herself could not keep herself from proving to him that he was wrong could not give way to him 
 i never said that i said i did not sympathize with this sudden passion  
 how is it though you boast of your straightforwardness you don t tell the truth  
 i never boast and i never tell lies  he said slowly restraining his rising anger 
 it s a great pity if you can t respect     respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should be 
and if you don t love me any more it would be better and more honest to say so  
 no this is becoming unbearable  
cried vronsky getting up from his chair and stopping short facing her he said speaking deliberately what do you try my patience for  
looking as though he might have said much more but was restraining himself 
 it has limits  
 what do you mean by that  
she cried looking with terror at the undisguised hatred in his whole face and especially in his cruel menacing eyes 
 i mean to say    he was beginning but he checked himself 
 i must ask what it is you want of me  
 what can i want 
all i can want is that you should not desert me as you think of doing  she said understanding all he had not uttered 
 but that i don t want that s secondary 
i want love and there is none 
so then all is over  
she turned towards the door 
 stop 
sto op  
said vronsky with no change in the gloomy lines of his brows though he held her by the hand 
 what is it all about 
i said that we must put off going for three days and on that you told me i was lying that i was not an honorable man  
 yes and i repeat that the man who reproaches me with having sacrificed everything for me  she said recalling the words of a still earlier quarrel that he s worse than a dishonorable man  he s a heartless man  
 oh there are limits to endurance  
he cried and hastily let go her hand 
 he hates me that s clear  she thought and in silence without looking round she walked with faltering steps out of the room 
 he loves another woman that s even clearer  she said to herself as she went into her own room 
 i want love and there is none 
so then all is over  
she repeated the words she had said and it must be ended  
 but how  
she asked herself and she sat down in a low chair before the looking glass 
thoughts of where she would go now whether to the aunt who had brought her up to dolly or simply alone abroad and of what he  was doing now alone in his study whether this was the final quarrel or whether reconciliation were still possible and of what all her old friends at petersburg would say of her now and of how alexey alexandrovitch would look at it and many other ideas of what would happen now after this rupture came into her head but she did not give herself up to them with all her heart 
at the bottom of her heart was some obscure idea that alone interested her but she could not get clear sight of it 
thinking once more of alexey alexandrovitch she recalled the time of her illness after her confinement and the feeling which never left her at that time 
 why didn t i die  
and the words and the feeling of that time came back to her 
and all at once she knew what was in her soul 
yes it was that idea which alone solved all 
 yes to die    
and the shame and disgrace of alexey alexandrovitch and of seryozha and my awful shame it will all be saved by death 
to die 
and he will feel remorse will be sorry will love me he will suffer on my account  
with the trace of a smile of commiseration for herself she sat down in the armchair taking off and putting on the rings on her left hand vividly picturing from different sides his feelings after her death 
approaching footsteps  his steps  distracted her attention 
as though absorbed in the arrangement of her rings she did not even turn to him 
he went up to her and taking her by the hand said softly  anna we ll go the day after tomorrow if you like 
i agree to everything  
she did not speak 
 what is it  
he urged 
 you know  she said and at the same instant unable to restrain herself any longer she burst into sobs 
 cast me off  
she articulated between her sobs 
 i ll go away tomorrow   i ll do more 
what am i 
an immoral woman 
a stone round your neck 
i don t want to make you wretched i don t want to 
i ll set you free 
you don t love me you love someone else  
vronsky besought her to be calm and declared that there was no trace of foundation for her jealousy that he had never ceased and never would cease to love her that he loved her more than ever 
 anna why distress yourself and me so  
he said to her kissing her hands 
there was tenderness now in his face and she fancied she caught the sound of tears in his voice and she felt them wet on her hand 
and instantly anna s despairing jealousy changed to a despairing passion of tenderness 
she put her arms round him and covered with kisses his head his neck his hands 
chapter    feeling that the reconciliation was complete anna set eagerly to work in the morning preparing for their departure 
though it was not settled whether they should go on monday or tuesday as they had each given way to the other anna packed busily feeling absolutely indifferent whether they went a day earlier or later 
she was standing in her room over an open box taking things out of it when he came in to see her earlier than usual dressed to go out 
 i m going off at once to see maman she can send me the money by yegorov 
and i shall be ready to go tomorrow  he said 
though she was in such a good mood the thought of his visit to his mother s gave her a pang 
 no i shan t be ready by then myself  she said and at once reflected so then it was possible to arrange to do as i wished  
 no do as you meant to do 
go into the dining room i m coming directly 
it s only to turn out those things that aren t wanted  she said putting something more on the heap of frippery that lay in annushka s arms 
vronsky was eating his beefsteak when she came into the dining room 
 you wouldn t believe how distasteful these rooms have become to me  she said sitting down beside him to her coffee 
 there s nothing more awful than these  chambres garnies 
there s no individuality in them no soul 
these clocks and curtains and worst of all the wallpapers  they re a nightmare 
i think of vozdvizhenskoe as the promised land 
you re not sending the horses off yet  
 no they will come after us 
where are you going to  
 i wanted to go to wilson s to take some dresses to her 
so it s really to be tomorrow  
she said in a cheerful voice but suddenly her face changed 
vronsky s valet came in to ask him to sign a receipt for a telegram from petersburg 
there was nothing out of the way in vronsky s getting a telegram but he said as though anxious to conceal something from her that the receipt was in his study and he turned hurriedly to her 
 by tomorrow without fail i will finish it all  
 from whom is the telegram  
she asked not hearing him 
 from stiva  he answered reluctantly 
 why didn t you show it to me 
what secret can there be between stiva and me  
vronsky called the valet back and told him to bring the telegram 
 i didn t want to show it to you because stiva has such a passion for telegraphing why telegraph when nothing is settled  
 about the divorce  
 yes but he says he has not been able to come at anything yet 
he has promised a decisive answer in a day or two 
but here it is read it  
with trembling hands anna took the telegram and read what vronsky had told her 
at the end was added little hope but i will do everything possible and impossible  
 i said yesterday that it s absolutely nothing to me when i get or whether i never get a divorce  she said flushing crimson 
 there was not the slightest necessity to hide it from me  
 so he may hide and does hide his correspondence with women from me  she thought 
 yashvin meant to come this morning with voytov  said vronsky i believe he s won from pyevtsov all and more than he can pay about sixty thousand  
 no  she said irritated by his so obviously showing by this change of subject that he was irritated why did you suppose that this news would affect me so that you must even try to hide it 
i said i don t want to consider it and i should have liked you to care as little about it as i do  
 i care about it because i like definiteness  he said 
 definiteness is not in the form but the love  she said more and more irritated not by his words but by the tone of cool composure in which he spoke 
 what do you want it for  
 my god 
love again  he thought frowning 
 oh you know what for for your sake and your children s in the future  
 there won t be children in the future  
 that s a great pity  he said 
 you want it for the children s sake but you don t think of me  
she said quite forgetting or not having heard that he had said  for your sake  and the children s  
the question of the possibility of having children had long been a subject of dispute and irritation to her 
his desire to have children she interpreted as a proof he did not prize her beauty 
 oh i said for your sake 
above all for your sake  he repeated frowning as though in pain because i am certain that the greater part of your irritability comes from the indefiniteness of the position  
 yes now he has laid aside all pretense and all his cold hatred for me is apparent  she thought not hearing his words but watching with terror the cold cruel judge who looked mocking her out of his eyes 
 the cause is not that  she said and indeed i don t see how the cause of my irritability as you call it can be that i am completely in your power 
what indefiniteness is there in the position 
on the contrary     i am very sorry that you don t care to understand  he interrupted obstinately anxious to give utterance to his thought 
 the indefiniteness consists in your imagining that i am free  
 on that score you can set your mind quite at rest  she said and turning away from him she began drinking her coffee 
she lifted her cup with her little finger held apart and put it to her lips 
after drinking a few sips she glanced at him and by his expression she saw clearly that he was repelled by her hand and her gesture and the sound made by her lips 
 i don t care in the least what your mother thinks and what match she wants to make for you  she said putting the cup down with a shaking hand 
 but we are not talking about that  
 yes that s just what we are talking about 
and let me tell you that a heartless woman whether she s old or not old your mother or anyone else is of no consequence to me and i would not consent to know her  
 anna i beg you not to speak disrespectfully of my mother  
 a woman whose heart does not tell her where her son s happiness and honor lie has no heart  
 i repeat my request that you will not speak disrespectfully of my mother whom i respect  he said raising his voice and looking sternly at her 
she did not answer 
looking intently at him at his face his hands she recalled all the details of their reconciliation the previous day and his passionate caresses 
 there just such caresses he has lavished and will lavish and longs to lavish on other women  
she thought 
 you don t love your mother 
that s all talk and talk and talk  
she said looking at him with hatred in her eyes 
 even if so you must     must decide and i have decided  she said and she would have gone away but at that moment yashvin walked into the room 
anna greeted him and remained 
why when there was a tempest in her soul and she felt she was standing at a turning point in her life which might have fearful consequences  why at that minute she had to keep up appearances before an outsider who sooner or later must know it all  she did not know 
but at once quelling the storm within her she sat down and began talking to their guest 
 well how are you getting on 
has your debt been paid you  
she asked yashvin 
 oh pretty fair i fancy i shan t get it all but i shall get a good half 
and when are you off  
said yashvin looking at vronsky and unmistakably guessing at a quarrel 
 the day after tomorrow i think  said vronsky 
 you ve been meaning to go so long though  
 but now it s quite decided  said anna looking vronsky straight in the face with a look which told him not to dream of the possibility of reconciliation 
 don t you feel sorry for that unlucky pyevtsov  
she went on talking to yashvin 
 i ve never asked myself the question anna arkadyevna whether i m sorry for him or not 
you see all my fortune s here   he touched his breast pocket   and just now i m a wealthy man 
but today i m going to the club and i may come out a beggar 
you see whoever sits down to play with me  he wants to leave me without a shirt to my back and so do i him 
and so we fight it out and that s the pleasure of it  
 well but suppose you were married  said anna how would it be for your wife  
yashvin laughed 
 that s why i m not married and never mean to be  
 and helsingfors  
said vronsky entering into the conversation and glancing at anna s smiling face 
meeting his eyes anna s face instantly took a coldly severe expression as though she were saying to him  it s not forgotten 
it s all the same  
 were you really in love  
she said to yashvin 
 oh heavens 
ever so many times 
but you see some men can play but only so that they can always lay down their cards when the hour of a  rendezvous  comes while i can take up love but only so as not to be late for my cards in the evening 
that s how i manage things  
 no i didn t mean that but the real thing  
she would have said  helsingfors  but would not repeat the word used by vronsky 
voytov who was buying the horse came in 
anna got up and went out of the room 
before leaving the house vronsky went into her room 
she would have pretended to be looking for something on the table but ashamed of making a pretense she looked straight in his face with cold eyes 
 what do you want  
she asked in french 
 to get the guarantee for gambetta i ve sold him  he said in a tone which said more clearly than words i ve no time for discussing things and it would lead to nothing  
 i m not to blame in any way  he thought 
 if she will punish herself  tant pis pour elle 
but as he was going he fancied that she said something and his heart suddenly ached with pity for her 
 eh anna  
he queried 
 i said nothing  she answered just as coldly and calmly 
 oh nothing tant pis then  he thought feeling cold again and he turned and went out 
as he was going out he caught a glimpse in the looking glass of her face white with quivering lips 
he even wanted to stop and to say some comforting word to her but his legs carried him out of the room before he could think what to say 
the whole of that day he spent away from home and when he came in late in the evening the maid told him that anna arkadyevna had a headache and begged him not to go in to her 
chapter    never before had a day been passed in quarrel 
today was the first time 
and this was not a quarrel 
it was the open acknowledgment of complete coldness 
was it possible to glance at her as he had glanced when he came into the room for the guarantee   to look at her see her heart was breaking with despair and go out without a word with that face of callous composure 
he was not merely cold to her he hated her because he loved another woman  that was clear 
and remembering all the cruel words he had said anna supplied too the words that he had unmistakably wished to say and could have said to her and she grew more and more exasperated 
 i won t prevent you  he might say 
 you can go where you like 
you were unwilling to be divorced from your husband no doubt so that you might go back to him 
go back to him 
if you want money i ll give it to you 
how many roubles do you want  
all the most cruel words that a brutal man could say he said to her in her imagination and she could not forgive him for them as though he had actually said them 
 but didn t he only yesterday swear he loved me he a truthful and sincere man 
haven t i despaired for nothing many times already  
she said to herself afterwards 
all that day except for the visit to wilson s which occupied two hours anna spent in doubts whether everything were over or whether there were still hope of reconciliation whether she should go away at once or see him once more 
she was expecting him the whole day and in the evening as she went to her own room leaving a message for him that her head ached she said to herself if he comes in spite of what the maid says it means that he loves me still 
if not it means that all is over and then i will decide what i m to do     
in the evening she heard the rumbling of his carriage stop at the entrance his ring his steps and his conversation with the servant he believed what was told him did not care to find out more and went to his own room 
so then everything was over 
and death rose clearly and vividly before her mind as the sole means of bringing back love for her in his heart of punishing him and of gaining the victory in that strife which the evil spirit in possession of her heart was waging with him 
now nothing mattered going or not going to vozdvizhenskoe getting or not getting a divorce from her husband  all that did not matter 
the one thing that mattered was punishing him 
when she poured herself out her usual dose of opium and thought that she had only to drink off the whole bottle to die it seemed to her so simple and easy that she began musing with enjoyment on how he would suffer and repent and love her memory when it would be too late 
she lay in bed with open eyes by the light of a single burned down candle gazing at the carved cornice of the ceiling and at the shadow of the screen that covered part of it while she vividly pictured to herself how he would feel when she would be no more when she would be only a memory to him 
 how could i say such cruel things to her  
he would say 
 how could i go out of the room without saying anything to her 
but now she is no more 
she has gone away from us forever 
she is     suddenly the shadow of the screen wavered pounced on the whole cornice the whole ceiling other shadows from the other side swooped to meet it for an instant the shadows flitted back but then with fresh swiftness they darted forward wavered commingled and all was darkness 
 death  
she thought 
and such horror came upon her that for a long while she could not realize where she was and for a long while her trembling hands could not find the matches and light another candle instead of the one that had burned down and gone out 
 no anything  only to live 
why i love him 
why he loves me 
this has been before and will pass  she said feeling that tears of joy at the return to life were trickling down her cheeks 
and to escape from her panic she went hurriedly to his room 
he was asleep there and sleeping soundly 
she went up to him and holding the light above his face she gazed a long while at him 
now when he was asleep she loved him so that at the sight of him she could not keep back tears of tenderness 
but she knew that if he waked up he would look at her with cold eyes convinced that he was right and that before telling him of her love she would have to prove to him that he had been wrong in his treatment of her 
without waking him she went back and after a second dose of opium she fell towards morning into a heavy incomplete sleep during which she never quite lost consciousness 
in the morning she was waked by a horrible nightmare which had recurred several times in her dreams even before her connection with vronsky 
a little old man with unkempt beard was doing something bent down over some iron muttering meaningless french words and she as she always did in this nightmare it was what made the horror of it  felt that this peasant was taking no notice of her but was doing something horrible with the iron  over her 
and she waked up in a cold sweat 
when she got up the previous day came back to her as though veiled in mist 
 there was a quarrel 
just what has happened several times 
i said i had a headache and he did not come in to see me 
tomorrow we re going away i must see him and get ready for the journey  she said to herself 
and learning that he was in his study she went down to him 
as she passed through the drawing room she heard a carriage stop at the entrance and looking out of the window she saw the carriage from which a young girl in a lilac hat was leaning out giving some direction to the footman ringing the bell 
after a parley in the hall someone came upstairs and vronsky s steps could be heard passing the drawing room 
he went rapidly downstairs 
anna went again to the window 
she saw him come out onto the steps without his hat and go up to the carriage 
the young girl in the lilac hat handed him a parcel 
vronsky smiling said something to her 
the carriage drove away he ran rapidly upstairs again 
the mists that had shrouded everything in her soul parted suddenly 
the feelings of yesterday pierced the sick heart with a fresh pang 
she could not understand now how she could have lowered herself by spending a whole day with him in his house 
she went into his room to announce her determination 
 that was madame sorokina and her daughter 
they came and brought me the money and the deeds from maman 
i couldn t get them yesterday 
how is your head better  
he said quietly not wishing to see and to understand the gloomy and solemn expression of her face 
she looked silently intently at him standing in the middle of the room 
he glanced at her frowned for a moment and went on reading a letter 
she turned and went deliberately out of the room 
he still might have turned her back but she had reached the door he was still silent and the only sound audible was the rustling of the note paper as he turned it 
 oh by the way  he said at the very moment she was in the doorway we re going tomorrow for certain aren t we  
 you but not i  she said turning round to him 
 anna we can t go on like this     you but not i  she repeated 
 this is getting unbearable  
 you   you will be sorry for this  she said and went out 
frightened by the desperate expression with which these words were uttered he jumped up and would have run after her but on second thoughts he sat down and scowled setting his teeth 
this vulgar  as he thought it  threat of something vague exasperated him 
 i ve tried everything  he thought the only thing left is not to pay attention  and he began to get ready to drive into town and again to his mother s to get her signature to the deeds 
she heard the sound of his steps about the study and the dining room 
at the drawing room he stood still 
but he did not turn in to see her he merely gave an order that the horse should be given to voytov if he came while he was away 
then she heard the carriage brought round the door opened and he came out again 
but he went back into the porch again and someone was running upstairs 
it was the valet running up for his gloves that had been forgotten 
she went to the window and saw him take the gloves without looking and touching the coachman on the back he said something to him 
then without looking up at the window he settled himself in his usual attitude in the carriage with his legs crossed and drawing on his gloves he vanished round the corner 
chapter    he has gone 
it is over  
anna said to herself standing at the window and in answer to this statement the impression of the darkness when the candle had flickered out and of her fearful dream mingling into one filled her heart with cold terror 
 no that cannot be  
she cried and crossing the room she rang the bell 
she was so afraid now of being alone that without waiting for the servant to come in she went out to meet him 
 inquire where the count has gone  she said 
the servant answered that the count had gone to the stable 
 his honor left word that if you cared to drive out the carriage would be back immediately  
 very good 
wait a minute 
i ll write a note at once 
send mihail with the note to the stables 
make haste  
she sat down and wrote  i was wrong 
come back home i must explain 
for god s sake come 
i m afraid  
she sealed it up and gave it to the servant 
she was afraid of being left alone now she followed the servant out of the room and went to the nursery 
 why this isn t it this isn t he 
where are his blue eyes his sweet shy smile  
was her first thought when she saw her chubby rosy little girl with her black curly hair instead of seryozha whom in the tangle of her ideas she had expected to see in the nursery 
the little girl sitting at the table was obstinately and violently battering on it with a cork and staring aimlessly at her mother with her pitch black eyes 
answering the english nurse that she was quite well and that she was going to the country tomorrow anna sat down by the little girl and began spinning the cork to show her 
but the child s loud ringing laugh and the motion of her eyebrows recalled vronsky so vividly that she got up hurriedly restraining her sobs and went away 
 can it be all over 
no it cannot be  
she thought 
 he will come back 
but how can he explain that smile that excitement after he had been talking to her 
but even if he doesn t explain i will believe 
if i don t believe there s only one thing left for me and i can t  
she looked at her watch 
twenty minutes had passed 
 by now he has received the note and is coming back 
not long ten minutes more    
but what if he doesn t come 
no that cannot be 
he mustn t see me with tear stained eyes 
i ll go and wash 
yes yes did i do my hair or not  
she asked herself 
and she could not remember 
she felt her head with her hand 
 yes my hair has been done but when i did it i can t in the least remember  
she could not believe the evidence of her hand and went up to the pier glass to see whether she really had done her hair 
she certainly had but she could not think when she had done it 
 who s that  
she thought looking in the looking glass at the swollen face with strangely glittering eyes that looked in a scared way at her 
 why it s i  
she suddenly understood and looking round she seemed all at once to feel his kisses on her and twitched her shoulders shuddering 
then she lifted her hand to her lips and kissed it 
 what is it 
why i m going out of my mind  
and she went into her bedroom where annushka was tidying the room 
 annushka  she said coming to a standstill before her and she stared at the maid not knowing what to say to her 
 you meant to go and see darya alexandrovna  said the girl as though she understood 
 darya alexandrovna 
yes i ll go  
 fifteen minutes there fifteen minutes back 
he s coming he ll be here soon  
she took out her watch and looked at it 
 but how could he go away leaving me in such a state 
how can he live without making it up with me  
she went to the window and began looking into the street 
judging by the time he might be back now 
but her calculations might be wrong and she began once more to recall when he had started and to count the minutes 
at the moment when she had moved away to the big clock to compare it with her watch someone drove up 
glancing out of the window she saw his carriage 
but no one came upstairs and voices could be heard below 
it was the messenger who had come back in the carriage 
she went down to him 
 we didn t catch the count 
the count had driven off on the lower city road  
 what do you say 
what     
she said to the rosy good humored mihail as he handed her back her note 
 why then he has never received it  
she thought 
 go with this note to countess vronskaya s place you know 
and bring an answer back immediately  she said to the messenger 
 and i what am i going to do  
she thought 
 yes i m going to dolly s that s true or else i shall go out of my mind 
yes and i can telegraph too  
and she wrote a telegram 
 i absolutely must talk to you come at once  
after sending off the telegram she went to dress 
when she was dressed and in her hat she glanced again into the eyes of the plump comfortable looking annushka 
there was unmistakable sympathy in those good natured little gray eyes 
 annushka dear what am i to do  
said anna sobbing and sinking helplessly into a chair 
 why fret yourself so anna arkadyevna 
why there s nothing out of the way 
you drive out a little and it ll cheer you up  said the maid 
 yes i m going  said anna rousing herself and getting up 
 and if there s a telegram while i m away send it on to darya alexandrovna s   but no i shall be back myself  
 yes i mustn t think i must do something drive somewhere and most of all get out of this house  she said feeling with terror the strange turmoil going on in her own heart and she made haste to go out and get into the carriage 
 where to  
asked pyotr before getting onto the box 
 to znamenka the oblonskys   
chapter    it was bright and sunny 
a fine rain had been falling all the morning and now it had not long cleared up 
the iron roofs the flags of the roads the flints of the pavements the wheels and leather the brass and the tinplate of the carriages  all glistened brightly in the may sunshine 
it was three o clock and the very liveliest time in the streets 
as she sat in a corner of the comfortable carriage that hardly swayed on its supple springs while the grays trotted swiftly in the midst of the unceasing rattle of wheels and the changing impressions in the pure air anna ran over the events of the last days and she saw her position quite differently from how it had seemed at home 
now the thought of death seemed no longer so terrible and so clear to her and death itself no longer seemed so inevitable 
now she blamed herself for the humiliation to which she had lowered herself 
 i entreat him to forgive me 
i have given in to him 
i have owned myself in fault 
what for 
can t i live without him  
and leaving unanswered the question how she was going to live without him she fell to reading the signs on the shops 
 office and warehouse 
dental surgeon 
yes i ll tell dolly all about it 
she doesn t like vronsky 
i shall be sick and ashamed but i ll tell her 
she loves me and i ll follow her advice 
i won t give in to him i won t let him train me as he pleases 
filippov bun shop 
they say they send their dough to petersburg 
the moscow water is so good for it 
ah the springs at mitishtchen and the pancakes  
and she remembered how long long ago when she was a girl of seventeen she had gone with her aunt to troitsa 
 riding too 
was that really me with red hands 
how much that seemed to me then splendid and out of reach has become worthless while what i had then has gone out of my reach forever 
could i ever have believed then that i could come to such humiliation 
how conceited and self satisfied he will be when he gets my note 
but i will show him     how horrid that paint smells 
why is it they re always painting and building 
modes et robes  she read 
a man bowed to her 
it was annushka s husband 
 our parasites  she remembered how vronsky had said that 
 our 
why our 
what s so awful is that one can t tear up the past by its roots 
one can t tear it out but one can hide one s memory of it 
and i ll hide it  
and then she thought of her past with alexey alexandrovitch of how she had blotted the memory of it out of her life 
 dolly will think i m leaving my second husband and so i certainly must be in the wrong 
as if i cared to be right 
i can t help it  
she said and she wanted to cry 
but at once she fell to wondering what those two girls could be smiling about 
 love most likely 
they don t know how dreary it is how low    
the boulevard and the children 
three boys running playing at horses 
seryozha 
and i m losing everything and not getting him back 
yes i m losing everything if he doesn t return 
perhaps he was late for the train and has come back by now 
longing for humiliation again  
she said to herself 
 no i ll go to dolly and say straight out to her i m unhappy i deserve this i m to blame but still i m unhappy help me 
these horses this carriage  how loathsome i am to myself in this carriage  all his but i won t see them again  
thinking over the words in which she would tell dolly and mentally working her heart up to great bitterness anna went upstairs 
 is there anyone with her  
she asked in the hall 
 katerina alexandrovna levin  answered the footman 
 kitty 
kitty whom vronsky was in love with  
thought anna the girl he thinks of with love 
he s sorry he didn t marry her 
but me he thinks of with hatred and is sorry he had anything to do with me  
the sisters were having a consultation about nursing when anna called 
dolly went down alone to see the visitor who had interrupted their conversation 
 well so you ve not gone away yet 
i meant to have come to you  she said i had a letter from stiva today  
 we had a telegram too  answered anna looking round for kitty 
 he writes that he can t make out quite what alexey alexandrovitch wants but he won t go away without a decisive answer  
 i thought you had someone with you 
can i see the letter  
 yes kitty  said dolly embarrassed 
 she stayed in the nursery 
she has been very ill   so i heard 
may i see the letter  
 i ll get it directly 
but he doesn t refuse on the contrary stiva has hopes  said dolly stopping in the doorway 
 i haven t and indeed i don t wish it  said anna 
 what s this 
does kitty consider it degrading to meet me  
thought anna when she was alone 
 perhaps she s right too 
but it s not for her the girl who was in love with vronsky it s not for her to show me that even if it is true 
i know that in my position i can t be received by any decent woman 
i knew that from the first moment i sacrificed everything to him 
and this is my reward 
oh how i hate him 
and what did i come here for 
i m worse here more miserable  
she heard from the next room the sisters voices in consultation 
 and what am i going to say to dolly now 
amuse kitty by the sight of my wretchedness submit to her patronizing 
no and besides dolly wouldn t understand 
and it would be no good my telling her 
it would only be interesting to see kitty to show her how i despise everyone and everything how nothing matters to me now  
dolly came in with the letter 
anna read it and handed it back in silence 
 i knew all that  she said and it doesn t interest me in the least  
 oh why so 
on the contrary i have hopes  said dolly looking inquisitively at anna 
she had never seen her in such a strangely irritable condition 
 when are you going away  
she asked 
anna half closing her eyes looked straight before her and did not answer 
 why does kitty shrink from me  
she said looking at the door and flushing red 
 oh what nonsense 
she s nursing and things aren t going right with her and i ve been advising her     she s delighted 
she ll be here in a minute  said dolly awkwardly not clever at lying 
 yes here she is  
hearing that anna had called kitty had wanted not to appear but dolly persuaded her 
rallying her forces kitty went in walked up to her blushing and shook hands 
 i am so glad to see you  she said with a trembling voice 
kitty had been thrown into confusion by the inward conflict between her antagonism to this bad woman and her desire to be nice to her 
but as soon as she saw anna s lovely and attractive face all feeling of antagonism disappeared 
 i should not have been surprised if you had not cared to meet me 
i m used to everything 
you have been ill 
yes you are changed  said anna 
kitty felt that anna was looking at her with hostile eyes 
she ascribed this hostility to the awkward position in which anna who had once patronized her must feel with her now and she felt sorry for her 
they talked of kitty s illness of the baby of stiva but it was obvious that nothing interested anna 
 i came to say good bye to you  she said getting up 
 oh when are you going  
but again not answering anna turned to kitty 
 yes i am very glad to have seen you  she said with a smile 
 i have heard so much of you from everyone even from your husband 
he came to see me and i liked him exceedingly  she said unmistakably with malicious intent 
 where is he  
 he has gone back to the country  said kitty blushing 
 remember me to him be sure you do  
 i ll be sure to  
kitty said naïvely looking compassionately into her eyes 
 so good bye dolly  
and kissing dolly and shaking hands with kitty anna went out hurriedly 
 she s just the same and just as charming 
she s very lovely  
said kitty when she was alone with her sister 
 but there s something piteous about her 
awfully piteous  
 yes there s something unusual about her today  said dolly 
 when i went with her into the hall i fancied she was almost crying  
chapter    anna got into the carriage again in an even worse frame of mind than when she set out from home 
to her previous tortures was added now that sense of mortification and of being an outcast which she had felt so distinctly on meeting kitty 
 where to 
home  
asked pyotr 
 yes home  she said not even thinking now where she was going 
 how they looked at me as something dreadful incomprehensible and curious 
what can he be telling the other with such warmth  
she thought staring at two men who walked by 
 can one ever tell anyone what one is feeling 
i meant to tell dolly and it s a good thing i didn t tell her 
how pleased she would have been at my misery 
she would have concealed it but her chief feeling would have been delight at my being punished for the happiness she envied me for 
kitty she would have been even more pleased 
how i can see through her 
she knows i was more than usually sweet to her husband 
and she s jealous and hates me 
and she despises me 
in her eyes i m an immoral woman 
if i were an immoral woman i could have made her husband fall in love with me   if i d cared to 
and indeed i did care to 
there s someone who s pleased with himself  she thought as she saw a fat rubicund gentleman coming towards her 
he took her for an acquaintance and lifted his glossy hat above his bald glossy head and then perceived his mistake 
 he thought he knew me 
well he knows me as well as anyone in the world knows me 
i don t know myself 
i know my appetites as the french say 
they want that dirty ice cream that they do know for certain  she thought looking at two boys stopping an ice cream seller who took a barrel off his head and began wiping his perspiring face with a towel 
 we all want what is sweet and nice 
if not sweetmeats then a dirty ice 
and kitty s the same  if not vronsky then levin 
and she envies me and hates me 
and we all hate each other 
i kitty kitty me 
yes that s the truth 
 tiutkin coiffeur  
je me fais coiffer par tiutkin    
i ll tell him that when he comes  she thought and smiled 
but the same instant she remembered that she had no one now to tell anything amusing to 
 and there s nothing amusing nothing mirthful really 
it s all hateful 
they re singing for vespers and how carefully that merchant crosses himself 
as if he were afraid of missing something 
why these churches and this singing and this humbug 
simply to conceal that we all hate each other like these cab drivers who are abusing each other so angrily 
yashvin says he wants to strip me of my shirt and i him of his  
yes that s the truth  
she was plunged in these thoughts which so engrossed her that she left off thinking of her own position when the carriage drew up at the steps of her house 
it was only when she saw the porter running out to meet her that she remembered she had sent the note and the telegram 
 is there an answer  
she inquired 
 i ll see this minute  answered the porter and glancing into his room he took out and gave her the thin square envelope of a telegram 
 i can t come before ten o clock   vronsky  she read 
 and hasn t the messenger come back  
 no  answered the porter 
 then since it s so i know what i must do  she said and feeling a vague fury and craving for revenge rising up within her she ran upstairs 
 i ll go to him myself 
before going away forever i ll tell him all 
never have i hated anyone as i hate that man  
she thought 
seeing his hat on the rack she shuddered with aversion 
she did not consider that his telegram was an answer to her telegram and that he had not yet received her note 
she pictured him to herself as talking calmly to his mother and princess sorokina and rejoicing at her sufferings 
 yes i must go quickly  she said not knowing yet where she was going 
she longed to get away as quickly as possible from the feelings she had gone through in that awful house 
the servants the walls the things in that house  all aroused repulsion and hatred in her and lay like a weight upon her 
 yes i must go to the railway station and if he s not there then go there and catch him  
anna looked at the railway timetable in the newspapers 
an evening train went at two minutes past eight 
 yes i shall be in time  
she gave orders for the other horses to be put in the carriage and packed in a traveling bag the things needed for a few days 
she knew she would never come back here again 
among the plans that came into her head she vaguely determined that after what would happen at the station or at the countess s house she would go as far as the first town on the nizhni road and stop there 
dinner was on the table she went up but the smell of the bread and cheese was enough to make her feel that all food was disgusting 
she ordered the carriage and went out 
the house threw a shadow now right across the street but it was a bright evening and still warm in the sunshine 
annushka who came down with her things and pyotr who put the things in the carriage and the coachman evidently out of humor were all hateful to her and irritated her by their words and actions 
 i don t want you pyotr  
 but how about the ticket  
 well as you like it doesn t matter  she said crossly 
pyotr jumped on the box and putting his arms akimbo told the coachman to drive to the booking office 
chapter    here it is again 
again i understand it all  
anna said to herself as soon as the carriage had started and swaying lightly rumbled over the tiny cobbles of the paved road and again one impression followed rapidly upon another 
 yes what was the last thing i thought of so clearly  
she tried to recall it  
 tiutkin coiffeur  
  no not that 
yes of what yashvin says the struggle for existence and hatred is the one thing that holds men together 
no it s a useless journey you re making  she said mentally addressing a party in a coach and four evidently going for an excursion into the country 
 and the dog you re taking with you will be no help to you 
you can t get away from yourselves  
turning her eyes in the direction pyotr had turned to look she saw a factory hand almost dead drunk with hanging head being led away by a policeman 
 come he s found a quicker way  she thought 
 count vronsky and i did not find that happiness either though we expected so much from it  
and now for the first time anna turned that glaring light in which she was seeing everything on to her relations with him which she had hitherto avoided thinking about 
 what was it he sought in me 
not love so much as the satisfaction of vanity  
she remembered his words the expression of his face that recalled an abject setter dog in the early days of their connection 
and everything now confirmed this 
 yes there was the triumph of success in him 
of course there was love too but the chief element was the pride of success 
he boasted of me 
now that s over 
there s nothing to be proud of 
not to be proud of but to be ashamed of 
he has taken from me all he could and now i am no use to him 
he is weary of me and is trying not to be dishonorable in his behavior to me 
he let that out yesterday  he wants divorce and marriage so as to burn his ships 
he loves me but how 
the zest is gone as the english say 
that fellow wants everyone to admire him and is very much pleased with himself  she thought looking at a red faced clerk riding on a riding school horse 
 yes there s not the same flavor about me for him now 
if i go away from him at the bottom of his heart he will be glad  
this was not mere supposition she saw it distinctly in the piercing light which revealed to her now the meaning of life and human relations 
 my love keeps growing more passionate and egoistic while his is waning and waning and that s why we re drifting apart  
she went on musing 
 and there s no help for it 
he is everything for me and i want him more and more to give himself up to me entirely 
and he wants more and more to get away from me 
we walked to meet each other up to the time of our love and then we have been irresistibly drifting in different directions 
and there s no altering that 
he tells me i m insanely jealous and i have told myself that i am insanely jealous but it s not true 
i m not jealous but i m unsatisfied 
but    she opened her lips and shifted her place in the carriage in the excitement aroused by the thought that suddenly struck her 
 if i could be anything but a mistress passionately caring for nothing but his caresses but i can t and i don t care to be anything else 
and by that desire i rouse aversion in him and he rouses fury in me and it cannot be different 
don t i know that he wouldn t deceive me that he has no schemes about princess sorokina that he s not in love with kitty that he won t desert me 
i know all that but it makes it no better for me 
if without loving me from  duty  he ll be good and kind to me without what i want that s a thousand times worse than unkindness 
that s  hell 
and that s just how it is 
for a long while now he hasn t loved me 
and where love ends hate begins 
i don t know these streets at all 
hills it seems and still houses and houses     and in the houses always people and people     how many of them no end and all hating each other 
come let me try and think what i want to make me happy 
well 
suppose i am divorced and alexey alexandrovitch lets me have seryozha and i marry vronsky  
thinking of alexey alexandrovitch she at once pictured him with extraordinary vividness as though he were alive before her with his mild lifeless dull eyes the blue veins in his white hands his intonations and the cracking of his fingers and remembering the feeling which had existed between them and which was also called love she shuddered with loathing 
 well i m divorced and become vronsky s wife 
well will kitty cease looking at me as she looked at me today 
no 
and will seryozha leave off asking and wondering about my two husbands 
and is there any new feeling i can awaken between vronsky and me 
is there possible if not happiness some sort of ease from misery 
no no  
she answered now without the slightest hesitation 
 impossible 
we are drawn apart by life and i make his unhappiness and he mine and there s no altering him or me 
every attempt has been made the screw has come unscrewed 
oh a beggar woman with a baby 
she thinks i m sorry for her 
aren t we all flung into the world only to hate each other and so to torture ourselves and each other 
schoolboys coming  laughing seryozha  
she thought 
 i thought too that i loved him and used to be touched by my own tenderness 
but i have lived without him i gave him up for another love and did not regret the exchange till that love was satisfied  
and with loathing she thought of what she meant by that love 
and the clearness with which she saw life now her own and all men s was a pleasure to her 
 it s so with me and pyotr and the coachman fyodor and that merchant and all the people living along the volga where those placards invite one to go and everywhere and always  she thought when she had driven under the low pitched roof of the nizhigorod station and the porters ran to meet her 
 a ticket to obiralovka  
said pyotr 
she had utterly forgotten where and why she was going and only by a great effort she understood the question 
 yes  she said handing him her purse and taking a little red bag in her hand she got out of the carriage 
making her way through the crowd to the first class waiting room she gradually recollected all the details of her position and the plans between which she was hesitating 
and again at the old sore places hope and then despair poisoned the wounds of her tortured fearfully throbbing heart 
as she sat on the star shaped sofa waiting for the train she gazed with aversion at the people coming and going they were all hateful to her  and thought how she would arrive at the station would write him a note and what she would write to him and how he was at this moment complaining to his mother of his position not understanding her sufferings and how she would go into the room and what she would say to him 
then she thought that life might still be happy and how miserably she loved and hated him and how fearfully her heart was beating 
chapter    a bell rang some young men ugly and impudent and at the same time careful of the impression they were making hurried by 
pyotr too crossed the room in his livery and top boots with his dull animal face and came up to her to take her to the train 
some noisy men were quiet as she passed them on the platform and one whispered something about her to another  something vile no doubt 
she stepped up on the high step and sat down in a carriage by herself on a dirty seat that had been white 
her bag lay beside her shaken up and down by the springiness of the seat 
with a foolish smile pyotr raised his hat with its colored band at the window in token of farewell an impudent conductor slammed the door and the latch 
a grotesque looking lady wearing a bustle anna mentally undressed the woman and was appalled at her hideousness  and a little girl laughing affectedly ran down the platform 
 katerina andreevna she s got them all  ma tante 
cried the girl 
 even the child s hideous and affected  thought anna 
to avoid seeing anyone she got up quickly and seated herself at the opposite window of the empty carriage 
a misshapen looking peasant covered with dirt in a cap from which his tangled hair stuck out all round passed by that window stooping down to the carriage wheels 
 there s something familiar about that hideous peasant  thought anna 
and remembering her dream she moved away to the opposite door shaking with terror 
the conductor opened the door and let in a man and his wife 
 do you wish to get out  
anna made no answer 
the conductor and her two fellow passengers did not notice under her veil her panic stricken face 
she went back to her corner and sat down 
the couple seated themselves on the opposite side and intently but surreptitiously scrutinized her clothes 
both husband and wife seemed repulsive to anna 
the husband asked would she allow him to smoke obviously not with a view to smoking but to getting into conversation with her 
receiving her assent he said to his wife in french something about caring less to smoke than to talk 
they made inane and affected remarks to one another entirely for her benefit 
anna saw clearly that they were sick of each other and hated each other 
and no one could have helped hating such miserable monstrosities 
a second bell sounded and was followed by moving of luggage noise shouting and laughter 
it was so clear to anna that there was nothing for anyone to be glad of that this laughter irritated her agonizingly and she would have liked to stop up her ears not to hear it 
at last the third bell rang there was a whistle and a hiss of steam and a clank of chains and the man in her carriage crossed himself 
 it would be interesting to ask him what meaning he attaches to that  thought anna looking angrily at him 
she looked past the lady out of the window at the people who seemed whirling by as they ran beside the train or stood on the platform 
the train jerking at regular intervals at the junctions of the rails rolled by the platform past a stone wall a signal box past other trains the wheels moving more smoothly and evenly resounded with a slight clang on the rails 
the window was lighted up by the bright evening sun and a slight breeze fluttered the curtain 
anna forgot her fellow passengers and to the light swaying of the train she fell to thinking again as she breathed the fresh air 
 yes what did i stop at 
that i couldn t conceive a position in which life would not be a misery that we are all created to be miserable and that we all know it and all invent means of deceiving each other 
and when one sees the truth what is one to do  
 that s what reason is given man for to escape from what worries him  said the lady in french lisping affectedly and obviously pleased with her phrase 
the words seemed an answer to anna s thoughts 
 to escape from what worries him  repeated anna 
and glancing at the red cheeked husband and the thin wife she saw that the sickly wife considered herself misunderstood and the husband deceived her and encouraged her in that idea of herself 
anna seemed to see all their history and all the crannies of their souls as it were turning a light upon them 
but there was nothing interesting in them and she pursued her thought 
 yes i m very much worried and that s what reason was given me for to escape so then one must escape why not put out the light when there s nothing more to look at when it s sickening to look at it all 
but how 
why did the conductor run along the footboard why are they shrieking those young men in that train 
why are they talking why are they laughing 
it s all falsehood all lying all humbug all cruelty     
when the train came into the station anna got out into the crowd of passengers and moving apart from them as if they were lepers she stood on the platform trying to think what she had come here for and what she meant to do 
everything that had seemed to her possible before was now so difficult to consider especially in this noisy crowd of hideous people who would not leave her alone 
one moment porters ran up to her proffering their services then young men clacking their heels on the planks of the platform and talking loudly stared at her people meeting her dodged past on the wrong side 
remembering that she had meant to go on further if there were no answer she stopped a porter and asked if her coachman were not here with a note from count vronsky 
 count vronsky 
they sent up here from the vronskys just this minute to meet princess sorokina and her daughter 
and what is the coachman like  
just as she was talking to the porter the coachman mihail red and cheerful in his smart blue coat and chain evidently proud of having so successfully performed his commission came up to her and gave her a letter 
she broke it open and her heart ached before she had read it 
 i am very sorry your note did not reach me 
i will be home at ten  vronsky had written carelessly     yes that s what i expected  
she said to herself with an evil smile 
 very good you can go home then  she said softly addressing mihail 
she spoke softly because the rapidity of her heart s beating hindered her breathing 
 no i won t let you make me miserable  she thought menacingly addressing not him not herself but the power that made her suffer and she walked along the platform 
two maidservants walking along the platform turned their heads staring at her and making some remarks about her dress 
 real  they said of the lace she was wearing 
the young men would not leave her in peace 
again they passed by peering into her face and with a laugh shouting something in an unnatural voice 
the station master coming up asked her whether she was going by train 
a boy selling kvas never took his eyes off her 
 my god 
where am i to go  
she thought going farther and farther along the platform 
at the end she stopped 
some ladies and children who had come to meet a gentleman in spectacles paused in their loud laughter and talking and stared at her as she reached them 
she quickened her pace and walked away from them to the edge of the platform 
a luggage train was coming in 
the platform began to sway and she fancied she was in the train again 
and all at once she thought of the man crushed by the train the day she had first met vronsky and she knew what she had to do 
with a rapid light step she went down the steps that led from the tank to the rails and stopped quite near the approaching train 
she looked at the lower part of the carriages at the screws and chains and the tall cast iron wheel of the first carriage slowly moving up and trying to measure the middle between the front and back wheels and the very minute when that middle point would be opposite her 
 there  she said to herself looking into the shadow of the carriage at the sand and coal dust which covered the sleepers  there in the very middle and i will punish him and escape from everyone and from myself  
she tried to fling herself below the wheels of the first carriage as it reached her but the red bag which she tried to drop out of her hand delayed her and she was too late she missed the moment 
she had to wait for the next carriage 
a feeling such as she had known when about to take the first plunge in bathing came upon her and she crossed herself 
that familiar gesture brought back into her soul a whole series of girlish and childish memories and suddenly the darkness that had covered everything for her was torn apart and life rose up before her for an instant with all its bright past joys 
but she did not take her eyes from the wheels of the second carriage 
and exactly at the moment when the space between the wheels came opposite her she dropped the red bag and drawing her head back into her shoulders fell on her hands under the carriage and lightly as though she would rise again at once dropped on to her knees 
and at the same instant she was terror stricken at what she was doing 
 where am i 
what am i doing 
what for  
she tried to get up to drop backwards but something huge and merciless struck her on the head and rolled her on her back 
 lord forgive me all  
she said feeling it impossible to struggle 
a peasant muttering something was working at the iron above her 
and the light by which she had read the book filled with troubles falsehoods sorrow and evil flared up more brightly than ever before lighted up for her all that had been in darkness flickered began to grow dim and was quenched forever 
part      chapter    almost two months had passed 
the hot summer was half over but sergey ivanovitch was only just preparing to leave moscow 
sergey ivanovitch s life had not been uneventful during this time 
a year ago he had finished his book the fruit of six years labor sketch of a survey of the principles and forms of government in europe and russia  
several sections of this book and its introduction had appeared in periodical publications and other parts had been read by sergey ivanovitch to persons of his circle so that the leading ideas of the work could not be completely novel to the public 
but still sergey ivanovitch had expected that on its appearance his book would be sure to make a serious impression on society and if it did not cause a revolution in social science it would at any rate make a great stir in the scientific world 
after the most conscientious revision the book had last year been published and had been distributed among the booksellers 
though he asked no one about it reluctantly and with feigned indifference answered his friends inquiries as to how the book was going and did not even inquire of the booksellers how the book was selling sergey ivanovitch was all on the alert with strained attention watching for the first impression his book would make in the world and in literature 
but a week passed a second a third and in society no impression whatever could be detected 
his friends who were specialists and savants occasionally  unmistakably from politeness  alluded to it 
the rest of his acquaintances not interested in a book on a learned subject did not talk of it at all 
and society generally  just now especially absorbed in other things  was absolutely indifferent 
in the press too for a whole month there was not a word about his book 
sergey ivanovitch had calculated to a nicety the time necessary for writing a review but a month passed and a second and still there was silence 
only in the  northern beetle  in a comic article on the singer drabanti who had lost his voice there was a contemptuous allusion to koznishev s book suggesting that the book had been long ago seen through by everyone and was a subject of general ridicule 
at last in the third month a critical article appeared in a serious review 
sergey ivanovitch knew the author of the article 
he had met him once at golubtsov s 
the author of the article was a young man an invalid very bold as a writer but extremely deficient in breeding and shy in personal relations 
in spite of his absolute contempt for the author it was with complete respect that sergey ivanovitch set about reading the article 
the article was awful 
the critic had undoubtedly put an interpretation upon the book which could not possibly be put on it 
but he had selected quotations so adroitly that for people who had not read the book and obviously scarcely anyone had read it it seemed absolutely clear that the whole book was nothing but a medley of high flown phrases not even  as suggested by marks of interrogation  used appropriately and that the author of the book was a person absolutely without knowledge of the subject 
and all this was so wittily done that sergey ivanovitch would not have disowned such wit himself 
but that was just what was so awful 
in spite of the scrupulous conscientiousness with which sergey ivanovitch verified the correctness of the critic s arguments he did not for a minute stop to ponder over the faults and mistakes which were ridiculed but unconsciously he began immediately trying to recall every detail of his meeting and conversation with the author of the article 
 didn t i offend him in some way  
sergey ivanovitch wondered 
and remembering that when they met he had corrected the young man about something he had said that betrayed ignorance sergey ivanovitch found the clue to explain the article 
this article was followed by a deadly silence about the book both in the press and in conversation and sergey ivanovitch saw that his six years task toiled at with such love and labor had gone leaving no trace 
sergey ivanovitch s position was still more difficult from the fact that since he had finished his book he had had no more literary work to do such as had hitherto occupied the greater part of his time 
sergey ivanovitch was clever cultivated healthy and energetic and he did not know what use to make of his energy 
conversations in drawing rooms in meetings assemblies and committees  everywhere where talk was possible  took up part of his time 
but being used for years to town life he did not waste all his energies in talk as his less experienced younger brother did when he was in moscow 
he had a great deal of leisure and intellectual energy still to dispose of 
fortunately for him at this period so difficult for him from the failure of his book the various public questions of the dissenting sects of the american alliance of the samara famine of exhibitions and of spiritualism were definitely replaced in public interest by the slavonic question which had hitherto rather languidly interested society and sergey ivanovitch who had been one of the first to raise this subject threw himself into it heart and soul 
in the circle to which sergey ivanovitch belonged nothing was talked of or written about just now but the servian war 
everything that the idle crowd usually does to kill time was done now for the benefit of the slavonic states 
balls concerts dinners matchboxes ladies dresses beer restaurants  everything testified to sympathy with the slavonic peoples 
from much of what was spoken and written on the subject sergey ivanovitch differed on various points 
he saw that the slavonic question had become one of those fashionable distractions which succeed one another in providing society with an object and an occupation 
he saw too that a great many people were taking up the subject from motives of self interest and self advertisement 
he recognized that the newspapers published a great deal that was superfluous and exaggerated with the sole aim of attracting attention and outbidding one another 
he saw that in this general movement those who thrust themselves most forward and shouted the loudest were men who had failed and were smarting under a sense of injury  generals without armies ministers not in the ministry journalists not on any paper party leaders without followers 
he saw that there was a great deal in it that was frivolous and absurd 
but he saw and recognized an unmistakable growing enthusiasm uniting all classes with which it was impossible not to sympathize 
the massacre of men who were fellow christians and of the same slavonic race excited sympathy for the sufferers and indignation against the oppressors 
and the heroism of the servians and montenegrins struggling for a great cause begot in the whole people a longing to help their brothers not in word but in deed 
but in this there was another aspect that rejoiced sergey ivanovitch 
that was the manifestation of public opinion 
the public had definitely expressed its desire 
the soul of the people had as sergey ivanovitch said found expression 
and the more he worked in this cause the more incontestable it seemed to him that it was a cause destined to assume vast dimensions to create an epoch 
he threw himself heart and soul into the service of this great cause and forgot to think about his book 
his whole time now was engrossed by it so that he could scarcely manage to answer all the letters and appeals addressed to him 
he worked the whole spring and part of the summer and it was only in july that he prepared to go away to his brother s in the country 
he was going both to rest for a fortnight and in the very heart of the people in the farthest wilds of the country to enjoy the sight of that uplifting of the spirit of the people of which like all residents in the capital and big towns he was fully persuaded 
katavasov had long been meaning to carry out his promise to stay with levin and so he was going with him 
chapter    sergey ivanovitch and katavasov had only just reached the station of the kursk line which was particularly busy and full of people that day when looking round for the groom who was following with their things they saw a party of volunteers driving up in four cabs 
ladies met them with bouquets of flowers and followed by the rushing crowd they went into the station 
one of the ladies who had met the volunteers came out of the hall and addressed sergey ivanovitch 
 you too come to see them off  
she asked in french 
 no i m going away myself princess 
to my brother s for a holiday 
do you always see them off  
said sergey ivanovitch with a hardly perceptible smile 
 oh that would be impossible  
answered the princess 
 is it true that eight hundred have been sent from us already 
malvinsky wouldn t believe me  
 more than eight hundred 
if you reckon those who have been sent not directly from moscow over a thousand  answered sergey ivanovitch 
 there 
that s just what i said  
exclaimed the lady 
 and it s true too i suppose that more than a million has been subscribed  
 yes princess  
 what do you say to today s telegram 
beaten the turks again  
 yes so i saw  answered sergey ivanovitch 
they were speaking of the last telegram stating that the turks had been for three days in succession beaten at all points and put to flight and that tomorrow a decisive engagement was expected 
 ah by the way a splendid young fellow has asked leave to go and they ve made some difficulty i don t know why 
i meant to ask you i know him please write a note about his case 
he s being sent by countess lidia ivanovna  
sergey ivanovitch asked for all the details the princess knew about the young man and going into the first class waiting room wrote a note to the person on whom the granting of leave of absence depended and handed it to the princess 
 you know count vronsky the notorious one   is going by this train  
said the princess with a smile full of triumph and meaning when he found her again and gave her the letter 
 i had heard he was going but i did not know when 
by this train  
 i ve seen him 
he s here there s only his mother seeing him off 
it s the best thing anyway that he could do  
 oh yes of course  
while they were talking the crowd streamed by them into the dining room 
they went forward too and heard a gentleman with a glass in his hand delivering a loud discourse to the volunteers 
 in the service of religion humanity and our brothers  the gentleman said his voice growing louder and louder to this great cause mother moscow dedicates you with her blessing 
jivio 
he concluded loudly and tearfully 
everyone shouted  jivio 
and a fresh crowd dashed into the hall almost carrying the princess off her legs 
 ah princess 
that was something like  
said stepan arkadyevitch suddenly appearing in the middle of the crowd and beaming upon them with a delighted smile 
 capitally warmly said wasn t it 
bravo 
and sergey ivanovitch 
why you ought to have said something  just a few words you know to encourage them you do that so well  he added with a soft respectful and discreet smile moving sergey ivanovitch forward a little by the arm 
 no i m just off  
 where to  
 to the country to my brother s  answered sergey ivanovitch 
 then you ll see my wife 
i ve written to her but you ll see her first 
please tell her that they ve seen me and that it s all right  as the english say 
she ll understand 
oh and be so good as to tell her i m appointed secretary of the committee    
but she ll understand 
you know  les petites misères de la vie humaine  he said as it were apologizing to the princess 
 and princess myakaya  not liza but bibish  is sending a thousand guns and twelve nurses 
did i tell you  
 yes i heard so  answered koznishev indifferently 
 it s a pity you re going away  said stepan arkadyevitch 
 tomorrow we re giving a dinner to two who re setting off  dimer bartnyansky from petersburg and our veslovsky grisha 
they re both going 
veslovsky s only lately married 
there s a fine fellow for you 
eh princess  
he turned to the lady 
the princess looked at koznishev without replying 
but the fact that sergey ivanovitch and the princess seemed anxious to get rid of him did not in the least disconcert stepan arkadyevitch 
smiling he stared at the feather in the princess s hat and then about him as though he were going to pick something up 
seeing a lady approaching with a collecting box he beckoned her up and put in a five rouble note 
 i can never see these collecting boxes unmoved while i ve money in my pocket  he said 
 and how about today s telegram 
fine chaps those montenegrins  
 you don t say so  
he cried when the princess told him that vronsky was going by this train 
for an instant stepan arkadyevitch s face looked sad but a minute later when stroking his mustaches and swinging as he walked he went into the hall where vronsky was he had completely forgotten his own despairing sobs over his sister s corpse and he saw in vronsky only a hero and an old friend 
 with all his faults one can t refuse to do him justice  said the princess to sergey ivanovitch as soon as stepan arkadyevitch had left them 
 what a typically russian slav nature 
only i m afraid it won t be pleasant for vronsky to see him 
say what you will i m touched by that man s fate 
do talk to him a little on the way  said the princess 
 yes perhaps if it happens so  
 i never liked him 
but this atones for a great deal 
he s not merely going himself he s taking a squadron at his own expense  
 yes so i heard  
a bell sounded 
everyone crowded to the doors 
 here he is  
said the princess indicating vronsky who with his mother on his arm walked by wearing a long overcoat and wide brimmed black hat 
oblonsky was walking beside him talking eagerly of something 
vronsky was frowning and looking straight before him as though he did not hear what stepan arkadyevitch was saying 
probably on oblonsky s pointing them out he looked round in the direction where the princess and sergey ivanovitch were standing and without speaking lifted his hat 
his face aged and worn by suffering looked stony 
going onto the platform vronsky left his mother and disappeared into a compartment 
on the platform there rang out god save the tsar  then shouts of hurrah  
and  jivio  
one of the volunteers a tall very young man with a hollow chest was particularly conspicuous bowing and waving his felt hat and a nosegay over his head 
then two officers emerged bowing too and a stout man with a big beard wearing a greasy forage cap 
chapter    saying good bye to the princess sergey ivanovitch was joined by katavasov together they got into a carriage full to overflowing and the train started 
at tsaritsino station the train was met by a chorus of young men singing hail to thee  
again the volunteers bowed and poked their heads out but sergey ivanovitch paid no attention to them 
he had had so much to do with the volunteers that the type was familiar to him and did not interest him 
katavasov whose scientific work had prevented his having a chance of observing them hitherto was very much interested in them and questioned sergey ivanovitch 
sergey ivanovitch advised him to go into the second class and talk to them himself 
at the next station katavasov acted on this suggestion 
at the first stop he moved into the second class and made the acquaintance of the volunteers 
they were sitting in a corner of the carriage talking loudly and obviously aware that the attention of the passengers and katavasov as he got in was concentrated upon them 
more loudly than all talked the tall hollow chested young man 
he was unmistakably tipsy and was relating some story that had occurred at his school 
facing him sat a middle aged officer in the austrian military jacket of the guards uniform 
he was listening with a smile to the hollow chested youth and occasionally pulling him up 
the third in an artillery uniform was sitting on a box beside them 
a fourth was asleep 
entering into conversation with the youth katavasov learned that he was a wealthy moscow merchant who had run through a large fortune before he was two and twenty 
katavasov did not like him because he was unmanly and effeminate and sickly 
he was obviously convinced especially now after drinking that he was performing a heroic action and he bragged of it in the most unpleasant way 
the second the retired officer made an unpleasant impression too upon katavasov 
he was it seemed a man who had tried everything 
he had been on a railway had been a land steward and had started factories and he talked quite without necessity of all he had done and used learned expressions quite inappropriately 
the third the artilleryman on the contrary struck katavasov very favorably 
he was a quiet modest fellow unmistakably impressed by the knowledge of the officer and the heroic self sacrifice of the merchant and saying nothing about himself 
when katavasov asked him what had impelled him to go to servia he answered modestly  oh well everyone s going 
the servians want help too 
i m sorry for them  
 yes you artillerymen especially are scarce there  said katavasov 
 oh i wasn t long in the artillery maybe they ll put me into the infantry or the cavalry  
 into the infantry when they need artillery more than anything  
said katavasov fancying from the artilleryman s apparent age that he must have reached a fairly high grade 
 i wasn t long in the artillery i m a cadet retired  he said and he began to explain how he had failed in his examination 
all of this together made a disagreeable impression on katavasov and when the volunteers got out at a station for a drink katavasov would have liked to compare his unfavorable impression in conversation with someone 
there was an old man in the carriage wearing a military overcoat who had been listening all the while to katavasov s conversation with the volunteers 
when they were left alone katavasov addressed him 
 what different positions they come from all those fellows who are going off there  katavasov said vaguely not wishing to express his own opinion and at the same time anxious to find out the old man s views 
the old man was an officer who had served on two campaigns 
he knew what makes a soldier and judging by the appearance and the talk of those persons by the swagger with which they had recourse to the bottle on the journey he considered them poor soldiers 
moreover he lived in a district town and he was longing to tell how one soldier had volunteered from his town a drunkard and a thief whom no one would employ as a laborer 
but knowing by experience that in the present condition of the public temper it was dangerous to express an opinion opposed to the general one and especially to criticize the volunteers unfavorably he too watched katavasov without committing himself 
 well men are wanted there  he said laughing with his eyes 
and they fell to talking of the last war news and each concealed from the other his perplexity as to the engagement expected next day since the turks had been beaten according to the latest news at all points 
and so they parted neither giving expression to his opinion 
katavasov went back to his own carriage and with reluctant hypocrisy reported to sergey ivanovitch his observations of the volunteers from which it would appear that they were capital fellows 
at a big station at a town the volunteers were again greeted with shouts and singing again men and women with collecting boxes appeared and provincial ladies brought bouquets to the volunteers and followed them into the refreshment room but all this was on a much smaller and feebler scale than in moscow 
chapter    while the train was stopping at the provincial town sergey ivanovitch did not go to the refreshment room but walked up and down the platform 
the first time he passed vronsky s compartment he noticed that the curtain was drawn over the window but as he passed it the second time he saw the old countess at the window 
she beckoned to koznishev 
 i m going you see taking him as far as kursk  she said 
 yes so i heard  said sergey ivanovitch standing at her window and peeping in 
 what a noble act on his part  
he added noticing that vronsky was not in the compartment 
 yes after his misfortune what was there for him to do  
 what a terrible thing it was  
said sergey ivanovitch 
 ah what i have been through 
but do get in     ah what i have been through  
she repeated when sergey ivanovitch had got in and sat down beside her 
 you can t conceive it 
for six weeks he did not speak to anyone and would not touch food except when i implored him 
and not for one minute could we leave him alone 
we took away everything he could have used against himself 
we lived on the ground floor but there was no reckoning on anything 
you know of course that he had shot himself once already on her account  she said and the old lady s eyelashes twitched at the recollection 
 yes hers was the fitting end for such a woman 
even the death she chose was low and vulgar  
 it s not for us to judge countess  said sergey ivanovitch but i can understand that it has been very hard for you  
 ah don t speak of it 
i was staying on my estate and he was with me 
a note was brought him 
he wrote an answer and sent it off 
we hadn t an idea that she was close by at the station 
in the evening i had only just gone to my room when my mary told me a lady had thrown herself under the train 
something seemed to strike me at once 
i knew it was she 
the first thing i said was he was not to be told 
but they d told him already 
his coachman was there and saw it all 
when i ran into his room he was beside himself  it was fearful to see him 
he didn t say a word but galloped off there 
i don t know to this day what happened there but he was brought back at death s door 
i shouldn t have known him 
prostration complete  the doctor said 
and that was followed almost by madness 
oh why talk of it  
said the countess with a wave of her hand 
 it was an awful time 
no say what you will she was a bad woman 
why what is the meaning of such desperate passions 
it was all to show herself something out of the way 
well and that she did do 
she brought herself to ruin and two good men  her husband and my unhappy son  
 and what did her husband do  
asked sergey ivanovitch 
 he has taken her daughter 
alexey was ready to agree to anything at first 
now it worries him terribly that he should have given his own child away to another man 
but he can t take back his word 
karenin came to the funeral 
but we tried to prevent his meeting alexey 
for him for her husband it was easier anyway 
she had set him free 
but my poor son was utterly given up to her 
he had thrown up everything his career me and even then she had no mercy on him but of set purpose she made his ruin complete 
no say what you will her very death was the death of a vile woman of no religious feeling 
god forgive me but i can t help hating the memory of her when i look at my son s misery  
 but how is he now  
 it was a blessing from providence for us  this servian war 
i m old and i don t understand the rights and wrongs of it but it s come as a providential blessing to him 
of course for me as his mother it s terrible and what s worse they say  ce n est pas très bien vu a pétersbourg 
but it can t be helped 
it was the one thing that could rouse him 
yashvin  a friend of his  he had lost all he had at cards and he was going to servia 
he came to see him and persuaded him to go 
now it s an interest for him 
do please talk to him a little 
i want to distract his mind 
he s so low spirited 
and as bad luck would have it he has toothache too 
but he ll be delighted to see you 
please do talk to him he s walking up and down on that side  
sergey ivanovitch said he would be very glad to and crossed over to the other side of the station 
chapter    in the slanting evening shadows cast by the baggage piled up on the platform vronsky in his long overcoat and slouch hat with his hands in his pockets strode up and down like a wild beast in a cage turning sharply after twenty paces 
sergey ivanovitch fancied as he approached him that vronsky saw him but was pretending not to see 
this did not affect sergey ivanovitch in the slightest 
he was above all personal considerations with vronsky 
at that moment sergey ivanovitch looked upon vronsky as a man taking an important part in a great cause and koznishev thought it his duty to encourage him and express his approval 
he went up to him 
vronsky stood still looked intently at him recognized him and going a few steps forward to meet him shook hands with him very warmly 
 possibly you didn t wish to see me  said sergey ivanovitch but couldn t i be of use to you  
 there s no one i should less dislike seeing than you  said vronsky 
 excuse me and there s nothing in life for me to like  
 i quite understand and i merely meant to offer you my services  said sergey ivanovitch scanning vronsky s face full of unmistakable suffering 
 wouldn t it be of use to you to have a letter to ristitch  to milan  
 oh no  
vronsky said seeming to understand him with difficulty 
 if you don t mind let s walk on 
it s so stuffy among the carriages 
a letter 
no thank you to meet death one needs no letters of introduction 
nor for the turks    he said with a smile that was merely of the lips 
his eyes still kept their look of angry suffering 
 yes but you might find it easier to get into relations which are after all essential with anyone prepared to see you 
but that s as you like 
i was very glad to hear of your intention 
there have been so many attacks made on the volunteers and a man like you raises them in public estimation  
 my use as a man  said vronsky is that life s worth nothing to me 
and that i ve enough bodily energy to cut my way into their ranks and to trample on them or fall  i know that 
i m glad there s something to give my life for for it s not simply useless but loathsome to me 
anyone s welcome to it  
and his jaw twitched impatiently from the incessant gnawing toothache that prevented him from even speaking with a natural expression 
 you will become another man i predict  said sergey ivanovitch feeling touched 
 to deliver one s brother men from bondage is an aim worth death and life 
god grant you success outwardly  and inwardly peace  he added and he held out his hand 
vronsky warmly pressed his outstretched hand 
 yes as a weapon i may be of some use 
but as a man i m a wreck  he jerked out 
he could hardly speak for the throbbing ache in his strong teeth that were like rows of ivory in his mouth 
he was silent and his eyes rested on the wheels of the tender slowly and smoothly rolling along the rails 
and all at once a different pain not an ache but an inner trouble that set his whole being in anguish made him for an instant forget his toothache 
as he glanced at the tender and the rails under the influence of the conversation with a friend he had not met since his misfortune he suddenly recalled her  that is what was left of her when he had run like one distraught into the cloak room of the railway station  on the table shamelessly sprawling out among strangers the bloodstained body so lately full of life the head unhurt dropping back with its weight of hair and the curling tresses about the temples and the exquisite face with red half opened mouth the strange fixed expression piteous on the lips and awful in the still open eyes that seemed to utter that fearful phrase  that he would be sorry for it  that she had said when they were quarreling 
and he tried to think of her as she was when he met her the first time at a railway station too mysterious exquisite loving seeking and giving happiness and not cruelly revengeful as he remembered her on that last moment 
he tried to recall his best moments with her but those moments were poisoned forever 
he could only think of her as triumphant successful in her menace of a wholly useless remorse never to be effaced 
he lost all consciousness of toothache and his face worked with sobs 
passing twice up and down beside the baggage in silence and regaining his self possession he addressed sergey ivanovitch calmly  you have had no telegrams since yesterday s 
yes driven back for a third time but a decisive engagement expected for tomorrow  
and after talking a little more of king milan s proclamation and the immense effect it might have they parted going to their carriages on hearing the second bell 
chapter    sergey ivanovitch had not telegraphed to his brother to send to meet him as he did not know when he should be able to leave moscow 
levin was not at home when katavasov and sergey ivanovitch in a fly hired at the station drove up to the steps of the pokrovskoe house as black as moors from the dust of the road 
kitty sitting on the balcony with her father and sister recognized her brother in law and ran down to meet him 
 what a shame not to have let us know  she said giving her hand to sergey ivanovitch and putting her forehead up for him to kiss 
 we drove here capitally and have not put you out  answered sergey ivanovitch 
 i m so dirty 
i m afraid to touch you 
i ve been so busy i didn t know when i should be able to tear myself away 
and so you re still as ever enjoying your peaceful quiet happiness  he said smiling out of the reach of the current in your peaceful backwater 
here s our friend fyodor vassilievitch who has succeeded in getting here at last  
 but i m not a negro i shall look like a human being when i wash  said katavasov in his jesting fashion and he shook hands and smiled his teeth flashing white in his black face 
 kostya will be delighted 
he has gone to his settlement 
it s time he should be home  
 busy as ever with his farming 
it really is a peaceful backwater  said katavasov while we in town think of nothing but the servian war 
well how does our friend look at it 
he s sure not to think like other people  
 oh i don t know like everybody else  kitty answered a little embarrassed looking round at sergey ivanovitch 
 i ll send to fetch him 
papa s staying with us 
he s only just come home from abroad  
and making arrangements to send for levin and for the guests to wash one in his room and the other in what had been dolly s and giving orders for their luncheon kitty ran out onto the balcony enjoying the freedom and rapidity of movement of which she had been deprived during the months of her pregnancy 
 it s sergey ivanovitch and katavasov a professor  she said 
 oh that s a bore in this heat  said the prince 
 no papa he s very nice and kostya s very fond of him  kitty said with a deprecating smile noticing the irony on her father s face 
 oh i didn t say anything  
 you go to them darling  said kitty to her sister and entertain them 
they saw stiva at the station he was quite well 
and i must run to mitya 
as ill luck would have it i haven t fed him since tea 
he s awake now and sure to be screaming  
and feeling a rush of milk she hurried to the nursery 
this was not a mere guess her connection with the child was still so close that she could gauge by the flow of her milk his need of food and knew for certain he was hungry 
she knew he was crying before she reached the nursery 
and he was indeed crying 
she heard him and hastened 
but the faster she went the louder he screamed 
it was a fine healthy scream hungry and impatient 
 has he been screaming long nurse very long  
said kitty hurriedly seating herself on a chair and preparing to give the baby the breast 
 but give me him quickly 
oh nurse how tiresome you are 
there tie the cap afterwards do  
the baby s greedy scream was passing into sobs 
 but you can t manage so ma am  said agafea mihalovna who was almost always to be found in the nursery 
 he must be put straight 
a oo 
a oo  
she chanted over him paying no attention to the mother 
the nurse brought the baby to his mother 
agafea mihalovna followed him with a face dissolving with tenderness 
 he knows me he knows me 
in god s faith katerina alexandrovna ma am he knew me  
agafea mihalovna cried above the baby s screams 
but kitty did not hear her words 
her impatience kept growing like the baby s 
their impatience hindered things for a while 
the baby could not get hold of the breast right and was furious 
at last after despairing breathless screaming and vain sucking things went right and mother and child felt simultaneously soothed and both subsided into calm 
 but poor darling he s all in perspiration  
said kitty in a whisper touching the baby 
 what makes you think he knows you  
she added with a sidelong glance at the baby s eyes that peered roguishly as she fancied from under his cap at his rhythmically puffing cheeks and the little red palmed hand he was waving 
 impossible 
if he knew anyone he would have known me  said kitty in response to agafea mihalovna s statement and she smiled 
she smiled because though she said he could not know her in her heart she was sure that he knew not merely agafea mihalovna but that he knew and understood everything and knew and understood a great deal too that no one else knew and that she his mother had learned and come to understand only through him 
to agafea mihalovna to the nurse to his grandfather to his father even mitya was a living being requiring only material care but for his mother he had long been a mortal being with whom there had been a whole series of spiritual relations already 
 when he wakes up please god you shall see for yourself 
then when i do like this he simply beams on me the darling 
simply beams like a sunny day  
said agafea mihalovna 
 well well then we shall see  whispered kitty 
 but now go away he s going to sleep  
chapter    agafea mihalovna went out on tiptoe the nurse let down the blind chased a fly out from under the muslin canopy of the crib and a bumblebee struggling on the window frame and sat down waving a faded branch of birch over the mother and the baby 
 how hot it is 
if god would send a drop of rain  she said 
 yes yes sh  sh  sh   was all kitty answered rocking a little and tenderly squeezing the plump little arm with rolls of fat at the wrist which mitya still waved feebly as he opened and shut his eyes 
that hand worried kitty she longed to kiss the little hand but was afraid to for fear of waking the baby 
at last the little hand ceased waving and the eyes closed 
only from time to time as he went on sucking the baby raised his long curly eyelashes and peeped at his mother with wet eyes that looked black in the twilight 
the nurse had left off fanning and was dozing 
from above came the peals of the old prince s voice and the chuckle of katavasov 
 they have got into talk without me  thought kitty but still it s vexing that kostya s out 
he s sure to have gone to the bee house again 
though it s a pity he s there so often still i m glad 
it distracts his mind 
he s become altogether happier and better now than in the spring 
he used to be so gloomy and worried that i felt frightened for him 
and how absurd he is  
she whispered smiling 
she knew what worried her husband 
it was his unbelief 
although if she had been asked whether she supposed that in the future life if he did not believe he would be damned she would have had to admit that he would be damned his unbelief did not cause her unhappiness 
and she confessing that for an unbeliever there can be no salvation and loving her husband s soul more than anything in the world thought with a smile of his unbelief and told herself that he was absurd 
 what does he keep reading philosophy of some sort for all this year  
she wondered 
 if it s all written in those books he can understand them 
if it s all wrong why does he read them 
he says himself that he would like to believe 
then why is it he doesn t believe 
surely from his thinking so much 
and he thinks so much from being solitary 
he s always alone alone 
he can t talk about it all to us 
i fancy he ll be glad of these visitors especially katavasov 
he likes discussions with them  she thought and passed instantly to the consideration of where it would be more convenient to put katavasov to sleep alone or to share sergey ivanovitch s room 
and then an idea suddenly struck her which made her shudder and even disturb mitya who glanced severely at her 
 i do believe the laundress hasn t sent the washing yet and all the best sheets are in use 
if i don t see to it agafea mihalovna will give sergey ivanovitch the wrong sheets  and at the very idea of this the blood rushed to kitty s face 
 yes i will arrange it  she decided and going back to her former thoughts she remembered that some spiritual question of importance had been interrupted and she began to recall what 
 yes kostya an unbeliever  she thought again with a smile 
 well an unbeliever then 
better let him always be one than like madame stahl or what i tried to be in those days abroad 
no he won t ever sham anything  
and a recent instance of his goodness rose vividly to her mind 
a fortnight ago a penitent letter had come from stepan arkadyevitch to dolly 
he besought her to save his honor to sell her estate to pay his debts 
dolly was in despair she detested her husband despised him pitied him resolved on a separation resolved to refuse but ended by agreeing to sell part of her property 
after that with an irrepressible smile of tenderness kitty recalled her husband s shamefaced embarrassment his repeated awkward efforts to approach the subject and how at last having thought of the one means of helping dolly without wounding her pride he had suggested to kitty  what had not occurred to her before  that she should give up her share of the property 
 he an unbeliever indeed 
with his heart his dread of offending anyone even a child 
everything for others nothing for himself 
sergey ivanovitch simply considers it as kostya s duty to be his steward 
and it s the same with his sister 
now dolly and her children are under his guardianship all these peasants who come to him every day as though he were bound to be at their service  
 yes only be like your father only like him  she said handing mitya over to the nurse and putting her lips to his cheek 
chapter    ever since by his beloved brother s deathbed levin had first glanced into the questions of life and death in the light of these new convictions as he called them which had during the period from his twentieth to his thirty fourth year imperceptibly replaced his childish and youthful beliefs  he had been stricken with horror not so much of death as of life without any knowledge of whence and why and how and what it was 
the physical organization its decay the indestructibility of matter the law of the conservation of energy evolution were the words which usurped the place of his old belief 
these words and the ideas associated with them were very well for intellectual purposes 
but for life they yielded nothing and levin felt suddenly like a man who has changed his warm fur cloak for a muslin garment and going for the first time into the frost is immediately convinced not by reason but by his whole nature that he is as good as naked and that he must infallibly perish miserably 
from that moment though he did not distinctly face it and still went on living as before levin had never lost this sense of terror at his lack of knowledge 
he vaguely felt too that what he called his new convictions were not merely lack of knowledge but that they were part of a whole order of ideas in which no knowledge of what he needed was possible 
at first marriage with the new joys and duties bound up with it had completely crowded out these thoughts 
but of late while he was staying in moscow after his wife s confinement with nothing to do the question that clamored for solution had more and more often more and more insistently haunted levin s mind 
the question was summed up for him thus if i do not accept the answers christianity gives to the problems of my life what answers do i accept  
and in the whole arsenal of his convictions so far from finding any satisfactory answers he was utterly unable to find anything at all like an answer 
he was in the position of a man seeking food in toy shops and tool shops 
instinctively unconsciously with every book with every conversation with every man he met he was on the lookout for light on these questions and their solution 
what puzzled and distracted him above everything was that the majority of men of his age and circle had like him exchanged their old beliefs for the same new convictions and yet saw nothing to lament in this and were perfectly satisfied and serene 
so that apart from the principal question levin was tortured by other questions too 
were these people sincere 
he asked himself or were they playing a part 
or was it that they understood the answers science gave to these problems in some different clearer sense than he did 
and he assiduously studied both these men s opinions and the books which treated of these scientific explanations 
one fact he had found out since these questions had engrossed his mind was that he had been quite wrong in supposing from the recollections of the circle of his young days at college that religion had outlived its day and that it was now practically non existent 
all the people nearest to him who were good in their lives were believers 
the old prince and lvov whom he liked so much and sergey ivanovitch and all the women believed and his wife believed as simply as he had believed in his earliest childhood and ninety nine hundredths of the russian people all the working people for whose life he felt the deepest respect believed 
another fact of which he became convinced after reading many scientific books was that the men who shared his views had no other construction to put on them and that they gave no explanation of the questions which he felt he could not live without answering but simply ignored their existence and attempted to explain other questions of no possible interest to him such as the evolution of organisms the materialistic theory of consciousness and so forth 
moreover during his wife s confinement something had happened that seemed extraordinary to him 
he an unbeliever had fallen into praying and at the moment he prayed he believed 
but that moment had passed and he could not make his state of mind at that moment fit into the rest of his life 
he could not admit that at that moment he knew the truth and that now he was wrong for as soon as he began thinking calmly about it it all fell to pieces 
he could not admit that he was mistaken then for his spiritual condition then was precious to him and to admit that it was a proof of weakness would have been to desecrate those moments 
he was miserably divided against himself and strained all his spiritual forces to the utmost to escape from this condition 
chapter    these doubts fretted and harassed him growing weaker or stronger from time to time but never leaving him 
he read and thought and the more he read and the more he thought the further he felt from the aim he was pursuing 
of late in moscow and in the country since he had become convinced that he would find no solution in the materialists he had read and re read thoroughly plato spinoza kant schelling hegel and schopenhauer the philosophers who gave a non materialistic explanation of life 
their ideas seemed to him fruitful when he was reading or was himself seeking arguments to refute other theories especially those of the materialists but as soon as he began to read or sought for himself a solution of problems the same thing always happened 
as long as he followed the fixed definition of obscure words such as  spirit will freedom essence  purposely letting himself go into the snare of words the philosophers set for him he seemed to comprehend something 
but he had only to forget the artificial train of reasoning and to turn from life itself to what had satisfied him while thinking in accordance with the fixed definitions and all this artificial edifice fell to pieces at once like a house of cards and it became clear that the edifice had been built up out of those transposed words apart from anything in life more important than reason 
at one time reading schopenhauer he put in place of his will the word  love  and for a couple of days this new philosophy charmed him till he removed a little away from it 
but then when he turned from life itself to glance at it again it fell away too and proved to be the same muslin garment with no warmth in it 
his brother sergey ivanovitch advised him to read the theological works of homiakov 
levin read the second volume of homiakov s works and in spite of the elegant epigrammatic argumentative style which at first repelled him he was impressed by the doctrine of the church he found in them 
he was struck at first by the idea that the apprehension of divine truths had not been vouchsafed to man but to a corporation of men bound together by love  to the church 
what delighted him was the thought how much easier it was to believe in a still existing living church embracing all the beliefs of men and having god at its head and therefore holy and infallible and from it to accept the faith in god in the creation the fall the redemption than to begin with god a mysterious far away god the creation etc 
but afterwards on reading a catholic writer s history of the church and then a greek orthodox writer s history of the church and seeing that the two churches in their very conception infallible each deny the authority of the other homiakov s doctrine of the church lost all its charm for him and this edifice crumbled into dust like the philosophers edifices 
all that spring he was not himself and went through fearful moments of horror 
 without knowing what i am and why i am here life s impossible and that i can t know and so i can t live  levin said to himself 
 in infinite time in infinite matter in infinite space is formed a bubble organism and that bubble lasts a while and bursts and that bubble is me  
it was an agonizing error but it was the sole logical result of ages of human thought in that direction 
this was the ultimate belief on which all the systems elaborated by human thought in almost all their ramifications rested 
it was the prevalent conviction and of all other explanations levin had unconsciously not knowing when or how chosen it as anyway the clearest and made it his own 
but it was not merely a falsehood it was the cruel jeer of some wicked power some evil hateful power to whom one could not submit 
he must escape from this power 
and the means of escape every man had in his own hands 
he had but to cut short this dependence on evil 
and there was one means  death 
and levin a happy father and husband in perfect health was several times so near suicide that he hid the cord that he might not be tempted to hang himself and was afraid to go out with his gun for fear of shooting himself 
but levin did not shoot himself and did not hang himself he went on living 
chapter    when levin thought what he was and what he was living for he could find no answer to the questions and was reduced to despair but he left off questioning himself about it 
it seemed as though he knew both what he was and for what he was living for he acted and lived resolutely and without hesitation 
indeed in these latter days he was far more decided and unhesitating in life than he had ever been 
when he went back to the country at the beginning of june he went back also to his usual pursuits 
the management of the estate his relations with the peasants and the neighbors the care of his household the management of his sister s and brother s property of which he had the direction his relations with his wife and kindred the care of his child and the new bee keeping hobby he had taken up that spring filled all his time 
these things occupied him now not because he justified them to himself by any sort of general principles as he had done in former days on the contrary disappointed by the failure of his former efforts for the general welfare and too much occupied with his own thought and the mass of business with which he was burdened from all sides he had completely given up thinking of the general good and he busied himself with all this work simply because it seemed to him that he must do what he was doing  that he could not do otherwise 
in former days  almost from childhood and increasingly up to full manhood  when he had tried to do anything that would be good for all for humanity for russia for the whole village he had noticed that the idea of it had been pleasant but the work itself had always been incoherent that then he had never had a full conviction of its absolute necessity and that the work that had begun by seeming so great had grown less and less till it vanished into nothing 
but now since his marriage when he had begun to confine himself more and more to living for himself though he experienced no delight at all at the thought of the work he was doing he felt a complete conviction of its necessity saw that it succeeded far better than in old days and that it kept on growing more and more 
now involuntarily it seemed he cut more and more deeply into the soil like a plough so that he could not be drawn out without turning aside the furrow 
to live the same family life as his father and forefathers  that is in the same condition of culture  and to bring up his children in the same was incontestably necessary 
it was as necessary as dining when one was hungry 
and to do this just as it was necessary to cook dinner it was necessary to keep the mechanism of agriculture at pokrovskoe going so as to yield an income 
just as incontestably as it was necessary to repay a debt was it necessary to keep the property in such a condition that his son when he received it as a heritage would say thank you to his father as levin had said thank you to his grandfather for all he built and planted 
and to do this it was necessary to look after the land himself not to let it and to breed cattle manure the fields and plant timber 
it was impossible not to look after the affairs of sergey ivanovitch of his sister of the peasants who came to him for advice and were accustomed to do so  as impossible as to fling down a child one is carrying in one s arms 
it was necessary to look after the comfort of his sister in law and her children and of his wife and baby and it was impossible not to spend with them at least a short time each day 
and all this together with shooting and his new bee keeping filled up the whole of levin s life which had no meaning at all for him when he began to think 
but besides knowing thoroughly what he had to do levin knew in just the same way  how  he had to do it all and what was more important than the rest 
he knew he must hire laborers as cheaply as possible but to hire men under bond paying them in advance at less than the current rate of wages was what he must not do even though it was very profitable 
selling straw to the peasants in times of scarcity of provender was what he might do even though he felt sorry for them but the tavern and the pothouse must be put down though they were a source of income 
felling timber must be punished as severely as possible but he could not exact forfeits for cattle being driven onto his fields and though it annoyed the keeper and made the peasants not afraid to graze their cattle on his land he could not keep their cattle as a punishment 
to pyotr who was paying a money lender  per cent 
a month he must lend a sum of money to set him free 
but he could not let off peasants who did not pay their rent nor let them fall into arrears 
it was impossible to overlook the bailiff s not having mown the meadows and letting the hay spoil and it was equally impossible to mow those acres where a young copse had been planted 
it was impossible to excuse a laborer who had gone home in the busy season because his father was dying however sorry he might feel for him and he must subtract from his pay those costly months of idleness 
but it was impossible not to allow monthly rations to the old servants who were of no use for anything 
levin knew that when he got home he must first of all go to his wife who was unwell and that the peasants who had been waiting for three hours to see him could wait a little longer 
he knew too that regardless of all the pleasure he felt in taking a swarm he must forego that pleasure and leave the old man to see to the bees alone while he talked to the peasants who had come after him to the bee house 
whether he were acting rightly or wrongly he did not know and far from trying to prove that he was nowadays he avoided all thought or talk about it 
reasoning had brought him to doubt and prevented him from seeing what he ought to do and what he ought not 
when he did not think but simply lived he was continually aware of the presence of an infallible judge in his soul determining which of two possible courses of action was the better and which was the worse and as soon as he did not act rightly he was at once aware of it 
so he lived not knowing and not seeing any chance of knowing what he was and what he was living for and harassed at this lack of knowledge to such a point that he was afraid of suicide and yet firmly laying down his own individual definite path in life 
chapter    the day on which sergey ivanovitch came to pokrovskoe was one of levin s most painful days 
it was the very busiest working time when all the peasantry show an extraordinary intensity of self sacrifice in labor such as is never shown in any other conditions of life and would be highly esteemed if the men who showed these qualities themselves thought highly of them and if it were not repeated every year and if the results of this intense labor were not so simple 
to reap and bind the rye and oats and to carry it to mow the meadows turn over the fallows thrash the seed and sow the winter corn  all this seems so simple and ordinary but to succeed in getting through it all everyone in the village from the old man to the young child must toil incessantly for three or four weeks three times as hard as usual living on rye beer onions and black bread thrashing and carrying the sheaves at night and not giving more than two or three hours in the twenty four to sleep 
and every year this is done all over russia 
having lived the greater part of his life in the country and in the closest relations with the peasants levin always felt in this busy time that he was infected by this general quickening of energy in the people 
in the early morning he rode over to the first sowing of the rye and to the oats which were being carried to the stacks and returning home at the time his wife and sister in law were getting up he drank coffee with them and walked to the farm where a new thrashing machine was to be set working to get ready the seed corn 
he was standing in the cool granary still fragrant with the leaves of the hazel branches interlaced on the freshly peeled aspen beams of the new thatch roof 
he gazed through the open door in which the dry bitter dust of the thrashing whirled and played at the grass of the thrashing floor in the sunlight and the fresh straw that had been brought in from the barn then at the speckly headed white breasted swallows that flew chirping in under the roof and fluttering their wings settled in the crevices of the doorway then at the peasants bustling in the dark dusty barn and he thought strange thoughts 
 why is it all being done  
he thought 
 why am i standing here making them work 
what are they all so busy for trying to show their zeal before me 
what is that old matrona my old friend toiling for 
 i doctored her when the beam fell on her in the fire  he thought looking at a thin old woman who was raking up the grain moving painfully with her bare sun blackened feet over the uneven rough floor 
 then she recovered but today or tomorrow or in ten years she won t they ll bury her and nothing will be left either of her or of that smart girl in the red jacket who with that skillful soft action shakes the ears out of their husks 
they ll bury her and this piebald horse and very soon too  he thought gazing at the heavily moving panting horse that kept walking up the wheel that turned under him 
 and they will bury her and fyodor the thrasher with his curly beard full of chaff and his shirt torn on his white shoulders  they will bury him 
he s untying the sheaves and giving orders and shouting to the women and quickly setting straight the strap on the moving wheel 
and what s more it s not them alone  me they ll bury too and nothing will be left 
what for  
he thought this and at the same time looked at his watch to reckon how much they thrashed in an hour 
he wanted to know this so as to judge by it the task to set for the day 
 it ll soon be one and they re only beginning the third sheaf  thought levin 
he went up to the man that was feeding the machine and shouting over the roar of the machine he told him to put it in more slowly 
 you put in too much at a time fyodor 
do you see  it gets choked that s why it isn t getting on 
do it evenly  
fyodor black with the dust that clung to his moist face shouted something in response but still went on doing it as levin did not want him to 
levin going up to the machine moved fyodor aside and began feeding the corn in himself 
working on till the peasants dinner hour which was not long in coming he went out of the barn with fyodor and fell into talk with him stopping beside a neat yellow sheaf of rye laid on the thrashing floor for seed 
fyodor came from a village at some distance from the one in which levin had once allotted land to his cooperative association 
now it had been let to a former house porter 
levin talked to fyodor about this land and asked whether platon a well to do peasant of good character belonging to the same village would not take the land for the coming year 
 it s a high rent it wouldn t pay platon konstantin dmitrievitch  answered the peasant picking the ears off his sweat drenched shirt 
 but how does kirillov make it pay  
 mituh  
 so the peasant called the house porter in a tone of contempt  you may be sure he ll make it pay konstantin dmitrievitch 
he ll get his share however he has to squeeze to get it 
he s no mercy on a christian 
but uncle fokanitch so he called the old peasant platon  do you suppose he d flay the skin off a man 
where there s debt he ll let anyone off 
and he ll not wring the last penny out 
he s a man too  
 but why will he let anyone off  
 oh well of course folks are different 
one man lives for his own wants and nothing else like mituh he only thinks of filling his belly but fokanitch is a righteous man 
he lives for his soul 
he does not forget god  
 how thinks of god 
how does he live for his soul  
levin almost shouted 
 why to be sure in truth in god s way 
folks are different 
take you now you wouldn t wrong a man      yes yes good bye  
said levin breathless with excitement and turning round he took his stick and walked quickly away towards home 
at the peasant s words that fokanitch lived for his soul in truth in god s way undefined but significant ideas seemed to burst out as though they had been locked up and all striving towards one goal they thronged whirling through his head blinding him with their light 
chapter    levin strode along the highroad absorbed not so much in his thoughts he could not yet disentangle them as in his spiritual condition unlike anything he had experienced before 
the words uttered by the peasant had acted on his soul like an electric shock suddenly transforming and combining into a single whole the whole swarm of disjointed impotent separate thoughts that incessantly occupied his mind 
these thoughts had unconsciously been in his mind even when he was talking about the land 
he was aware of something new in his soul and joyfully tested this new thing not yet knowing what it was 
 not living for his own wants but for god 
for what god 
and could one say anything more senseless than what he said 
he said that one must not live for one s own wants that is that one must not live for what we understand what we are attracted by what we desire but must live for something incomprehensible for god whom no one can understand nor even define 
what of it 
didn t i understand those senseless words of fyodor s 
and understanding them did i doubt of their truth 
did i think them stupid obscure inexact 
no i understood him and exactly as he understands the words 
i understood them more fully and clearly than i understand anything in life and never in my life have i doubted nor can i doubt about it 
and not only i but everyone the whole world understands nothing fully but this and about this only they have no doubt and are always agreed 
 and i looked out for miracles complained that i did not see a miracle which would convince me 
a material miracle would have persuaded me 
and here is a miracle the sole miracle possible continually existing surrounding me on all sides and i never noticed it 
 fyodor says that kirillov lives for his belly 
that s comprehensible and rational 
all of us as rational beings can t do anything else but live for our belly 
and all of a sudden the same fyodor says that one mustn t live for one s belly but must live for truth for god and at a hint i understand him 
and i and millions of men men who lived ages ago and men living now  peasants the poor in spirit and the learned who have thought and written about it in their obscure words saying the same thing  we are all agreed about this one thing what we must live for and what is good 
i and all men have only one firm incontestable clear knowledge and that knowledge cannot be explained by the reason  it is outside it and has no causes and can have no effects 
 if goodness has causes it is not goodness if it has effects a reward it is not goodness either 
so goodness is outside the chain of cause and effect 
 and yet i know it and we all know it 
 what could be a greater miracle than that 
 can i have found the solution of it all 
can my sufferings be over  
thought levin striding along the dusty road not noticing the heat nor his weariness and experiencing a sense of relief from prolonged suffering 
this feeling was so delicious that it seemed to him incredible 
he was breathless with emotion and incapable of going farther he turned off the road into the forest and lay down in the shade of an aspen on the uncut grass 
he took his hat off his hot head and lay propped on his elbow in the lush feathery woodland grass 
 yes i must make it clear to myself and understand  he thought looking intently at the untrampled grass before him and following the movements of a green beetle advancing along a blade of couch grass and lifting up in its progress a leaf of goat weed 
 what have i discovered  
he asked himself bending aside the leaf of goat weed out of the beetle s way and twisting another blade of grass above for the beetle to cross over onto it 
 what is it makes me glad 
what have i discovered 
 i have discovered nothing 
i have only found out what i knew 
i understand the force that in the past gave me life and now too gives me life 
i have been set free from falsity i have found the master 
 of old i used to say that in my body that in the body of this grass and of this beetle there she didn t care for the grass she s opened her wings and flown away  there was going on a transformation of matter in accordance with physical chemical and physiological laws 
and in all of us as well as in the aspens and the clouds and the misty patches there was a process of evolution 
evolution from what 
into what   eternal evolution and struggle     as though there could be any sort of tendency and struggle in the eternal 
and i was astonished that in spite of the utmost effort of thought along that road i could not discover the meaning of life the meaning of my impulses and yearnings 
now i say that i know the meaning of my life to live for god for my soul  
and this meaning in spite of its clearness is mysterious and marvelous 
such indeed is the meaning of everything existing 
yes pride  he said to himself turning over on his stomach and beginning to tie a noose of blades of grass trying not to break them 
 and not merely pride of intellect but dulness of intellect 
and most of all the deceitfulness yes the deceitfulness of intellect 
the cheating knavishness of intellect that s it  he said to himself 
and he briefly went through mentally the whole course of his ideas during the last two years the beginning of which was the clear confronting of death at the sight of his dear brother hopelessly ill  then for the first time grasping that for every man and himself too there was nothing in store but suffering death and forgetfulness he had made up his mind that life was impossible like that and that he must either interpret life so that it would not present itself to him as the evil jest of some devil or shoot himself 
but he had not done either but had gone on living thinking and feeling and had even at that very time married and had had many joys and had been happy when he was not thinking of the meaning of his life 
what did this mean 
it meant that he had been living rightly but thinking wrongly 
he had lived without being aware of it on those spiritual truths that he had sucked in with his mother s milk but he had thought not merely without recognition of these truths but studiously ignoring them 
now it was clear to him that he could only live by virtue of the beliefs in which he had been brought up 
 what should i have been and how should i have spent my life if i had not had these beliefs if i had not known that i must live for god and not for my own desires 
i should have robbed and lied and killed 
nothing of what makes the chief happiness of my life would have existed for me  
and with the utmost stretch of imagination he could not conceive the brutal creature he would have been himself if he had not known what he was living for 
 i looked for an answer to my question 
and thought could not give an answer to my question  it is incommensurable with my question 
the answer has been given me by life itself in my knowledge of what is right and what is wrong 
and that knowledge i did not arrive at in any way it was given to me as to all men  given  because i could not have got it from anywhere 
 where could i have got it 
by reason could i have arrived at knowing that i must love my neighbor and not oppress him 
i was told that in my childhood and i believed it gladly for they told me what was already in my soul 
but who discovered it 
not reason 
reason discovered the struggle for existence and the law that requires us to oppress all who hinder the satisfaction of our desires 
that is the deduction of reason 
but loving one s neighbor reason could never discover because it s irrational  
chapter    and levin remembered a scene he had lately witnessed between dolly and her children 
the children left to themselves had begun cooking raspberries over the candles and squirting milk into each other s mouths with a syringe 
their mother catching them at these pranks began reminding them in levin s presence of the trouble their mischief gave to the grown up people and that this trouble was all for their sake and that if they smashed the cups they would have nothing to drink their tea out of and that if they wasted the milk they would have nothing to eat and die of hunger 
and levin had been struck by the passive weary incredulity with which the children heard what their mother said to them 
they were simply annoyed that their amusing play had been interrupted and did not believe a word of what their mother was saying 
they could not believe it indeed for they could not take in the immensity of all they habitually enjoyed and so could not conceive that what they were destroying was the very thing they lived by 
 that all comes of itself  they thought and there s nothing interesting or important about it because it has always been so and always will be so 
and it s all always the same 
we ve no need to think about that it s all ready 
but we want to invent something of our own and new 
so we thought of putting raspberries in a cup and cooking them over a candle and squirting milk straight into each other s mouths 
that s fun and something new and not a bit worse than drinking out of cups  
 isn t it just the same that we do that i did searching by the aid of reason for the significance of the forces of nature and the meaning of the life of man  
he thought 
 and don t all the theories of philosophy do the same trying by the path of thought which is strange and not natural to man to bring him to a knowledge of what he has known long ago and knows so certainly that he could not live at all without it 
isn t it distinctly to be seen in the development of each philosopher s theory that he knows what is the chief significance of life beforehand just as positively as the peasant fyodor and not a bit more clearly than he and is simply trying by a dubious intellectual path to come back to what everyone knows 
 now then leave the children to themselves to get things alone and make their crockery get the milk from the cows and so on 
would they be naughty then 
why they d die of hunger 
well then leave us with our passions and thoughts without any idea of the one god of the creator or without any idea of what is right without any idea of moral evil 
 just try and build up anything without those ideas 
 we only try to destroy them because we re spiritually provided for 
exactly like the children 
 whence have i that joyful knowledge shared with the peasant that alone gives peace to my soul 
whence did i get it 
 brought up with an idea of god a christian my whole life filled with the spiritual blessings christianity has given me full of them and living on those blessings like the children i did not understand them and destroy that is try to destroy what i live by 
and as soon as an important moment of life comes like the children when they are cold and hungry i turn to him and even less than the children when their mother scolds them for their childish mischief do i feel that my childish efforts at wanton madness are reckoned against me 
 yes what i know i know not by reason but it has been given to me revealed to me and i know it with my heart by faith in the chief thing taught by the church 
 the church 
the church  
levin repeated to himself 
he turned over on the other side and leaning on his elbow fell to gazing into the distance at a herd of cattle crossing over to the river 
 but can i believe in all the church teaches  
he thought trying himself and thinking of everything that could destroy his present peace of mind 
intentionally he recalled all those doctrines of the church which had always seemed most strange and had always been a stumbling block to him 
 the creation 
but how did i explain existence 
by existence 
by nothing 
the devil and sin 
but how do i explain evil    
the atonement    
 but i know nothing nothing and i can know nothing but what has been told to me and all men  
and it seemed to him that there was not a single article of faith of the church which could destroy the chief thing  faith in god in goodness as the one goal of man s destiny 
under every article of faith of the church could be put the faith in the service of truth instead of one s desires 
and each doctrine did not simply leave that faith unshaken each doctrine seemed essential to complete that great miracle continually manifest upon earth that made it possible for each man and millions of different sorts of men wise men and imbeciles old men and children  all men peasants lvov kitty beggars and kings to understand perfectly the same one thing and to build up thereby that life of the soul which alone is worth living and which alone is precious to us 
lying on his back he gazed up now into the high cloudless sky 
 do i not know that that is infinite space and that it is not a round arch 
but however i screw up my eyes and strain my sight i cannot see it not round and not bounded and in spite of my knowing about infinite space i am incontestably right when i see a solid blue dome and more right than when i strain my eyes to see beyond it  
levin ceased thinking and only as it were listened to mysterious voices that seemed talking joyfully and earnestly within him 
 can this be faith  
he thought afraid to believe in his happiness 
 my god i thank thee  
he said gulping down his sobs and with both hands brushing away the tears that filled his eyes 
chapter    levin looked before him and saw a herd of cattle then he caught sight of his trap with raven in the shafts and the coachman who driving up to the herd said something to the herdsman 
then he heard the rattle of the wheels and the snort of the sleek horse close by him 
but he was so buried in his thoughts that he did not even wonder why the coachman had come for him 
he only thought of that when the coachman had driven quite up to him and shouted to him 
 the mistress sent me 
your brother has come and some gentleman with him  
levin got into the trap and took the reins 
as though just roused out of sleep for a long while levin could not collect his faculties 
he stared at the sleek horse flecked with lather between his haunches and on his neck where the harness rubbed stared at ivan the coachman sitting beside him and remembered that he was expecting his brother thought that his wife was most likely uneasy at his long absence and tried to guess who was the visitor who had come with his brother 
and his brother and his wife and the unknown guest seemed to him now quite different from before 
he fancied that now his relations with all men would be different 
 with my brother there will be none of that aloofness there always used to be between us there will be no disputes with kitty there shall never be quarrels with the visitor whoever he may be i will be friendly and nice with the servants with ivan it will all be different  
pulling the stiff rein and holding in the good horse that snorted with impatience and seemed begging to be let go levin looked round at ivan sitting beside him not knowing what to do with his unoccupied hand continually pressing down his shirt as it puffed out and he tried to find something to start a conversation about with him 
he would have said that ivan had pulled the saddle girth up too high but that was like blame and he longed for friendly warm talk 
nothing else occurred to him 
 your honor must keep to the right and mind that stump  said the coachman pulling the rein levin held 
 please don t touch and don t teach me  
said levin angered by this interference 
now as always interference made him angry and he felt sorrowfully at once how mistaken had been his supposition that his spiritual condition could immediately change him in contact with reality 
he was not a quarter of a mile from home when he saw grisha and tanya running to meet him 
 uncle kostya 
mamma s coming and grandfather and sergey ivanovitch and someone else  they said clambering up into the trap 
 who is he  
 an awfully terrible person 
and he does like this with his arms  said tanya getting up in the trap and mimicking katavasov 
 old or young  
asked levin laughing reminded of someone he did not know whom by tanya s performance 
 oh i hope it s not a tiresome person  
thought levin 
as soon as he turned at a bend in the road and saw the party coming levin recognized katavasov in a straw hat walking along swinging his arms just as tanya had shown him 
katavasov was very fond of discussing metaphysics having derived his notions from natural science writers who had never studied metaphysics and in moscow levin had had many arguments with him of late 
and one of these arguments in which katavasov had obviously considered that he came off victorious was the first thing levin thought of as he recognized him 
 no whatever i do i won t argue and give utterance to my ideas lightly  he thought 
getting out of the trap and greeting his brother and katavasov levin asked about his wife 
 she has taken mitya to kolok a copse near the house  
 she meant to have him out there because it s so hot indoors  said dolly 
levin had always advised his wife not to take the baby to the wood thinking it unsafe and he was not pleased to hear this 
 she rushes about from place to place with him  said the prince smiling 
 i advised her to try putting him in the ice cellar  
 she meant to come to the bee house 
she thought you would be there 
we are going there  said dolly 
 well and what are you doing  
said sergey ivanovitch falling back from the rest and walking beside him 
 oh nothing special 
busy as usual with the land  answered levin 
 well and what about you 
come for long 
we have been expecting you for such a long time  
 only for a fortnight 
i ve a great deal to do in moscow  
at these words the brothers eyes met and levin in spite of the desire he always had stronger than ever just now to be on affectionate and still more open terms with his brother felt an awkwardness in looking at him 
he dropped his eyes and did not know what to say 
casting over the subjects of conversation that would be pleasant to sergey ivanovitch and would keep him off the subject of the servian war and the slavonic question at which he had hinted by the allusion to what he had to do in moscow levin began to talk of sergey ivanovitch s book 
 well have there been reviews of your book  
he asked 
sergey ivanovitch smiled at the intentional character of the question 
 no one is interested in that now and i less than anyone  he said 
 just look darya alexandrovna we shall have a shower  he added pointing with a sunshade at the white rain clouds that showed above the aspen tree tops 
and these words were enough to re establish again between the brothers that tone  hardly hostile but chilly  which levin had been so longing to avoid 
levin went up to katavasov 
 it was jolly of you to make up your mind to come  he said to him 
 i ve been meaning to a long while 
now we shall have some discussion we ll see to that 
have you been reading spencer  
 no i ve not finished reading him  said levin 
 but i don t need him now  
 how s that 
that s interesting 
why so  
 i mean that i m fully convinced that the solution of the problems that interest me i shall never find in him and his like 
now     but katavasov s serene and good humored expression suddenly struck him and he felt such tenderness for his own happy mood which he was unmistakably disturbing by this conversation that he remembered his resolution and stopped short 
 but we ll talk later on  he added 
 if we re going to the bee house it s this way along this little path  he said addressing them all 
going along the narrow path to a little uncut meadow covered on one side with thick clumps of brilliant heart s ease among which stood up here and there tall dark green tufts of hellebore levin settled his guests in the dense cool shade of the young aspens on a bench and some stumps purposely put there for visitors to the bee house who might be afraid of the bees and he went off himself to the hut to get bread cucumbers and fresh honey to regale them with 
trying to make his movements as deliberate as possible and listening to the bees that buzzed more and more frequently past him he walked along the little path to the hut 
in the very entry one bee hummed angrily caught in his beard but he carefully extricated it 
going into the shady outer room he took down from the wall his veil that hung on a peg and putting it on and thrusting his hands into his pockets he went into the fenced in bee garden where there stood in the midst of a closely mown space in regular rows fastened with bast on posts all the hives he knew so well the old stocks each with its own history and along the fences the younger swarms hived that year 
in front of the openings of the hives it made his eyes giddy to watch the bees and drones whirling round and round about the same spot while among them the working bees flew in and out with spoils or in search of them always in the same direction into the wood to the flowering lime trees and back to the hives 
his ears were filled with the incessant hum in various notes now the busy hum of the working bee flying quickly off then the blaring of the lazy drone and the excited buzz of the bees on guard protecting their property from the enemy and preparing to sting 
on the farther side of the fence the old bee keeper was shaving a hoop for a tub and he did not see levin 
levin stood still in the midst of the beehives and did not call him 
he was glad of a chance to be alone to recover from the influence of ordinary actual life which had already depressed his happy mood 
he thought that he had already had time to lose his temper with ivan to show coolness to his brother and to talk flippantly with katavasov 
 can it have been only a momentary mood and will it pass and leave no trace  
he thought 
but the same instant going back to his mood he felt with delight that something new and important had happened to him 
real life had only for a time overcast the spiritual peace he had found but it was still untouched within him 
just as the bees whirling round him now menacing him and distracting his attention prevented him from enjoying complete physical peace forced him to restrain his movements to avoid them so had the petty cares that had swarmed about him from the moment he got into the trap restricted his spiritual freedom but that lasted only so long as he was among them 
just as his bodily strength was still unaffected in spite of the bees so too was the spiritual strength that he had just become aware of 
chapter    do you know kostya with whom sergey ivanovitch traveled on his way here  
said dolly doling out cucumbers and honey to the children with vronsky 
he s going to servia  
 and not alone he s taking a squadron out with him at his own expense  said katavasov 
 that s the right thing for him  said levin 
 are volunteers still going out then  
he added glancing at sergey ivanovitch 
sergey ivanovitch did not answer 
he was carefully with a blunt knife getting a live bee covered with sticky honey out of a cup full of white honeycomb 
 i should think so 
you should have seen what was going on at the station yesterday  
said katavasov biting with a juicy sound into a cucumber 
 well what is one to make of it 
for mercy s sake do explain to me sergey ivanovitch where are all those volunteers going whom are they fighting with  
asked the old prince unmistakably taking up a conversation that had sprung up in levin s absence 
 with the turks  sergey ivanovitch answered smiling serenely as he extricated the bee dark with honey and helplessly kicking and put it with the knife on a stout aspen leaf 
 but who has declared war on the turks   ivan ivanovitch ragozov and countess lidia ivanovna assisted by madame stahl  
 no one has declared war but people sympathize with their neighbors sufferings and are eager to help them  said sergey ivanovitch 
 but the prince is not speaking of help  said levin coming to the assistance of his father in law but of war 
the prince says that private persons cannot take part in war without the permission of the government  
 kostya mind that s a bee 
really they ll sting us  
said dolly waving away a wasp 
 but that s not a bee it s a wasp  said levin 
 well now well what s your own theory  
katavasov said to levin with a smile distinctly challenging him to a discussion 
 why have not private persons the right to do so  
 oh my theory s this war is on one side such a beastly cruel and awful thing that no one man not to speak of a christian can individually take upon himself the responsibility of beginning wars that can only be done by a government which is called upon to do this and is driven inevitably into war 
on the other hand both political science and common sense teach us that in matters of state and especially in the matter of war private citizens must forego their personal individual will  
sergey ivanovitch and katavasov had their replies ready and both began speaking at the same time 
 but the point is my dear fellow that there may be cases when the government does not carry out the will of the citizens and then the public asserts its will  said katavasov 
but evidently sergey ivanovitch did not approve of this answer 
his brows contracted at katavasov s words and he said something else 
 you don t put the matter in its true light 
there is no question here of a declaration of war but simply the expression of a human christian feeling 
our brothers one with us in religion and in race are being massacred 
even supposing they were not our brothers nor fellow christians but simply children women old people feeling is aroused and russians go eagerly to help in stopping these atrocities 
fancy if you were going along the street and saw drunken men beating a woman or a child  i imagine you would not stop to inquire whether war had been declared on the men but would throw yourself on them and protect the victim  
 but i should not kill them  said levin 
 yes you would kill them  
 i don t know 
if i saw that i might give way to my impulse of the moment but i can t say beforehand 
and such a momentary impulse there is not and there cannot be in the case of the oppression of the slavonic peoples  
 possibly for you there is not but for others there is  said sergey ivanovitch frowning with displeasure 
 there are traditions still extant among the people of slavs of the true faith suffering under the yoke of the unclean sons of hagar  
the people have heard of the sufferings of their brethren and have spoken  
 perhaps so  said levin evasively but i don t see it 
i m one of the people myself and i don t feel it  
 here am i too  said the old prince 
 i ve been staying abroad and reading the papers and i must own up to the time of the bulgarian atrocities i couldn t make out why it was all the russians were all of a sudden so fond of their slavonic brethren while i didn t feel the slightest affection for them 
i was very much upset thought i was a monster or that it was the influence of carlsbad on me 
but since i have been here my mind s been set at rest 
i see that there are people besides me who re only interested in russia and not in their slavonic brethren 
here s konstantin too  
 personal opinions mean nothing in such a case  said sergey ivanovitch it s not a matter of personal opinions when all russia  the whole people  has expressed its will  
 but excuse me i don t see that 
the people don t know anything about it if you come to that  said the old prince 
 oh papa    how can you say that 
and last sunday in church  
said dolly listening to the conversation 
 please give me a cloth  she said to the old man who was looking at the children with a smile 
 why it s not possible that all     but what was it in church on sunday 
the priest had been told to read that 
he read it 
they didn t understand a word of it 
then they were told that there was to be a collection for a pious object in church well they pulled out their halfpence and gave them but what for they couldn t say  
 the people cannot help knowing the sense of their own destinies is always in the people and at such moments as the present that sense finds utterance  said sergey ivanovitch with conviction glancing at the old bee keeper 
the handsome old man with black grizzled beard and thick silvery hair stood motionless holding a cup of honey looking down from the height of his tall figure with friendly serenity at the gentlefolk obviously understanding nothing of their conversation and not caring to understand it 
 that s so no doubt  he said with a significant shake of his head at sergey ivanovitch s words 
 here then ask him 
he knows nothing about it and thinks nothing  said levin 
 have you heard about the war mihalitch  
he said turning to him 
 what they read in the church 
what do you think about it 
ought we to fight for the christians  
 what should we think 
alexander nikolaevitch our emperor has thought for us he thinks for us indeed in all things 
it s clearer for him to see 
shall i bring a bit more bread 
give the little lad some more  
he said addressing darya alexandrovna and pointing to grisha who had finished his crust 
 i don t need to ask  said sergey ivanovitch we have seen and are seeing hundreds and hundreds of people who give up everything to serve a just cause come from every part of russia and directly and clearly express their thought and aim 
they bring their halfpence or go themselves and say directly what for 
what does it mean  
 it means to my thinking  said levin who was beginning to get warm that among eighty millions of people there can always be found not hundreds as now but tens of thousands of people who have lost caste ne er do wells who are always ready to go anywhere  to pogatchev s bands to khiva to serbia     i tell you that it s not a case of hundreds or of ne er do wells but the best representatives of the people  
said sergey ivanovitch with as much irritation as if he were defending the last penny of his fortune 
 and what of the subscriptions 
in this case it is a whole people directly expressing their will  
 that word people is so vague  said levin 
 parish clerks teachers and one in a thousand of the peasants maybe know what it s all about 
the rest of the eighty millions like mihalitch far from expressing their will haven t the faintest idea what there is for them to express their will about 
what right have we to say that this is the people s will  
chapter    sergey ivanovitch being practiced in argument did not reply but at once turned the conversation to another aspect of the subject 
 oh if you want to learn the spirit of the people by arithmetical computation of course it s very difficult to arrive at it 
and voting has not been introduced among us and cannot be introduced for it does not express the will of the people but there are other ways of reaching that 
it is felt in the air it is felt by the heart 
i won t speak of those deep currents which are astir in the still ocean of the people and which are evident to every unprejudiced man let us look at society in the narrow sense 
all the most diverse sections of the educated public hostile before are merged in one 
every division is at an end all the public organs say the same thing over and over again all feel the mighty torrent that has overtaken them and is carrying them in one direction  
 yes all the newspapers do say the same thing  said the prince 
 that s true 
but so it is the same thing that all the frogs croak before a storm 
one can hear nothing for them  
 frogs or no frogs i m not the editor of a paper and i don t want to defend them but i am speaking of the unanimity in the intellectual world  said sergey ivanovitch addressing his brother 
levin would have answered but the old prince interrupted him 
 well about that unanimity that s another thing one may say  said the prince 
 there s my son in law stepan arkadyevitch you know him 
he s got a place now on the committee of a commission and something or other i don t remember 
only there s nothing to do in it  why dolly it s no secret   and a salary of eight thousand 
you try asking him whether his post is of use he ll prove to you that it s most necessary 
and he s a truthful man too but there s no refusing to believe in the utility of eight thousand roubles  
 yes he asked me to give a message to darya alexandrovna about the post  said sergey ivanovitch reluctantly feeling the prince s remark to be ill timed 
 so it is with the unanimity of the press 
that s been explained to me as soon as there s war their incomes are doubled 
how can they help believing in the destinies of the people and the slavonic races   and all that  
 i don t care for many of the papers but that s unjust  said sergey ivanovitch 
 i would only make one condition  pursued the old prince 
 alphonse karr said a capital thing before the war with prussia you consider war to be inevitable 
very good 
let everyone who advocates war be enrolled in a special regiment of advance guards for the front of every storm of every attack to lead them all   
 a nice lot the editors would make  
said katavasov with a loud roar as he pictured the editors he knew in this picked legion 
 but they d run  said dolly they d only be in the way  
 oh if they ran away then we d have grape shot or cossacks with whips behind them  said the prince 
 but that s a joke and a poor one too if you ll excuse my saying so prince  said sergey ivanovitch 
 i don t see that it was a joke that    levin was beginning but sergey ivanovitch interrupted him 
 every member of society is called upon to do his own special work  said he 
 and men of thought are doing their work when they express public opinion 
and the single hearted and full expression of public opinion is the service of the press and a phenomenon to rejoice us at the same time 
twenty years ago we should have been silent but now we have heard the voice of the russian people which is ready to rise as one man and ready to sacrifice itself for its oppressed brethren that is a great step and a proof of strength  
 but it s not only making a sacrifice but killing turks  said levin timidly 
 the people make sacrifices and are ready to make sacrifices for their soul but not for murder  he added instinctively connecting the conversation with the ideas that had been absorbing his mind 
 for their soul 
that s a most puzzling expression for a natural science man do you understand 
what sort of thing is the soul  
said katavasov smiling 
 oh you know  
 no by god i haven t the faintest idea  
said katavasov with a loud roar of laughter 
  i bring not peace but a sword  says christ  sergey ivanovitch rejoined for his part quoting as simply as though it were the easiest thing to understand the very passage that had always puzzled levin most 
 that s so no doubt  the old man repeated again 
he was standing near them and responded to a chance glance turned in his direction 
 ah my dear fellow you re defeated utterly defeated  
cried katavasov good humoredly 
levin reddened with vexation not at being defeated but at having failed to control himself and being drawn into argument 
 no i can t argue with them  he thought they wear impenetrable armor while i m naked  
he saw that it was impossible to convince his brother and katavasov and he saw even less possibility of himself agreeing with them 
what they advocated was the very pride of intellect that had almost been his ruin 
he could not admit that some dozens of men among them his brother had the right on the ground of what they were told by some hundreds of glib volunteers swarming to the capital to say that they and the newspapers were expressing the will and feeling of the people and a feeling which was expressed in vengeance and murder 
he could not admit this because he neither saw the expression of such feelings in the people among whom he was living nor found them in himself and he could not but consider himself one of the persons making up the russian people  and most of all because he like the people did not know and could not know what is for the general good though he knew beyond a doubt that this general good could be attained only by the strict observance of that law of right and wrong which has been revealed to every man and therefore he could not wish for war or advocate war for any general objects whatever 
he said as mihalitch did and the people who had expressed their feeling in the traditional invitations of the varyagi be princes and rule over us 
gladly we promise complete submission 
all the labor all humiliations all sacrifices we take upon ourselves but we will not judge and decide  
and now according to sergey ivanovitch s account the people had foregone this privilege they had bought at such a costly price 
he wanted to say too that if public opinion were an infallible guide then why were not revolutions and the commune as lawful as the movement in favor of the slavonic peoples 
but these were merely thoughts that could settle nothing 
one thing could be seen beyond doubt  that was that at the actual moment the discussion was irritating sergey ivanovitch and so it was wrong to continue it 
and levin ceased speaking and then called the attention of his guests to the fact that the storm clouds were gathering and that they had better be going home before it rained 
chapter    the old prince and sergey ivanovitch got into the trap and drove off the rest of the party hastened homewards on foot 
but the storm clouds turning white and then black moved down so quickly that they had to quicken their pace to get home before the rain 
the foremost clouds lowering and black as soot laden smoke rushed with extraordinary swiftness over the sky 
they were still two hundred paces from home and a gust of wind had already blown up and every second the downpour might be looked for 
the children ran ahead with frightened and gleeful shrieks 
darya alexandrovna struggling painfully with her skirts that clung round her legs was not walking but running her eyes fixed on the children 
the men of the party holding their hats on strode with long steps beside her 
they were just at the steps when a big drop fell splashing on the edge of the iron guttering 
the children and their elders after them ran into the shelter of the house talking merrily 
 katerina alexandrovna  
levin asked of agafea mihalovna who met them with kerchiefs and rugs in the hall 
 we thought she was with you  she said 
 and mitya  
 in the copse he must be and the nurse with him  
levin snatched up the rugs and ran towards the copse 
in that brief interval of time the storm clouds had moved on covering the sun so completely that it was dark as an eclipse 
stubbornly as though insisting on its rights the wind stopped levin and tearing the leaves and flowers off the lime trees and stripping the white birch branches into strange unseemly nakedness it twisted everything on one side  acacias flowers burdocks long grass and tall tree tops 
the peasant girls working in the garden ran shrieking into shelter in the servants quarters 
the streaming rain had already flung its white veil over all the distant forest and half the fields close by and was rapidly swooping down upon the copse 
the wet of the rain spurting up in tiny drops could be smelt in the air 
holding his head bent down before him and struggling with the wind that strove to tear the wraps away from him levin was moving up to the copse and had just caught sight of something white behind the oak tree when there was a sudden flash the whole earth seemed on fire and the vault of heaven seemed crashing overhead 
opening his blinded eyes levin gazed through the thick veil of rain that separated him now from the copse and to his horror the first thing he saw was the green crest of the familiar oak tree in the middle of the copse uncannily changing its position 
 can it have been struck  
levin hardly had time to think when moving more and more rapidly the oak tree vanished behind the other trees and he heard the crash of the great tree falling upon the others 
the flash of lightning the crash of thunder and the instantaneous chill that ran through him were all merged for levin in one sense of terror 
 my god 
my god 
not on them  
he said 
and though he thought at once how senseless was his prayer that they should not have been killed by the oak which had fallen now he repeated it knowing that he could do nothing better than utter this senseless prayer 
running up to the place where they usually went he did not find them there 
they were at the other end of the copse under an old lime tree they were calling him 
two figures in dark dresses they had been light summer dresses when they started out were standing bending over something 
it was kitty with the nurse 
the rain was already ceasing and it was beginning to get light when levin reached them 
the nurse was not wet on the lower part of her dress but kitty was drenched through and her soaked clothes clung to her 
though the rain was over they still stood in the same position in which they had been standing when the storm broke 
both stood bending over a perambulator with a green umbrella 
 alive 
unhurt 
thank god  
he said splashing with his soaked boots through the standing water and running up to them 
kitty s rosy wet face was turned towards him and she smiled timidly under her shapeless sopped hat 
 aren t you ashamed of yourself 
i can t think how you can be so reckless  
he said angrily to his wife 
 it wasn t my fault really 
we were just meaning to go when he made such a to do that we had to change him 
we were just    kitty began defending herself 
mitya was unharmed dry and still fast asleep 
 well thank god 
i don t know what i m saying  
they gathered up the baby s wet belongings the nurse picked up the baby and carried it 
levin walked beside his wife and penitent for having been angry he squeezed her hand when the nurse was not looking 
chapter    during the whole of that day in the extremely different conversations in which he took part only as it were with the top layer of his mind in spite of the disappointment of not finding the change he expected in himself levin had been all the while joyfully conscious of the fulness of his heart 
after the rain it was too wet to go for a walk besides the storm clouds still hung about the horizon and gathered here and there black and thundery on the rim of the sky 
the whole party spent the rest of the day in the house 
no more discussions sprang up on the contrary after dinner every one was in the most amiable frame of mind 
at first katavasov amused the ladies by his original jokes which always pleased people on their first acquaintance with him 
then sergey ivanovitch induced him to tell them about the very interesting observations he had made on the habits and characteristics of common houseflies and their life 
sergey ivanovitch too was in good spirits and at tea his brother drew him on to explain his views of the future of the eastern question and he spoke so simply and so well that everyone listened eagerly 
kitty was the only one who did not hear it all  she was summoned to give mitya his bath 
a few minutes after kitty had left the room she sent for levin to come to the nursery 
leaving his tea and regretfully interrupting the interesting conversation and at the same time uneasily wondering why he had been sent for as this only happened on important occasions levin went to the nursery 
although he had been much interested by sergey ivanovitch s views of the new epoch in history that would be created by the emancipation of forty millions of men of slavonic race acting with russia a conception quite new to him and although he was disturbed by uneasy wonder at being sent for by kitty as soon as he came out of the drawing room and was alone his mind reverted at once to the thoughts of the morning 
and all the theories of the significance of the slav element in the history of the world seemed to him so trivial compared with what was passing in his own soul that he instantly forgot it all and dropped back into the same frame of mind that he had been in that morning 
he did not as he had done at other times recall the whole train of thought  that he did not need 
he fell back at once into the feeling which had guided him which was connected with those thoughts and he found that feeling in his soul even stronger and more definite than before 
he did not as he had had to do with previous attempts to find comforting arguments need to revive a whole chain of thought to find the feeling 
now on the contrary the feeling of joy and peace was keener than ever and thought could not keep pace with feeling 
he walked across the terrace and looked at two stars that had come out in the darkening sky and suddenly he remembered 
 yes looking at the sky i thought that the dome that i see is not a deception and then i thought something i shirked facing something  he mused 
 but whatever it was there can be no disproving it 
i have but to think and all will come clear  
just as he was going into the nursery he remembered what it was he had shirked facing 
it was that if the chief proof of the divinity was his revelation of what is right how is it this revelation is confined to the christian church alone 
what relation to this revelation have the beliefs of the buddhists mohammedans who preached and did good too 
it seemed to him that he had an answer to this question but he had not time to formulate it to himself before he went into the nursery 
kitty was standing with her sleeves tucked up over the baby in the bath 
hearing her husband s footstep she turned towards him summoning him to her with her smile 
with one hand she was supporting the fat baby that lay floating and sprawling on its back while with the other she squeezed the sponge over him 
 come look look  
she said when her husband came up to her 
 agafea mihalovna s right 
he knows us  
mitya had on that day given unmistakable incontestable signs of recognizing all his friends 
as soon as levin approached the bath the experiment was tried and it was completely successful 
the cook sent for with this object bent over the baby 
he frowned and shook his head disapprovingly 
kitty bent down to him he gave her a beaming smile propped his little hands on the sponge and chirruped making such a queer little contented sound with his lips that kitty and the nurse were not alone in their admiration 
levin too was surprised and delighted 
the baby was taken out of the bath drenched with water wrapped in towels dried and after a piercing scream handed to his mother 
 well i am glad you are beginning to love him  said kitty to her husband when she had settled herself comfortably in her usual place with the baby at her breast 
 i am so glad 
it had begun to distress me 
you said you had no feeling for him  
 no did i say that 
i only said i was disappointed  
 what 
disappointed in him  
 not disappointed in him but in my own feeling i had expected more 
i had expected a rush of new delightful emotion to come as a surprise 
and then instead of that  disgust pity     she listened attentively looking at him over the baby while she put back on her slender fingers the rings she had taken off while giving mitya his bath 
 and most of all at there being far more apprehension and pity than pleasure 
today after that fright during the storm i understand how i love him  
kitty s smile was radiant 
 were you very much frightened  
she said 
 so was i too but i feel it more now that it s over 
i m going to look at the oak 
how nice katavasov is 
and what a happy day we ve had altogether 
and you re so nice with sergey ivanovitch when you care to be     well go back to them 
it s always so hot and steamy here after the bath  
chapter    going out of the nursery and being again alone levin went back at once to the thought in which there was something not clear 
instead of going into the drawing room where he heard voices he stopped on the terrace and leaning his elbows on the parapet he gazed up at the sky 
it was quite dark now and in the south where he was looking there were no clouds 
the storm had drifted on to the opposite side of the sky and there were flashes of lightning and distant thunder from that quarter 
levin listened to the monotonous drip from the lime trees in the garden and looked at the triangle of stars he knew so well and the milky way with its branches that ran through its midst 
at each flash of lightning the milky way and even the bright stars vanished but as soon as the lightning died away they reappeared in their places as though some hand had flung them back with careful aim 
 well what is it perplexes me  
levin said to himself feeling beforehand that the solution of his difficulties was ready in his soul though he did not know it yet 
 yes the one unmistakable incontestable manifestation of the divinity is the law of right and wrong which has come into the world by revelation and which i feel in myself and in the recognition of which  i don t make myself but whether i will or not  i am made one with other men in one body of believers which is called the church 
well but the jews the mohammedans the confucians the buddhists  what of them  
he put to himself the question he had feared to face 
 can these hundreds of millions of men be deprived of that highest blessing without which life has no meaning  
he pondered a moment but immediately corrected himself 
 but what am i questioning  
he said to himself 
 i am questioning the relation to divinity of all the different religions of all mankind 
i am questioning the universal manifestation of god to all the world with all those misty blurs 
what am i about 
to me individually to my heart has been revealed a knowledge beyond all doubt and unattainable by reason and here i am obstinately trying to express that knowledge in reason and words 
 don t i know that the stars don t move  
he asked himself gazing at the bright planet which had shifted its position up to the topmost twig of the birch tree 
 but looking at the movements of the stars i can t picture to myself the rotation of the earth and i m right in saying that the stars move 
 and could the astronomers have understood and calculated anything if they had taken into account all the complicated and varied motions of the earth 
all the marvelous conclusions they have reached about the distances weights movements and deflections of the heavenly bodies are only founded on the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies about a stationary earth on that very motion i see before me now which has been so for millions of men during long ages and was and will be always alike and can always be trusted 
and just as the conclusions of the astronomers would have been vain and uncertain if not founded on observations of the seen heavens in relation to a single meridian and a single horizon so would my conclusions be vain and uncertain if not founded on that conception of right which has been and will be always alike for all men which has been revealed to me as a christian and which can always be trusted in my soul 
the question of other religions and their relations to divinity i have no right to decide and no possibility of deciding  
 oh you haven t gone in then  
he heard kitty s voice all at once as she came by the same way to the drawing room 
 what is it 
you re not worried about anything  
she said looking intently at his face in the starlight 
but she could not have seen his face if a flash of lightning had not hidden the stars and revealed it 
in that flash she saw his face distinctly and seeing him calm and happy she smiled at him 
 she understands  he thought she knows what i m thinking about 
shall i tell her or not 
yes i ll tell her  
but at the moment he was about to speak she began speaking 
 kostya 
do something for me  she said go into the corner room and see if they ve made it all right for sergey ivanovitch 
i can t very well 
see if they ve put the new wash stand in it  
 very well i ll go directly  said levin standing up and kissing her 
 no i d better not speak of it  he thought when she had gone in before him 
 it is a secret for me alone of vital importance for me and not to be put into words 
 this new feeling has not changed me has not made me happy and enlightened all of a sudden as i had dreamed just like the feeling for my child 
there was no surprise in this either 
faith  or not faith  i don t know what it is  but this feeling has come just as imperceptibly through suffering and has taken firm root in my soul 
 i shall go on in the same way losing my temper with ivan the coachman falling into angry discussions expressing my opinions tactlessly there will be still the same wall between the holy of holies of my soul and other people even my wife i shall still go on scolding her for my own terror and being remorseful for it i shall still be as unable to understand with my reason why i pray and i shall still go on praying but my life now my whole life apart from anything that can happen to me every minute of it is no more meaningless as it was before but it has the positive meaning of goodness which i have the power to put into it
