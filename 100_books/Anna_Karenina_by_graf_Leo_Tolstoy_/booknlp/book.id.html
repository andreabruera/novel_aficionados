Karenina  by Leo Tolstoy     Translated by Constance Garnett     Part One    Chapter 1   Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
<p/>Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys' house.
<p/>The wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl, who had been a governess in their family, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had announced to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not go on living in the same house with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>This position of affairs had now lasted three days, and not only the husband and wife themselves, but all the members of their family and household, were painfully conscious of it.
<p/>Every person in the house felt that there was no sense in their living together, and that the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they, the members of the family and household of the Oblonskys.
<p/>The wife did not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own room, the husband had not been at home for three days.
<p/>The children ran wild all over the house; the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper, and wrote to a friend asking her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) to look out for a new situation for her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>); the man-cook had walked off the day before just at dinner time; the kitchen-maid, and the coachman had given warning.
<p/>Three days after the quarrel, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky--Stiva, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was called in the fashionable world-- woke up at his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) usual hour, that is, at eight o'clock in the morning, not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife's bedroom, but on the leather-covered sofa in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) study.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) turned over his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) stout, well-cared-for person on the springy sofa, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) would sink into a long sleep again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) vigorously embraced the pillow on the other side and buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) face in it; but all at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) jumped up, sat up on the sofa, and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, how was it now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) thought, going over his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) dream.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, how was it?
<p/>To be sure!
<p/>Alabin was giving a dinner at Darmstadt; no, not Darmstadt, but something American.
<p/>Yes, but then, Darmstadt was in America.
<p/>Yes, Alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables, and the tables sang,  Il mio tesoro --not  Il mio tesoro  though, but something better, and there were some sort of little decanters on the table, and they were women, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) remembered.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch's eyes twinkled gaily, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) pondered with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was nice, very nice.
<p/>There was a great deal more that was delightful, only there's no putting it into words, or even expressing it in one's thoughts awake.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And noticing a gleam of light peeping in beside one of the serge curtains, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) cheerfully dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) feet over the edge of the sofa, and felt about with them for his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) slippers, a present on his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) last birthday, worked for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife on gold-colored morocco.
<p/>And, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had done every day for the last nine years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hand, without getting up, towards the place where his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) dressing-gown always hung in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) bedroom.
<p/>And thereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) suddenly remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was not sleeping in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife's room, but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) study, and why: the smile vanished from his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) knitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) brows.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, ah, ah!
<p/>Oo!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) muttered, recalling everything that had happened.
<p/>And again every detail of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) quarrel with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife was present to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) imagination, all the hopelessness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) position, and worst of all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own fault.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) won't forgive me, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) can't forgive me.
<p/>And the most awful thing about it is that it's all my fault--all my fault, though I'm not to blame.
<p/>That's the point of the whole situation,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) reflected.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh, oh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) kept repeating in despair, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) remembered the acutely painful sensations caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) by this quarrel.
<p/>Most unpleasant of all was the first minute when, on coming, happy and good-humored, from the theater, with a huge pear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hand for his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had not found his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife in the drawing-room, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) surprise had not found her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in the study either, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at last in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bedroom with the unlucky letter that revealed everything in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) Dolly, forever fussing and worrying over household details, and limited in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) ideas, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) considered, was sitting perfectly still with the letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) hand, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) with an expression of horror, despair, and indignation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's this?
<p/>this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) asked, pointing to the letter.
<p/>And at this recollection, Stepan Arkadyevitch, as is so often the case, was not so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had met his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife's words.
<p/>There happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) at that instant what does happen to people when they are unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) did not succeed in adapting his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) face to the position in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was placed towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife by the discovery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) fault.
<p/>Instead of being hurt, denying, defending himself, begging forgiveness, instead of remaining indifferent even--anything would have been better than what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) did do--his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) face utterly involuntarily -LRB-reflex spinal action, reflected Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was fond of physiology-RRB---utterly involuntarily assumed its habitual, good-humored, and therefore idiotic smile.
<p/>This idiotic smile he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could not forgive himself.
<p/>Catching sight of that smile, Dolly shuddered as though at physical pain, broke out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) characteristic heat into a flood of cruel words, and rushed out of the room.
<p/>Since then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had refused to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) husband.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's that idiotic smile that's to blame for it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>thought Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what's to be done?
<p/>What's to be done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said to himself in despair, and found no answer.
<p/>Chapter 2   Stepan Arkadyevitch was a truthful man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) relations with himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was incapable of deceiving himself and persuading himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repented of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conduct.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not at this date repent of the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), a handsome, susceptible man of thirty-four, was not in love with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, the mother of five living and two dead children, and only a year younger than himself.
<p/>All he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repented of was that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not succeeded better in hiding it from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt all the difficulty of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position and was sorry for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children, and himself.
<p/>Possibly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have managed to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sins better from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had anticipated that the knowledge of them would have had such an effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never clearly thought out the subject, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had vaguely conceived that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife must long ago have suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of being unfaithful to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and shut her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes to the fact.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had even supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), a worn-out woman no longer young or good-looking, and in no way remarkable or interesting, merely a good mother, ought from a sense of fairness to take an indulgent view.
<p/>It had turned out quite the other way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's awful!
<p/>oh dear, oh dear!
<p/>awful!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch kept repeating to himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could think of nothing to be done.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how well things were going up till now!
<p/>how well we got on!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was contented and happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children; I never interfered with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in anything; I let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) manage the children and the house just as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) liked.
<p/>It's true it's bad  her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)  having been a governess in our house.
<p/>That's bad!
<p/>There's something common, vulgar, in flirting with one's governess.
<p/>But what a governess!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vividly recalled the roguish black eyes of Mlle.
<p/>Roland and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) smile.-RRB-
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But after all, while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was in the house, I kept myself in hand.
<p/>And the worst of it all is that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s already...it seems as if ill-luck would have it so!
<p/>Oh, oh!
<p/>But what, what is to be done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no solution, but that universal solution which life gives to all questions, even the most complex and insoluble.
<p/>That answer is: one must live in the needs of the day--that is, forget oneself.
<p/>To forget himself in sleep was impossible now, at least till nighttime; he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) could not go back now to the music sung by the decanter-women; so he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) must forget himself in the dream of daily life.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we shall see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>Stepan Arkadyevitch said to himself, and getting up he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) put on a gray dressing-gown lined with blue silk, tied the tassels in a knot, and, drawing a deep breath of air into his (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) broad, bare chest, he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) walked to the window with his (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) usual confident step, turning out his (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) feet that carried his (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) full frame so easily.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) pulled up the blind and rang the bell loudly.
<p/>It was at once answered by the appearance of an old friend, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) valet, Matvey, carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) clothes, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) boots, and a telegram.
<p/>Matvey was followed by the barber with all the necessaries for shaving.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are there any papers from the office?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Stepan Arkadyevitch, taking the telegram and seating himself at the looking-glass.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the table,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matvey</b></font>)</div>replied Matvey, glancing with inquiring sympathy at his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) master; and, after a short pause, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) added with a sly smile, <div class="bookquote">``They've sent from the carriage-jobbers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch made no reply, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) merely glanced at Matvey in the looking-glass.
<p/>In the glance, in which their eyes met in the looking-glass, it was clear that they understood one another.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch's eyes asked: <div class="bookquote">``Why do you tell me that?
<p/>don't you know?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Matvey put his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) jacket pockets, thrust out one leg, and gazed silently, good-humoredly, with a faint smile, at his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) master.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told them to come on Sunday, and till then not to trouble you or themselves for nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had obviously prepared the sentence beforehand.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch saw Matvey wanted to make a joke and attract attention to himself.
<p/>Tearing open the telegram, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) read it through, guessing at the words, misspelt as they always are in telegrams, and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) face brightened.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Matvey, my sister Anna Arkadyevna will be here tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said, checking for a minute the sleek, plump hand of the barber, cutting a pink path through his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) long, curly whiskers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Matvey</b></font>)</div><p/>said Matvey, showing by this response that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), like his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) master, realized the significance of this arrival--that is, that Anna Arkadyevna, the sister he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was so fond of, might bring about a reconciliation between husband and wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alone, or with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Matvey</b></font>)</div><p/>inquired Matvey.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch could not answer, as the barber was at work on his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) upper lip, and he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) raised one finger.
<p/>Matvey nodded at the looking-glass.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alone.
<p/>Is the room to be got ready upstairs?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Inform Darya Alexandrovna: where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) orders.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Darya Alexandrovna?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Matvey repeated, as though in doubt.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, inform her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>Here, take the telegram; give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and then do what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tells you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You want to try it on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matvey</b></font>)</div>Matvey understood, but he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) only said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch was already washed and combed and ready to be dressed, when Matvey, stepping deliberately in his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) creaky boots, came back into the room with the telegram in his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) hand.
<p/>The barber had gone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Darya Alexandrovna told me to inform you that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is going away.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) do--that is you--do as he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) likes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) said, laughing only with his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) eyes, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) pockets, he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) master with his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) head on one side.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch was silent a minute.
<p/>Then a good-humored and rather pitiful smile showed itself on his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) handsome face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, Matvey?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right, sir; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will come round,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matvey</b></font>)</div>said Matvey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come round?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think so?
<p/>Who's there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Stepan Arkadyevitch, hearing the rustle of a woman's dress at the door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's I,''  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>said a firm, pleasant, woman's voice, and the stern, pockmarked face of Matrona Philimonovna, the nurse, was thrust in at the doorway.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what is it, Matrona?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>queried Stepan Arkadyevitch, going up to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) at the door.
<p/>Although Stepan Arkadyevitch was completely in the wrong as regards his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wife, and was conscious of this himself, almost every one in the house -LRB-even the nurse, Darya Alexandrovna's chief ally-RRB- was on his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) side.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked disconsolately.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>), sir; own your fault again.
<p/>Maybe God will aid you.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) is suffering so, it's sad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>); and besides, everything in the house is topsy-turvy.
<p/>You must have pity, sir, on the children.
<p/>Beg her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) forgiveness, sir.
<p/>There's no help for it!
<p/>One must take the consequences...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) won't see me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do your part.
<p/>God is merciful; pray to God, sir, pray to God.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, that'll do, you can go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, blushing suddenly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well now, do dress me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) turned to Matvey and threw off his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dressing-gown decisively.
<p/>Matvey was already holding up the shirt like a horse's collar, and, blowing off some invisible speck, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) slipped it with obvious pleasure over the well-groomed body of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) master.
<p/>Chapter 3   When he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was dressed, Stepan Arkadyevitch sprinkled some scent on himself, pulled down his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shirt-cuffs, distributed into his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pockets his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cigarettes, pocketbook, matches, and watch with its double chain and seals, and shaking out his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) handkerchief, feeling himself clean, fragrant, healthy, and physically at ease, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) unhappiness, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) walked with a slight swing on each leg into the dining-room, where coffee was already waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and beside the coffee, letters and papers from the office.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) read the letters.
<p/>One was very unpleasant, from a merchant who was buying a forest on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife's property.
<p/>To sell this forest was absolutely essential; but at present, until he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was reconciled with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife, the subject could not be discussed.
<p/>The most unpleasant thing of all was that his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the question of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) reconciliation with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife.
<p/>And the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might be led on by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) interests, that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might seek a reconciliation with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife on account of the sale of the forest--that idea hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) letters, Stepan Arkadyevitch moved the office-papers close to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), rapidly looked through two pieces of business, made a few notes with a big pencil, and pushing away the papers, turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) coffee.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sipped his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) coffee, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) opened a still damp morning paper, and began reading it.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch took in and read a liberal paper, not an extreme one, but one advocating the views held by the majority.
<p/>And in spite of the fact that science, art, and politics had no special interest for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) firmly held those views on all these subjects which were held by the majority and by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) paper, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) only changed them when the majority changed them--or, more strictly speaking, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not change them, but they imperceptibly changed of themselves within him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch had not chosen his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) political opinions or his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) views; these political opinions and views had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) of themselves, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not choose the shapes of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hat and coat, but simply took those that were being worn.
<p/>And for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), living in a certain society--owing to the need, ordinarily developed at years of discretion, for some degree of mental activity--to have views was just as indispensable as to have a hat.
<p/>If there was a reason for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) preferring liberal to conservative views, which were held also by many of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) circle, it arose not from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) considering liberalism more rational, but from its being in closer accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) manner of life.
<p/>The liberal party said that in Russia everything is wrong, and certainly Stepan Arkadyevitch had many debts and was decidedly short of money.
<p/>The liberal party said that marriage is an institution quite out of date, and that it needs reconstruction; and family life certainly afforded Stepan Arkadyevitch little gratification, and forced him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) into lying and hypocrisy, which was so repulsive to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) nature.
<p/>The liberal party said, or rather allowed it to be understood, that religion is only a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the people; and Stepan Arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service without his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) legs aching from standing up, and could never make out what was the object of all the terrible and high-flown language about another world when life might be so very amusing in this world.
<p/>And with all this, Stepan Arkadyevitch, who liked a joke, was fond of puzzling a plain man by saying that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prided himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) origin, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought not to stop at Rurik and disown the first founder of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family--the monkey.
<p/>And so Liberalism had become a habit of Stepan Arkadyevitch's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) newspaper, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cigar after dinner, for the slight fog it diffused in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read the leading article, in which it was maintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative elements, and that the government ought to take measures to crush the revolutionary hydra; that, on the contrary, <div class="bookquote">``in our opinion the danger lies not in that fantastic revolutionary hydra, but in the obstinacy of traditionalism clogging progress,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>etc., etc..
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read another article, too, a financial one, which alluded to Bentham and Mill, and dropped some innuendoes reflecting on the ministry.
<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) characteristic quickwittedness he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caught the drift of each innuendo, divined whence it came, at whom and on what ground it was aimed, and that afforded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as it always did, a certain satisfaction.
<p/>But today that satisfaction was embittered by Matrona Philimonovna's advice and the unsatisfactory state of the household.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read, too, that Count Beist was rumored to have left for Wiesbaden, and that one need have no more gray hair, and of the sale of a light carriage, and of a young person seeking a situation; but these items of information did not give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as usual, a quiet, ironical gratification.
<p/>Having finished the paper, a second cup of coffee and a roll and butter, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up, shaking the crumbs of the roll off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waistcoat; and, squaring his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) broad chest, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiled joyously:  not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind--the joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion.
<p/>But this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grew thoughtful.
<p/>Two childish voices -LRB-Stepan Arkadyevitch recognized the voices of Grisha, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) youngest boy, and Tanya, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eldest girl-RRB- were heard outside the door.
<p/>They were carrying something, and dropped it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you not to sit passengers on the roof,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the little girl in English; <div class="bookquote">``there, pick them up!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything's in confusion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>thought Stepan Arkadyevitch; <div class="bookquote">``there are the children running about by themselves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>And going to the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called them.
<p/>They threw down the box, that represented a train, and came in to their father.
<p/>The little girl, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father's favorite, ran up boldly, embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and hung laughingly on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) neck, enjoying as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) always did the smell of scent that came from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) whiskers.
<p/>At last the little girl kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face, which was flushed from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stooping posture and beaming with tenderness, loosed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands, and was about to run away again; but her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father held her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is mamma?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked, passing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter's smooth, soft little neck.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, smiling to the boy, who had come up to greet him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) loved the boy less, and always tried to be fair; but the boy felt it, and did not respond with a smile to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father's chilly smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is up,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>answered the girl.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That means that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s not slept again all night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, is she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) cheerful?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father and mother, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother could not be cheerful, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father must be aware of this, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was pretending when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked about it so lightly.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) blushed for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at once perceived it, and blushed too.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not say we must do our lessons, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said we were to go for a walk with Miss Hoole to grandmamma's.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, go, Tanya, my darling.
<p/>Oh, wait a minute, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, still holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) and stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) soft little hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took off the mantelpiece, where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had put it yesterday, a little box of sweets, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) two, picking out her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) favorites, a chocolate and a fondant.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For Grisha?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>said the little girl, pointing to the chocolate.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And still stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) little shoulder, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) on the roots of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair and neck, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) go.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The carriage is ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matvey</b></font>)</div>said Matvey; <div class="bookquote">``but there's some one to see you with a petition.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Matvey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Been here long?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Half an hour.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How many times have I told you to tell me at once?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One must let you drink your coffee in peace, at least,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matvey</b></font>)</div>said Matvey, in the affectionately gruff tone with which it was impossible to be angry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, show the person up at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div>said Oblonsky, frowning with vexation.
<p/>The petitioner, the widow of a staff captain Kalinin, came with a request impossible and unreasonable; but Stepan Arkadyevitch, as he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) generally did, made her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) sit down, heard her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) to the end attentively without interrupting her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) detailed advice as to how and to whom to apply, and even wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) large, sprawling, good and legible hand, a confident and fluent little note to a personage who might be of use to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>).
<p/>Having got rid of the staff captain's widow, Stepan Arkadyevitch took his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hat and stopped to recollect whether he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had forgotten anything.
<p/>It appeared that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had forgotten nothing except what he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) wanted to forget--his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) head, and his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) handsome face assumed a harassed expression.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To go, or not to go!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) said to himself; and an inner voice told him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) must not go, that nothing could come of it but falsity; that to amend, to set right their relations was impossible, because it was impossible to make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) attractive again and able to inspire love, or to make him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) an old man, not susceptible to love.
<p/>Except deceit and lying nothing could come of it now; and deceit and lying were opposed to his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) nature.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be some time, though:  it can't go on like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) said, trying to give himself courage.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) squared his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) chest, took out a cigarette, took two whiffs at it, flung it into a mother-of-pearl ashtray, and with rapid steps walked through the drawing room, and opened the other door into his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) wife's bedroom.
<p/>Chapter 4   Darya Alexandrovna, in a dressing jacket, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) now scanty, once luxuriant and beautiful hair fastened up with hairpins on the nape of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) neck, with a sunken, thin face and large, startled eyes, which looked prominent from the thinness of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face, was standing among a litter of all sorts of things scattered all over the room, before an open bureau, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was taking something.
<p/>Hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's steps, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stopped, looking towards the door, and trying assiduously to give her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) features a severe and contemptuous expression.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and afraid of the coming interview.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was just attempting to do what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had attempted to do ten times already in these last three days--to sort out the children's things and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own, so as to take them to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother's--and again she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could not bring herself to do this; but now again, as each time before, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) kept saying to herself, <div class="bookquote">``that things cannot go on like this, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must take some step''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), put him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to shame, avenge on him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) some little part at least of the suffering he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) still continued to tell herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should leave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was conscious that this was impossible; it was impossible because she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could not get out of the habit of regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband and loving him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>Besides this, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) realized that if even here in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own house she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could hardly manage to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) five children properly, they would be still worse off where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was going with them all.
<p/>As it was, even in the course of these three days, the youngest was unwell from being given unwholesome soup, and the others had almost gone without their dinner the day before.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was conscious that it was impossible to go away; but, cheating herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went on all the same sorting out her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) things and pretending she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was going.
<p/>Seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands into the drawer of the bureau as though looking for something, and only looked round at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had come quite up to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tried to give a severe and resolute expression, betrayed bewilderment and suffering.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said in a subdued and timid voice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) head towards his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shoulder and tried to look pitiful and humble, but for all that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was radiant with freshness and health.
<p/>In a rapid glance she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) scanned his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) figure that beamed with health and freshness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is happy and content!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``while I....  And that disgusting good nature, which every one likes him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for and praises--I hate that good nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mouth stiffened, the muscles of the cheek contracted on the right side of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pale, nervous face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said in a rapid, deep, unnatural voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) repeated, with a quiver in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna is coming today.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what is that to me?
<p/>I can't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must, really, Dolly...''   (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go away, go away, go away!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) shrieked, not looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as though this shriek were called up by physical pain.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch could be calm when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would  come round , as Matvey expressed it, and could quietly go on reading his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) paper and drinking his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) coffee; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tortured, suffering face, heard the tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) voice, submissive to fate and full of despair, there was a catch in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) breath and a lump in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) throat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes began to shine with tears.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My God!
<p/>what have I done?
<p/>Dolly!
<p/>For God's sake!....
<p/>You know...''   (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could not go on; there was a sob in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) throat.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shut the bureau with a slam, and glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly, what can I say?....
<p/>One thing: forgive...Remember, cannot nine years of my life atone for an instant...''   (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes and listened, expecting what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would say, as it were beseeching him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in some way or other to make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) believe differently.  ''
<p/>--instant of passion?''
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, and would have gone on, but at that word, as at a pang of physical pain, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lips stiffened again, and again the muscles of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) right cheek worked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away, go out of the room!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shrieked still more shrilly, <div class="bookquote">``and don't talk to me of your passion and your loathsomeness.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tried to go out, but tottered, and clung to the back of a chair to support herself.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face relaxed, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lips swelled, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes were swimming with tears.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, sobbing now; <div class="bookquote">``for mercy's sake, think of the children; they are not to blame!
<p/>I am to blame, and punish me, make me expiate my fault.

<p/>But, Dolly, forgive me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) sat down.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) hard, heavy breathing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was unutterably sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) tried several times to begin to speak, but could not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are loathsome to me, repulsive!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) shrieked, getting more and more heated.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), and the fury expressed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) face alarmed and amazed him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) did not understand how his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) exasperated her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) saw in him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) sympathy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), but not love.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) hates me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is awful!

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said.
<p/>At that moment in the next room a child began to cry; probably it had fallen down.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna listened, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) face suddenly softened.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) seemed to be pulling herself together for a few seconds, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) did not know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was doing, and getting up rapidly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) moved towards the door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) loves my child,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) thought, noticing the change of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) face at the child's cry, <div class="bookquote">``my child: how can she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) hate me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly, one word more,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said, following her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Matvey says she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) will come round; but how?

<p/>It was Friday, and in the dining room the German watchmaker was winding up the clock.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) joke about this punctual, bald watchmaker, <div class="bookquote">``that the German was wound up for a whole lifetime himself, to wind up watches,''  (<font color='red'><b>this watchmaker</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) smiled.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch was fond of a joke: <div class="bookquote">``And maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) will come round!
<p/>That's a good expression, ' come round, '''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must repeat that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Matvey!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) shouted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Arrange everything with Darya in the sitting room for Anna Arkadyevna,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) said to Matvey when he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) came in.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch put on his (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) fur coat and went out onto the steps.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't dine at home?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Matvey</b></font>)</div><p/>said Matvey, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) off.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's as it happens.
<p/>But here's for the housekeeping,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) said, taking ten roubles from his (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) pocketbook.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That'll be enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough or not enough, we must make it do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matvey</b></font>)</div>said Matvey, slamming the carriage door and stepping back onto the steps.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna meanwhile having pacified the child, and knowing from the sound of the carriage that he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) had gone off, went back again to her (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) bedroom.
<p/>It was her (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) solitary refuge from the household cares which crowded upon her (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) directly she (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) went out from it.
<p/>Even now, in the short time she (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) had been in the nursery, the English governess and Matrona Philimonovna had succeeded in putting several questions to her (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>), which did not admit of delay, and which only she (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) could answer: <div class="bookquote">``What were the children to put on for their walk?
<p/>Should they have any milk?
<p/>Should not a new cook be sent for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, let me alone, let me alone!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) said, and going back to her (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) bedroom she (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) sat down in the same place as she (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) had sat when talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) husband, clasping tightly her (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) thin hands with the rings that slipped down on her (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) bony fingers, and fell to going over in her (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) memory all the conversation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has gone!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can it be he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sees her (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>)?

<p/>Even if we remain in the same house, we are strangers--strangers forever!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) repeated again with special significance the word so dreadful to her (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>).

<p/>And now don't I love him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?

<p/>The most horrible thing is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) began, but did not finish her (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) thought, because Matrona Philimonovna put her (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) head in at the door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us send for my brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) can get a dinner anyway, or we shall have the children getting nothing to eat till six again, like yesterday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, I will come directly and see about it.
<p/>But did you send for some new milk?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>And Darya Alexandrovna plunged into the duties of the day, and drowned her (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) grief in them for a time.
<p/>Chapter 5   Stepan Arkadyevitch had learned easily at school, thanks to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) excellent abilities, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had been idle and mischievous, and therefore was one of the lowest in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) class.
<p/>But in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) habitually dissipated mode of life, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) inferior grade in the service, and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) comparative youth, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) occupied the honorable and lucrative position of president of one of the government boards at Moscow.
<p/>This post he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had received through his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister Anna's husband, Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin, who held one of the most important positions in the ministry to whose department the Moscow office belonged.
<p/>But if Karenin had not got his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) brother- in-law this berth, then through a hundred other personages-- brothers, sisters, cousins, uncles, and aunts--Stiva Oblonsky would have received this post, or some other similar one, together with the salary of six thousand absolutely needful for him (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>), as his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) affairs, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) wife's considerable property, were in an embarrassed condition.
<p/>Half Moscow and Petersburg were friends and relations of Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) was born in the midst of those who had been and are the powerful ones of this world.
<p/>One-third of the men in the government, the older men, had been friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) father's, and had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) in petticoats; another third were his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) intimate chums, and the remainder were friendly acquaintances.
<p/>Consequently the distributors of earthly blessings in the shape of places, rents, shares, and such, were all his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) friends, and could not overlook one of their own set; and Oblonsky had no need to make any special exertion to get a lucrative post.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) had only not to refuse things, not to show jealousy, not to be quarrelsome or take offense, all of which from his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) characteristic good nature he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) never did.
<p/>It would have struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) as absurd if he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) had been told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) would not get a position with the salary he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) required, especially as he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) expected nothing out of the way; he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) only wanted what the men of his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) own age and standing did get, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) was no worse qualified for performing duties of the kind than any other man.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch was not merely liked by all who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good humor, but for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bright disposition, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unquestionable honesty.
<p/>In him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handsome, radiant figure, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sparkling eyes, black hair and eyebrows, and the white and red of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, there was something which produced a physical effect of kindliness and good humor on the people who met him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha!
<p/>Stiva!
<p/>Oblonsky!
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>was almost always said with a smile of delight on meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Even though it happened at times that after a conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) it seemed that nothing particularly delightful had happened, the next day, and the next, every one was just as delighted at meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again.
<p/>After filling for three years the post of president of one of the government boards at Moscow, Stepan Arkadyevitch had won the respect, as well as the liking, of his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) fellow-officials, subordinates, and superiors, and all who had had business with him (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>).
<p/>The principal qualities in Stepan Arkadyevitch which had gained him (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) this universal respect in the service consisted, in the first place, of his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) extreme indulgence for others, founded on a consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) own shortcomings; secondly, of his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) perfect liberalism--not the liberalism he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) read of in the papers, but the liberalism that was in his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) blood, in virtue of which he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) treated all men perfectly equally and exactly the same, whatever their fortune or calling might be; and thirdly--the most important point--his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) complete indifference to the business in which he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) was engaged, in consequence of which he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) was never carried away, and never made mistakes.
<p/>On reaching the offices of the board, Stepan Arkadyevitch, escorted by a deferential porter with a portfolio, went into his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) little private room, put on his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) uniform, and went into the boardroom.
<p/>The clerks and copyists all rose, greeting him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) with good-humored deference.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch moved quickly, as ever, to his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) place, shook hands with his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) colleagues, and sat down.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) made a joke or two, and talked just as much as was consistent with due decorum, and began work.
<p/>No one knew better than Stepan Arkadyevitch how to hit on the exact line between freedom, simplicity, and official stiffness necessary for the agreeable conduct of business.
<p/>A secretary, with the good-humored deference common to every one in Stepan Arkadyevitch's office, came up with papers, and began to speak in the familiar and easy tone which had been introduced by Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have succeeded in getting the information from the government department of Penza.
<p/>Here, would you care?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got them at last?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) finger on the paper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, gentlemen...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the sitting of the board began.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If they knew,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) thought, bending his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) head with a significant air as he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) listened to the report, <div class="bookquote">``what a guilty little boy their president was half an hour ago.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes were laughing during the reading of the report.
<p/>Till two o'clock the sitting would go on without a break, and at two o'clock there would be an interval and luncheon.
<p/>It was not yet two, when the large glass doors of the boardroom suddenly opened and someone came in.
<p/>All the officials sitting on the further side under the portrait of the Tsar and the eagle, delighted at any distraction, looked round at the door; but the doorkeeper standing at the door at once drove out the intruder, and closed the glass door after him (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>).
<p/>When the case had been read through, Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and stretched, and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the times took out a cigarette in the boardroom and went into his (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) private room.
<p/>Two of the members of the board, the old veteran in the service, Nikitin, and the  Kammerjunker Grinevitch , went in with him (<font color='blue'><b>veteran</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall have time to finish after lunch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure we shall!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nikitin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Nikitin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A pretty sharp fellow this Fomin must be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grinevitch</b></font>)</div>said Grinevitch of one of the persons taking part in the case they were examining.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch frowned at Grinevitch's words, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thereby to understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) no reply.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was that came in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) asked the doorkeeper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Someone, your excellency, crept in without permission directly my back was turned.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was asking for you.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>): when the members come out, then...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s gone into the passage, but here he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) comes anyway.
<p/>That is he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the doorkeeper</b></font>)</div>said the doorkeeper, pointing to a strongly built, broad-shouldered man with a curly beard, who, without taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sheepskin cap, was running lightly and rapidly up the worn steps of the stone staircase.
<p/>One of the members going down--a lean official with a portfolio--stood out of his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) way and looked disapprovingly at the legs of the stranger, then glanced inquiringly at Oblonsky.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch was standing at the top of the stairs.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) good-naturedly beaming face above the embroidered collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) uniform beamed more than ever when he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) recognized the man coming up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's actually you, Levin, at last!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said with a friendly mocking smile, scanning Levin as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) approached.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is it you have deigned to look me up in this den?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and not content with shaking hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) friend.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been here long?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just come, and very much wanted to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, looking shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily around.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let's go into my room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) friend's sensitive and irritable shyness, and, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) along, as though guiding him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) through dangers.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch was on familiar terms with almost all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) acquaintances, and called almost all of them by their Christian names: old men of sixty, boys of twenty, actors, ministers, merchants, and adjutant-generals, so that many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) intimate chums were to be found at the extreme ends of the social ladder, and would have been very much surprised to learn that they had, through the medium of Oblonsky, something in common.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was the familiar friend of everyone with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took a glass of champagne, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took a glass of champagne with everyone, and when in consequence he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) met any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) disreputable chums, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) used in joke to call many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) friends, in the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) subordinates, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) well knew how, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) characteristic tact, to diminish the disagreeable impression made on them.
<p/>Levin was not a disreputable chum, but Oblonsky, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ready tact, felt that Levin fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) might not care to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) intimacy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) before his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) subordinates, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) made haste to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) off into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) room.
<p/>Levin was almost of the same age as Oblonsky; their intimacy did not rest merely on champagne.
<p/>Levin had been the friend and companion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) early youth.
<p/>They were fond of one another in spite of the difference of their characters and tastes, as friends are fond of one another who have been together in early youth.
<p/>But in spite of this, each of them--as is often the way with men who have selected careers of different kinds--though in discussion he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would even justify the other's career, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart despised it.
<p/>It seemed to each of them that the life he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) led himself was the only real life, and the life led by his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) friend was a mere phantasm.
<p/>Oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the sight of Levin.
<p/>How often he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) come up to Moscow from the country where he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was doing something, but what precisely Stepan Arkadyevitch could never quite make out, and indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took no interest in the matter.
<p/>Levin arrived in Moscow always excited and in a hurry, rather ill at ease and irritated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own want of ease, and for the most part with a perfectly new, unexpected view of things.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed at this, and liked it.
<p/>In the same way Levin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart despised the town mode of life of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) friend, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) official duties, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) laughed at, and regarded as trifling.
<p/>But the difference was that Oblonsky, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was doing the same as every one did, laughed complacently and good-humoredly, while Levin laughed without complacency and sometimes angrily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have long been expecting you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, going into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) room and letting Levin's hand go as though to show that here all danger was over.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very, very glad to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how are you?
<p/>Eh?
<p/>When did you come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin was silent, looking at the unknown faces of Oblonsky's two companions, and especially at the hand of the elegant Grinevitch, which had such long white fingers, such long yellow filbert-shaped nails, and such huge shining studs on the shirt-cuff, that apparently they absorbed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) attention, and allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) no freedom of thought.
<p/>Oblonsky noticed this at once, and smiled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, to be sure, let me introduce you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My colleagues: Philip Ivanitch Nikitin, Mihail Stanislavitch Grinevitch'' (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>--and turning to Levin--<div class="bookquote">``a district councilor, a modern district councilman, a gymnast who lifts thirteen stone with one hand, a cattle-breeder and sportsman, and my friend, Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, the brother of Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Delighted,''  (<font color='red'><b>the veteran</b></font>)</div>said the veteran.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have the honor of knowing your brother, Sergey Ivanovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grinevitch</b></font>)</div>said Grinevitch, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) slender hand with its long nails.
<p/>Levin frowned, shook hands coldly, and at once turned to Oblonsky.
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had a great respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) half-brother, an author well known to all Russia, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not endure it when people treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) not as Konstantin Levin, but as the brother of the celebrated Koznishev.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am no longer a district councilor.
<p/>I have quarreled with them all, and don't go to the meetings any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>councilor</b></font>) said, turning to Oblonsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been quick about it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Oblonsky with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how?
<p/>why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a long story.
<p/>I will tell you some time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) at once.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to put it shortly, I was convinced that nothing was really done by the district councils, or ever could be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began, as though some one had just insulted him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``On one side it's a plaything; they play at being a parliament, and I'm neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings; and on the other side''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stammered-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``it's a means for the coterie of the district to make money.
<p/>Formerly they had wardships, courts of justice, now they have the district council--not in the form of bribes, but in the form of unearned salary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, as hotly as though someone of those present had opposed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) opinion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha!
<p/>You're in a new phase again, I see--a conservative,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``However, we can go into that later.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, later.
<p/>But I wanted to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, looking with hatred at Grinevitch's hand.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch gave a scarcely perceptible smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How was it you used to say you would never wear European dress again?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, scanning his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) new suit, obviously cut by a French tailor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>I see: a new phase.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin suddenly blushed, not as grown men blush, slightly, without being themselves aware of it, but as boys blush, feeling that they are ridiculous through their shyness, and consequently ashamed of it and blushing still more, almost to the point of tears.
<p/>And it was so strange to see this sensible, manly face in such a childish plight, that Oblonsky left off looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, where shall we meet?
<p/>You know I want very much to talk to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/>Oblonsky seemed to ponder.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what: let's go to Gurin's to lunch, and there we can talk.
<p/>I am free till three.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin, after an instant's thought, <div class="bookquote">``I have got to go on somewhere else.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, then, let's dine together.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dine together?
<p/>But I have nothing very particular, only a few words to say, and a question I want to ask you, and we can have a talk afterwards.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, say the few words, then, at once, and we'll gossip after dinner.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin; <div class="bookquote">``but it's of no importance, though.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face all at once took an expression of anger from the effort he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was making to surmount his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shyness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are the Shtcherbatskys doing?
<p/>Everything as it used to be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had long known that Levin was in love with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sister-in-law, Kitty, gave a hardly perceptible smile, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes sparkled merrily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You said a few words, but I can't answer in a few words, because....
<p/>Excuse me a minute...''   (<font color='red'><b>A secretary</b></font>)</div>A secretary came in, with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness, characteristic of every secretary, of superiority to his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) chief in the knowledge of their business; he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) went up to Oblonsky with some papers, and began, under pretense of asking a question, to explain some objection.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch, without hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) out, laid his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) hand genially on the secretary's sleeve.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you do as I told you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) said, softening his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) words with a smile, and with a brief explanation of his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) view of the matter he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) turned away from the papers, and said: <div class="bookquote">``So do it that way, if you please, Zahar Nikititch.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The secretary retired in confusion.
<p/>During the consultation with the secretary Levin had completely recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) embarrassment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) elbows on the back of a chair, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face was a look of ironical attention.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand it, I don't understand it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What don't you understand?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Oblonsky, smiling as brightly as ever, and picking up a cigarette.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) expected some queer outburst from Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand what you are doing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you do it seriously?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, because there's nothing in it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think so, but we're overwhelmed with work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On paper.
<p/>But, there, you've a gift for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>added Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's to say, you think there's a lack of something in me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But all the same I admire your grandeur, and am proud that I've a friend in such a great person.
<p/>You've not answered my question, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) went on, with a desperate effort looking Oblonsky straight in the face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's all very well.
<p/>You wait a bit, and you'll come to this yourself.
<p/>It's very nice for you to have over six thousand acres in the Karazinsky district, and such muscles, and the freshness of a girl of twelve; still you'll be one of us one day.
<p/>Yes, as to your question, there is no change, but it's a pity you've been away so long.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, why so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin queried, panic-stricken.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div>responded Oblonsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll talk it over.
<p/>But what's brought you up to town?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we'll talk about that, too, later on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, reddening again up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ears.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right.
<p/>I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should ask you to come to us, you know, but my wife's not quite the thing.
<p/>But I tell you what; if you want to see them, they're sure now to be at the Zoological Gardens from four to five.
<p/>Kitty skates.
<p/>You drive along there, and I'll come and fetch you, and we'll go and dine somewhere together.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Capital.
<p/>So good-bye till then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now mind, you'll forget, I know you, or rush off home to the country!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch called out laughing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, truly!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>And Levin went out of the room, only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was in the doorway remembering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had forgotten to take leave of Oblonsky's colleagues.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That gentleman must be a man of great energy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grinevitch</b></font>)</div>said Grinevitch, when Levin had gone away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s a lucky fellow!
<p/>Over six thousand acres in the Karazinsky district; everything before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>); and what youth and vigor!
<p/>Not like some of us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a great deal to complain of, haven't you, Stepan Arkadyevitch?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes, I'm in a poor way, a bad way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a heavy sigh.
<p/>Chapter 6   When Oblonsky asked Levin what had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to town, Levin blushed, and was furious with himself for blushing, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not answer, <div class="bookquote">``I have come to make your sister-in-law an offer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>though that was precisely what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had come for.
<p/>The families of the Levins and the Shtcherbatskys were old, noble Moscow families, and had always been on intimate and friendly terms.
<p/>This intimacy had grown still closer during Levin's student days.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had both prepared for the university with the young Prince Shtcherbatsky, the brother of Kitty and Dolly, and had entered at the same time with him (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatsky</b></font>).
<p/>In those days Levin used often to be in the Shtcherbatskys' house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was in love with the Shtcherbatsky household.
<p/>Strange as it may appear, it was with the household, the family, that Konstantin Levin was in love, especially with the feminine half of the household.
<p/>Levin did not remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own mother, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) only sister was older than he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was, so that it was in the Shtcherbatskys' house that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw for the first time that inner life of an old, noble, cultivated, and honorable family of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been deprived by the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) father and mother.
<p/>All the members of that family, especially the feminine half, were pictured by him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), as it were, wrapped about with a mysterious poetical veil, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) not only perceived no defects whatever in them, but under the poetical veil that shrouded them he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) assumed the existence of the loftiest sentiments and every possible perfection.
<p/>Why it was the three young ladies had one day to speak French, and the next English; why it was that at certain hours they played by turns on the piano, the sounds of which were audible in their brother's room above, where the students used to work; why they were visited by those professors of French literature, of music, of drawing, of dancing; why at certain hours all the three young ladies, with Mademoiselle Linon, drove in the coach to the Tversky boulevard, dressed in their satin cloaks, Dolly in a long one, Natalia in a half-long one, and Kitty in one so short that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) shapely legs in tightly-drawn red stockings were visible to all beholders; why it was they had to walk about the Tversky boulevard escorted by a footman with a gold cockade in his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) hat--all this and much more that was done in their mysterious world he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) did not understand, but he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) was sure that everything that was done there was very good, and he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) was in love precisely with the mystery of the proceedings.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) student days he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) had all but been in love with the eldest, Dolly, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was soon married to Oblonsky.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) began being in love with the second.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) felt, as it were, that he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) had to be in love with one of the sisters, only he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) could not quite make out which.
<p/>But Natalia, too, had hardly made her (<font color='blue'><b>Natalia</b></font>) appearance in the world when she (<font color='blue'><b>Natalia</b></font>) married the diplomat Lvov.
<p/>Kitty was still a child when Levin left the university.
<p/>Young Shtcherbatsky went into the navy, was drowned in the Baltic, and Levin's relations with the Shtcherbatskys, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) friendship with Oblonsky, became less intimate.
<p/>But when early in the winter of this year Levin came to Moscow, after a year in the country, and saw the Shtcherbatskys, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) realized which of the three sisters he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was indeed destined to love.
<p/>One would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), a man of good family, rather rich than poor, and thirty-two years old, to make the young Princess Shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriage; in all likelihood he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would at once have been looked upon as a good match.
<p/>But Levin was in love, and so it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that Kitty was so perfect in every respect that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was a creature far above everything earthly; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be conceived that other people and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) herself could regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) as worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>After spending two months in Moscow in a state of enchantment, seeing Kitty almost every day in society, into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went so as to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) abruptly decided that it could not be, and went back to the country.
<p/>Levin's conviction that it could not be was founded on the idea that in the eyes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) family he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was a disadvantageous and worthless match for the charming Kitty, and that Kitty herself could not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) family's eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had no ordinary, definite career and position in society, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) contemporaries by this time, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was thirty-two, were already, one a colonel, and another a professor, another director of a bank and railways, or president of a board like Oblonsky.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) knew very well how he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) must appear to others-RRB- was a country gentleman, occupied in breeding cattle, shooting game, and building barns; in other words, a fellow of no ability, who had not turned out well, and who was doing just what, according to the ideas of the world, is done by people fit for nothing else.
<p/>The mysterious, enchanting Kitty herself could not love such an ugly person as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) conceived himself to be, and, above all, such an ordinary, in no way striking person.
<p/>Moreover, his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) attitude to Kitty in the past--the attitude of a grown-up person to a child, arising from his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) friendship with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) brother--seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) yet another obstacle to love.
<p/>An ugly, good-natured man, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) considered himself, might, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) supposed, be liked as a friend; but to be loved with such a love as that with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved Kitty, one would need to be a handsome and, still more, a distinguished man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not believe it, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) judged by himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not himself have loved any but beautiful, mysterious, and exceptional women.
<p/>But after spending two months alone in the country, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was convinced that this was not one of those passions of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had experience in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) early youth; that this feeling gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not an instant's rest; that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not live without deciding the question, would she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) or would she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) not be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) despair had arisen only from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own imaginings, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no sort of proof that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be rejected.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had now come to Moscow with a firm determination to make an offer, and get married if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were accepted.
<p/>Or...he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not conceive what would become of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were rejected.
<p/>Chapter 7   On arriving in Moscow by a morning train, Levin had put up at the house of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) elder half-brother, Koznishev.
<p/>After changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) clothes he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's study, intending to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) at once about the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) visit, and to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) advice; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother was not alone.
<p/>With him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) there was a well-known professor of philosophy, who had come from Harkov expressly to clear up a difference that had arisen between them on a very important philosophical question.
<p/>The professor was carrying on a hot crusade against materialists.
<p/>Sergey Koznishev had been following this crusade with interest, and after reading the professor's last article, he (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) had written him (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) a letter stating his (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) objections.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) accused the professor of making too great concessions to the materialists.
<p/>And the professor had promptly appeared to argue the matter out.
<p/>The point in discussion was the question then in vogue: Is there a line to be drawn between psychological and physiological phenomena in man?
<p/>and if so, where?
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch met his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother with the smile of chilly friendliness he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) always had for everyone, and introducing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) to the professor, went on with the conversation.
<p/>A little man in spectacles, with a narrow forehead, tore himself from the discussion for an instant to greet Levin, and then went on talking without paying any further attention to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Levin sat down to wait till the professor should go, but he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) soon began to get interested in the subject under discussion.
<p/>Levin had come across the magazine articles about which they were disputing, and had read them, interested in them as a development of the first principles of science, familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) as a natural science student at the university.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had never connected these scientific deductions as to the origin of man as an animal, as to reflex action, biology, and sociology, with those questions as to the meaning of life and death to himself, which had of late been more and more often in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother's argument with the professor, he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) noticed that they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual problems, that at times they almost touched on the latter; but every time they were close upon what seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) the chief point, they promptly beat a hasty retreat, and plunged again into a sea of subtle distinctions, reservations, quotations, allusions, and appeals to authorities, and it was with difficulty that he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) understood what they were talking about.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot admit it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) habitual clearness, precision of expression, and elegance of phrase.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot in any case agree with Keiss that my whole conception of the external world has been derived from perceptions.
<p/>The most fundamental idea, the idea of existence, has not been received by me through sensation; indeed, there is no special sense-organ for the transmission of such an idea.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but they--Wurt, and Knaust, and Pripasov--would answer that your consciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all your sensations, that that consciousness of existence is  the result of your sensations.
<p/>Wurt, indeed, says plainly that, assuming there are no sensations, it follows that there is no idea of existence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I maintain the contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>began Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/>But here it seemed to Levin that just as they were close upon the real point of the matter, they were again retreating, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind to put a question to the professor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``According to that, if my senses are annihilated, if my body is dead, I can have no existence of any sort?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) queried.
<p/>The professor, in annoyance, and, as it were, mental suffering at the interruption, looked round at the strange inquirer, more like a bargeman than a philosopher, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) eyes upon Sergey Ivanovitch, as though to ask: What's one to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>)?
<p/>But Sergey Ivanovitch, who had been talking with far less heat and one-sidedness than the professor, and who had sufficient breadth of mind to answer the professor, and at the same time to comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which the question was put, smiled and said:  <div class="bookquote">``That question we have no right to answer as yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the professor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have not the requisite data,''  (<font color='red'><b>the professor</b></font>)</div>chimed in the professor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) argument.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I would point out the fact that if, as Pripasov directly asserts, perception is based on sensation, then we are bound to distinguish sharply between these two conceptions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin listened no more, and simply waited for the professor to go.
<p/>Chapter 8   When the professor had gone, Sergey Ivanovitch turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Delighted that you've come.
<p/>For some time, is it?
<p/>How's your farming getting on?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) elder brother took little interest in farming, and only put the question in deference to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) only told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) about the sale of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wheat and money matters.
<p/>Levin had meant to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) determination to get married, and to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) advice; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had indeed firmly resolved to do so.
<p/>But after seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) conversation with the professor, hearing afterwards the unconsciously patronizing tone in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) about agricultural matters -LRB-their mother's property had not been divided, and Levin took charge of both their shares-RRB-, Levin felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not for some reason begin to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) intention of marrying.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother would not look at it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would have wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how is your district council doing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Sergey Ivanovitch, who was greatly interested in these local boards and attached great importance to them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I really don't know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!
<p/>Why, surely you're a member of the board?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not a member now; I've resigned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin, <div class="bookquote">``and I no longer attend the meetings.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>commented Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning.
<p/>Levin in self-defense began to describe what took place in the meetings in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) district.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's how it always is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>Sergey Ivanovitch interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We Russians are always like that.
<p/>Perhaps it's our strong point, really, the faculty of seeing our own shortcomings; but we overdo it, we comfort ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our tongues.
<p/>All I say is, give such rights as our local self-government to any other European people--why, the Germans or the English would have worked their way to freedom from them, while we simply turn them into ridicule.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how can it be helped?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin penitently.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was my last effort.
<p/>And I did try with all my soul.
<p/>I can't.
<p/>I'm no good at it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not that you're no good at it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch; <div class="bookquote">``it is that you don't look at it as you should.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin answered dejectedly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>do you know brother Nikolay's turned up again?''
 (<font color='red'><b>This brother brother half-brother</b></font>)</div><p/>This brother Nikolay was the elder brother of Konstantin Levin, and half-brother of Sergey Ivanovitch; a man utterly ruined, who had dissipated the greater part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) fortune, was living in the strangest and lowest company, and had quarreled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brothers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin cried with horror.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Prokofy saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in the street.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here in Moscow?
<p/>Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)?
<p/>Do you know?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) chair, as though on the point of starting off at once.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry I told you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) head at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) younger brother's excitement.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I sent to find out where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) is living, and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) IOU to Trubin, which I paid.
<p/>This is the answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) sent me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>And Sergey Ivanovitch took a note from under a paper-weight and handed it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother.
<p/>Levin read in the queer, familiar handwriting: <div class="bookquote">``I humbly beg you to leave me in peace.
<p/>That's the only favor I ask of my gracious brothers.--Nikolay Levin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the queer</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin read it, and without raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head stood with the note in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands opposite Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/>There was a struggle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) heart between the desire to forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) unhappy brother for the time, and the consciousness that it would be base to do so.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) obviously wants to offend me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>pursued Sergey Ivanovitch; <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) cannot offend me, and I should have wished with all my heart to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), but I know it's impossible to do that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>repeated Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand and appreciate your attitude to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>); but I shall go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you want to, do; but I shouldn't advise it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``As regards myself, I have no fear of your doing so; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) will not make you quarrel with me; but for your own sake, I should say you would do better not to go.
<p/>You can't do him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) any good; still, do as you please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely I can't do any good, but I feel--especially at such a moment--but that's another thing--I feel I could not be at peace.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that I don't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One thing I do understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) added; <div class="bookquote">``it's a lesson in humility.
<p/>I have come to look very differently and more charitably on what is called infamous since brother Nikolay has become what he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) is...you know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) did...''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's awful, awful!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>repeated Levin.
<p/>After obtaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's address from Sergey Ivanovitch's footman, Levin was on the point of setting off at once to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), but on second thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) decided to put off his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) visit till the evening.
<p/>The first thing to do to set his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart at rest was to accomplish what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had come to Moscow for.
<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's Levin went to Oblonsky's office, and on getting news of the Shtcherbatskys from him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drove to the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been told he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) might find Kitty.
<p/>Chapter 9   At four o'clock, conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) throbbing heart, Levin stepped out of a hired sledge at the Zoological Gardens, and turned along the path to the frozen mounds and the skating ground, knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would certainly find her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) there, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had seen the Shtcherbatskys' carriage at the entrance.
<p/>It was a bright, frosty day.
<p/>Rows of carriages, sledges, drivers, and policemen were standing in the approach.
<p/>Crowds of well-dressed people, with hats bright in the sun, swarmed about the entrance and along the well-swept little paths between the little houses adorned with carving in the Russian style.
<p/>The old curly birches of the gardens, all their twigs laden with snow, looked as though freshly decked in sacred vestments.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) walked along the path towards the skating-ground, and kept saying to himself--<div class="bookquote">``You mustn't be excited, you must be calm.
<p/>What's the matter with you?
<p/>What do you want?
<p/>Be quiet, stupid,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) conjured his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart.
<p/>And the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tried to compose himself, the more breathless he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) found himself.
<p/>An acquaintance met him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and called him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) name, but Levin did not even recognize him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went towards the mounds, whence came the clank of the chains of sledges as they slipped down or were dragged up, the rumble of the sliding sledges, and the sounds of merry voices.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) walked on a few steps, and the skating-ground lay open before his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes, and at once, amidst all the skaters, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was there by the rapture and the terror that seized on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the ground.
<p/>There was apparently nothing striking either in her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dress or her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) attitude.
<p/>But for Levin she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was as easy to find in that crowd as a rose among nettles.
<p/>Everything was made bright by her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was the smile that shed light on all round her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it possible I can go over there on the ice, go up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought.
<p/>The place where she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stood seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) a holy shrine, unapproachable, and there was one moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was almost retreating, so overwhelmed was he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with terror.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to make an effort to master himself, and to remind himself that people of all sorts were moving about her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) too might come there to skate.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) walked down, for a long while avoiding looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) as at the sun, but seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), as one does the sun, without looking.
<p/>On that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set, all acquainted with one another, used to meet on the ice.
<p/>There were crack skaters there, showing off their skill, and learners clinging to chairs with timid, awkward movements, boys, and elderly people skating with hygienic motives.
<p/>They seemed to Levin an elect band of blissful beings because they were here, near her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>All the skaters, it seemed, with perfect self-possession, skated towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), skated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), even spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and were happy, quite apart from her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), enjoying the capital ice and the fine weather.
<p/>Nikolay Shtcherbatsky, Kitty's cousin, in a short jacket and tight trousers, was sitting on a garden seat with his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) skates on.
<p/>Seeing Levin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shouted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>):  <div class="bookquote">``Ah, the first skater in Russia!
<p/>Been here long?
<p/>First-rate ice--do put your skates on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't got my skates,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin answered, marveling at this boldness and ease in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) presence, and not for one second losing sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt as though the sun were coming near him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was in a corner, and turning out her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) slender feet in their high boots with obvious timidity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) skated towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>A boy in Russian dress, desperately waving his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arms and bowed down to the ground, overtook her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) skated a little uncertainly; taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hands out of the little muff that hung on a cord, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) held them ready for emergency, and looking towards Levin, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had recognized, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own fears.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had got round the turn, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) gave herself a push off with one foot, and skated straight up to Shtcherbatsky.
<p/>Clutching at his (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatsky</b></font>) arm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) nodded smiling to Levin.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was more splendid than he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had imagined her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could call up a vivid picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to himself, especially the charm of that little fair head, so freely set on the shapely girlish shoulders, and so full of childish brightness and good humor.
<p/>The childishness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) expression, together with the delicate beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) figure, made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) special charm, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fully realized.
<p/>But what always struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) as something unlooked for, was the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes, soft, serene, and truthful, and above all, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) smile, which always transported Levin to an enchanted world, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt himself softened and tender, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) remembered himself in some days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) early childhood.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been here long?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) added, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) picked up the handkerchief that had fallen out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) muff.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I?
<p/>I've not long...yesterday...I mean today...I arrived,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) emotion not at once understanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was meaning to come and see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said; and then, recollecting with what intention he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was trying to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was promptly overcome with confusion and blushed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know you could skate, and skate so well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) earnestly, as though wishing to make out the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) confusion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your praise is worth having.
<p/>The tradition is kept up here that you are the best of skaters,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) little black-gloved hand brushing a grain of hoarfrost off her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) muff.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I used once to skate with passion; I wanted to reach perfection.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do everything with passion, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should so like to see how you skate.
<p/>Put on skates, and let us skate together.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Skate together!
<p/>Can that be possible?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Levin, gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll put them on directly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went off to get skates.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a long while since we've seen you here, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the attendant</b></font>)</div>said the attendant, supporting his (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) foot, and screwing on the heel of the skate.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Except you, there's none of the gentlemen first-rate skaters.
<p/>Will that be all right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>said he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>), tightening the strap.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, yes; make haste, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin, with difficulty restraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``this now is life, this is happiness!
<p/>Together,  she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said;  let us skate together!
<p/>Speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) now?
<p/>But that's just why I'm afraid to speak--because I'm happy now, happy in hope, anyway....  And then?....
<p/>But I must!
<p/>I must!
<p/>I must!
<p/>Away with weakness!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) feet, took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) overcoat, and scurrying over the rough ice round the hut, came out on the smooth ice and skated without effort, as it were, by simple exercise of will, increasing and slackening speed and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) course.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) approached with timidity, but again her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) smile reassured him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand, and they set off side by side, going faster and faster, and the more rapidly they moved the more tightly she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``With you I should soon learn; I somehow feel confidence in you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, but was at once panic-stricken at what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had said, and blushed.
<p/>And indeed, no sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) uttered these words, when all at once, like the sun going behind a cloud, her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face lost all its friendliness, and Levin detected the familiar change in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) expression that denoted the working of thought; a crease showed on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) smooth brow.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there anything troubling you?--though I've no right to ask such a question,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) added hurriedly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, why so?....
<p/>No, I have nothing to trouble me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) responded coldly; and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) added immediately: <div class="bookquote">``You haven't seen Mlle.
<p/>Linon, have you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) likes you so much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's wrong?
<p/>I have offended her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>Lord help me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Levin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) flew towards the old Frenchwoman with the gray ringlets, who was sitting on a bench.
<p/>Smiling and showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) false teeth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) as an old friend.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you see we're growing up,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), glancing towards Kitty, <div class="bookquote">``and growing old.
<p/>Tiny bear  has grown big now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>pursued the Frenchwoman, laughing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) joke about the three young ladies whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had compared to the three bears in the English nursery tale.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember that's what you used to call them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) remembered absolutely nothing, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) had been laughing at the joke for ten years now, and was fond of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, go and skate, go and skate.
<p/>Our Kitty has learned to skate nicely, hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>When Levin darted up to Kitty her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face was no longer stern; her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with the same sincerity and friendliness, but Levin fancied that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) friendliness there was a certain note of deliberate composure.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt depressed.
<p/>After talking a little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) old governess and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) peculiarities, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) life.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely you must be dull in the country in the winter, aren't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not dull, I am very busy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in check by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) composed tone, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would not have the force to break through, just as it had been at the beginning of the winter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to stay in town long?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) answered, not thinking of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was saying.
<p/>The thought that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) were held in check by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) tone of quiet friendliness he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would end by going back again without deciding anything came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) resolved to make a struggle against it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is it you don't know?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.
<p/>It depends upon you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, and was immediately horror-stricken at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own words.
<p/>Whether it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) words, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not want to hear them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) made a sort of stumble, twice struck out, and hurriedly skated away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) skated up to Mlle.
<p/>Linon, said something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and went towards the pavilion where the ladies took off their skates.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My God!
<p/>what have I done!
<p/>Merciful God!
<p/>help me, guide me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, praying inwardly, and at the same time, feeling a need of violent exercise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) skated about describing inner and outer circles.
<p/>At that moment one of the young men, the best of the skaters of the day, came out of the coffee-house in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) skates, with a cigarette in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>Taking a run, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dashed down the steps in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) skates, crashing and bounding up and down.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) flew down, and without even changing the position of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands, skated away over the ice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's a new trick!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) promptly ran up to the top to do this new trick.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't break your neck!
<p/>it needs practice!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay Shtcherbatsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Nikolay Shtcherbatsky shouted after him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Levin went to the steps, took a run from above as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could, and dashed down, preserving his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) balance in this unwonted movement with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands.
<p/>On the last step he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stumbled, but barely touching the ice with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand, with a violent effort recovered himself, and skated off, laughing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How splendid, how nice he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty was thinking at that time, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) came out of the pavilion with Mlle.
<p/>Linon, and looked towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with a smile of quiet affection, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) were a favorite brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And can it be my fault, can I have done anything wrong?
<p/>They talk of flirtation.
<p/>I know it's not he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that I love; but still I am happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s so jolly.
<p/>Only, why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) say that?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mused.
<p/>Catching sight of Kitty going away, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) at the steps, Levin, flushed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) rapid exercise, stood still and pondered a minute.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) skates, and overtook the mother and daughter at the entrance of the gardens.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Delighted to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div>said Princess Shtcherbatskaya.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``On Thursdays we are home, as always.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Today, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall be pleased to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>the princess said stiffly.
<p/>This stiffness hurt Kitty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not resist the desire to smooth over her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother's coldness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) head, and with a smile said:  <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye till this evening.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment Stepan Arkadyevitch, his (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hat cocked on one side, with beaming face and eyes, strode into the garden like a conquering hero.
<p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) approached his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) mother-in-law, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) responded in a mournful and crestfallen tone to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) inquiries about Dolly's health.
<p/>After a little subdued and dejected conversation with his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) mother-in-law, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) threw out his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) chest again, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) arm in Levin's.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, shall we set off?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been thinking about you all this time, and I'm very, very glad you've come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) said, looking him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) in the face with a significant air.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, come along,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin in ecstasy, hearing unceasingly the sound of that voice saying, <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye till this evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>and seeing the smile with which it was said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the England or the Hermitage?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind which.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, then, the England,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, selecting that restaurant because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) owed more there than at the Hermitage, and consequently considered it mean to avoid it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you got a sledge?
<p/>That's first-rate, for I sent my carriage home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The friends</b></font>)</div><p/>The friends hardly spoke all the way.
<p/>Levin was wondering what that change in Kitty's expression had meant, and alternately assuring himself that there was hope, and falling into despair, seeing clearly that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hopes were insane, and yet all the while he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt himself quite another man, utterly unlike what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been before her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) smile and those words, <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye till this evening.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu of the dinner.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You like turbot, don't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to Levin as they were arriving.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>responded Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Turbot?
<p/>Yes, I'm  awfully  fond of turbot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 10   When Levin went into the restaurant with Oblonsky, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not help noticing a certain peculiarity of expression, as it were, a restrained radiance, about the face and whole figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>Oblonsky took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) overcoat, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hat over one ear walked into the dining room, giving directions to the Tatar waiters, who were clustered about him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in evening coats, bearing napkins.
<p/>Bowing to right and left to the people he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) met, and here as everywhere joyously greeting acquaintances, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went up to the sideboard for a preliminary appetizer of fish and vodka, and said to the painted Frenchwoman decked in ribbons, lace, and ringlets, behind the counter, something so amusing that even that Frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter.
<p/>Levin for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) part refrained from taking any vodka simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt such a loathing of that Frenchwoman, all made up, it seemed, of false hair,  poudre de riz,  and  vinaigre de toilette .
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) made haste to move away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>), as from a dirty place.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) whole soul was filled with memories of Kitty, and there was a smile of triumph and happiness shining in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This way, your excellency, please.
<p/>Your excellency won't be disturbed here,''  (<font color='red'><b>a Tatar</b></font>)</div>said a particularly pertinacious, white-headed old Tatar with immense hips and coat-tails gaping widely behind.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Walk in, your excellency,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) said to Levin; by way of showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) respect to Stepan Arkadyevitch, being attentive to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) guest as well.
<p/>Instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze chandelier, though it already had a table cloth on it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pushed up velvet chairs, and came to a standstill before Stepan Arkadyevitch with a napkin and a bill of fare in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands, awaiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) commands.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you prefer it, your excellency, a private room will be free directly; Prince Golistin with a lady.
<p/>Fresh oysters have come in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>oysters.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch became thoughtful.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How if we were to change our program, Levin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) finger on the bill of fare.
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face expressed serious hesitation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are the oysters good?
<p/>Mind now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're Flensburg, your excellency.
<p/>We've no Ostend.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Flensburg will do, but are they fresh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only arrived yesterday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, how if we were to begin with oysters, and so change the whole program?
<p/>Eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all the same to me.
<p/>I should like cabbage soup and porridge better than anything; but of course there's nothing like that here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Porridge √† la Russe,  your honor would like?''
<p/>said the Tatar, bending down to Levin, like a nurse speaking to a child.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, joking apart, whatever you choose is sure to be good.
<p/>I've been skating, and I'm hungry.
<p/>And don't imagine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) added, detecting a look of dissatisfaction on Oblonsky's face, <div class="bookquote">``that I shan't appreciate your choice.
<p/>I am fond of good things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should hope so!
<p/>After all, it's one of the pleasures of life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, my friend, you give us two--or better say three--dozen oysters, clear soup with vegetables...''   (<font color='red'><b>the Tatar</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Printaniere,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tatar</b></font>)</div>prompted the Tatar.
<p/>But Stepan Arkadyevitch apparently did not care to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) the satisfaction of giving the French names of the dishes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``With vegetables in it, you know.
<p/>Then turbot with thick sauce, then...roast beef; and mind it's good.
<p/>Yes, and capons, perhaps, and then sweets.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The Tatar</b></font>)</div><p/>The Tatar, recollecting that it was Stepan Arkadyevitch's way not to call the dishes by the names in the French bill of fare, did not repeat them after him (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>), but could not resist rehearsing the whole menu to himself according to the bill:--'' Soupe printani√®re, turbot, sauce Beaumarchais, poulard √† l'estragon, mac√©doine de fruits ...etc.,'' and then instantly, as though worked by springs, laying down one bound bill of fare, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) took up another, the list of wines, and submitted it to Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall we drink?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What you like, only not too much.
<p/>Champagne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!
<p/>to start with?
<p/>You're right though, I dare say.
<p/>Do you like the white seal?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Tatar</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Cachet blanc, '' prompted the Tatar.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then, give us that brand with the oysters, and then we'll see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.
<p/>And what table wine?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can give us Nuits.
<p/>Oh, no, better the classic Chablis.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.
<p/>And  your  cheese, your excellency?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, Parmesan.
<p/>Or would you like another?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's all the same to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, unable to suppress a smile.
<p/>And the Tatar ran off with flying coat-tails, and in five minutes darted in with a dish of opened oysters on mother-of-pearl shells, and a bottle between his (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) fingers.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch crushed the starchy napkin, tucked it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) waistcoat, and settling his (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) arms comfortably, started on the oysters.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) said, stripping the oysters from the pearly shell with a silver fork, and swallowing them one after another.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) repeated, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) dewy, brilliant eyes from Levin to the Tatar.
<p/>Levin ate the oysters indeed, though white bread and cheese would have pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) better.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was admiring Oblonsky.
<p/>Even the Tatar, uncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate glasses, glanced at Stepan Arkadyevitch, and settled his (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) white cravat with a perceptible smile of satisfaction.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't care much for oysters, do you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, emptying his (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) wine glass, <div class="bookquote">``or you're worried about something.
<p/>Eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) wanted Levin to be in good spirits.
<p/>But it was not that Levin was not in good spirits; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was ill at ease.
<p/>With what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) soul, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt sore and uncomfortable in the restaurant, in the midst of private rooms where men were dining with ladies, in all this fuss and bustle; the surroundings of bronzes, looking glasses, gas, and waiters--all of it was offensive to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was afraid of sullying what his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) soul was brimful of.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I?
<p/>Yes, I am; but besides, all this bothers me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't conceive how queer it all seems to a country person like me, as queer as that gentleman's nails I saw at your place...''   (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I saw how much interested you were in poor Grinevitch's nails,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's too much for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>responded Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do try, now, and put yourself in my place, take the point of view of a country person.
<p/>We in the country try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most convenient for working with.
<p/>So we cut our nails; sometimes we turn up our sleeves.
<p/>And here people purposely let their nails grow as long as they will, and link on small saucers by way of studs, so that they can do nothing with their hands.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled gaily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, that's just a sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) has no need to do coarse work.

<p/>But still it's queer to me, just as at this moment it seems queer to me that we country folks try to get our meals over as soon as we can, so as to be ready for our work, while here are we trying to drag out our meal as long as possible, and with that object eating oysters...''   (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>objected Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But that's just the aim of civilization--to make everything a source of enjoyment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if that's its aim, I'd rather be a savage.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you are a savage.
<p/>All you Levins are savages.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin sighed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother Nikolay, and felt ashamed and sore, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scowled; but Oblonsky began speaking of a subject which at once drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) attention.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I say, are you going tonight to our people, the Shtcherbatskys', I mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes sparkling significantly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pushed away the empty rough shells, and drew the cheese towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shall certainly go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>replied Levin; <div class="bookquote">``though I fancied the princess was not very warm in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) invitation.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense!

<p/>That's her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) manner-- grande dame, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm coming, too, but I have to go to the Countess Bonina's rehearsal.
<p/>Come, isn't it true that you're a savage?
<p/>How do you explain the sudden way in which you vanished from Moscow?

<p/>The only thing I know is that you always do what no one else does.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, slowly and with emotion, <div class="bookquote">``you're right.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not over exactly, but the future is yours, and the present is mine, and the present--well, it's not all that it might be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, things go wrong.
<p/>But I don't want to talk of myself, and besides I can't explain it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, why have you come to Moscow, then?....
<p/>Hi!
<p/>take away!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) called to the Tatar.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You guess?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>responded Levin, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes like deep wells of light fixed on Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess, but I can't be the first to talk about it.
<p/>You can see by that whether I guess right or wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, gazing at Levin with a subtle smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and what have you to say to me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin in a quivering voice, feeling that all the muscles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face were quivering too.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you look at the question?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch slowly emptied his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) glass of Chablis, never taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes off Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, <div class="bookquote">``there's nothing I desire so much as that--nothing!
<p/>It would be the best thing that could be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you're not making a mistake?
<p/>You know what we're speaking of?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, piercing him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think it's possible?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it's possible.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!

<p/>Oh, but if...if refusal's in store for me!...
<p/>Indeed I feel sure...''   (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why should you think that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) excitement.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems so to me sometimes.
<p/>That will be awful for me, and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, anyway there's nothing awful in it for a girl.
<p/>Every girl's proud of an offer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, every girl, but not she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) so well knew that feeling of Levin's, that for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) all the girls in the world were divided into two classes: one class--all the girls in the world except her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and those girls with all sorts of human weaknesses, and very ordinary girls: the other class--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) alone, having no weaknesses of any sort and higher than all humanity.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay, take some sauce,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, holding back Levin's hand as it pushed away the sauce.
<p/>Levin obediently helped himself to sauce, but would not let Stepan Arkadyevitch go on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dinner.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, stop a minute, stop a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must understand that it's a question of life and death for me.
<p/>I have never spoken to any one of this.
<p/>And there's no one I could speak of it to, except you.
<p/>You know we're utterly unlike each other, different tastes and views and everything; but I know you're fond of me and understand me, and that's why I like you awfully.
<p/>But for God's sake, be quite straightforward with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you what I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'll say more: my wife is a wonderful woman...''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed, remembering his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) position with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife, and, after a moment's silence, resumed--<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has a gift of foreseeing things.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sees right through people; but that's not all; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knows what will come to pass, especially in the way of marriages.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) foretold, for instance, that Princess Shahovskaya would marry Brenteln.
<p/>No one would believe it, but it came to pass.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)'s on your side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not only that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) likes you--she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) says that Kitty is certain to be your wife.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>At these words Levin's face suddenly lighted up with a smile, a smile not far from tears of emotion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) says that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always said she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was exquisite, your wife.
<p/>There, that's enough, enough said about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, getting up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) seat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, but do sit down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>But Levin could not sit down.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) walked with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) firm tread twice up and down the little cage of a room, blinked his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyelids that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tears might not fall, and only then sat down to the table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it's not love.
<p/>I've been in love, but it's not that.
<p/>It's not my feeling, but a sort of force outside me has taken possession of me.
<p/>I went away, you see, because I made up my mind that it could never be, you understand, as a happiness that does not come on earth; but I've struggled with myself, I see there's no living without it.
<p/>And it must be settled.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you go away for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, stop a minute!

<p/>Listen.
<p/>You can't imagine what you've done for me by what you said.
<p/>I'm so happy that I've become positively hateful; I've forgotten everything.
<p/>I heard today that my brother Nikolay...you know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>)'s here...I had even forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>).
<p/>It seems to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>)'s happy too.
<p/>It's a sort of madness.
<p/>But one thing's awful....
<p/>Here, you've been married, you know the feeling...it's awful that we--old--with a past... not of love, but of sins...are brought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent; it's loathsome, and that's why one can't help feeling oneself unworthy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, you've not many sins on your conscience.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas!

<p/>The world's made so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The one comfort is like that prayer, which I always liked: `Forgive me not according to my unworthiness, but according to Thy lovingkindness.'
<p/>That's the only way she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can forgive me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 11   Levin emptied his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) glass, and they were silent for a while.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's one other thing I ought to tell you.
<p/>Do you know Vronsky?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't.
<p/>Why do you ask?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give us another bottle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>Stepan Arkadyevitch directed the Tatar, who was filling up their glasses and fidgeting round them just when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) was not wanted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why you ought to know Vronsky is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>)'s one of your rivals.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's Vronsky?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face was suddenly transformed from the look of childlike ecstasy which Oblonsky had just been admiring to an angry and unpleasant expression.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vronsky is one of the sons of Count Kirill Ivanovitch Vronsky, and one of the finest specimens of the gilded youth of Petersburg.

<p/>Fearfully rich, handsome, great connections, an aide-de-camp, and with all that a very nice, good-natured fellow.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s more than simply a good-natured fellow, as I've found out here--he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s a cultivated man, too, and very intelligent; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s a man who'll make his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mark.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin scowled and was dumb.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) turned up here soon after you'd gone, and as I can see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s over head and ears in love with Kitty, and you know that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother...''

<p/>And immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) recollected his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother Nikolay and how hateful he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was to have been able to forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wait a bit, wait a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling and touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand.

 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin dropped back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) chair; his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face was pale.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I would advise you to settle the thing as soon as may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div>pursued Oblonsky, filling up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) glass.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thanks, I can't drink any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, pushing away his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) glass.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be drunk....  Come, tell me how are you getting on?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went on, obviously anxious to change the conversation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One word more: in any case I advise you to settle the question soon.

<p/>Now his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) whole soul was full of remorse that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had begun this conversation with Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>A feeling such as his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was profaned by talk of the rivalry of some Petersburg officer, of the suppositions and the counsels of Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew what was passing in Levin's soul.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll come some day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But women, my boy, they're the pivot everything turns upon.

 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch's eyes sparkled more than usual.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?

<p/>Levin, too, could not help smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but joking apart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>resumed Stepan Arkadyevitch, <div class="bookquote">``you must understand that the woman is a sweet, gentle loving creature, poor and lonely, and has sacrificed everything.

 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin sighed and made no reply.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own affairs, and did not hear Oblonsky.
<p/>And suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends, though they had been dining and drinking together, which should have drawn them closer, yet each was thinking only of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own affairs, and they had nothing to do with one another.
<p/>Oblonsky had more than once experienced this extreme sense of aloofness, instead of intimacy, coming on after dinner, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew what to do in such cases.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bill!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) called, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went into the next room where he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) promptly came across an aide-de-camp of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) acquaintance and dropped into conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) about an actress and her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) protector.
<p/>And at once in the conversation with the aide-de-camp Oblonsky had a sense of relaxation and relief after the conversation with Levin, which always put him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to too great a mental and spiritual strain.
<p/>When the Tatar appeared with a bill for twenty-six roubles and odd kopecks, besides a tip for himself, Levin, who would another time have been horrified, like any one from the country, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) share of fourteen roubles, did not notice it, paid, and set off homewards to dress and go to the Shtcherbatskys' there to decide his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fate.
<p/>Chapter 12   The young Princess Kitty Shtcherbatskaya was eighteen.
<p/>It was the first winter that she (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) had been out in the world.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) success in society had been greater than that of either of her (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) elder sisters, and greater even than her (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) mother had anticipated.
<p/>To say nothing of the young men who danced at the Moscow balls being almost all in love with Kitty, two serious suitors had already this first winter made their appearance: Levin, and immediately after his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) departure, Count Vronsky.
<p/>Levin's appearance at the beginning of the winter, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) frequent visits, and evident love for Kitty, had led to the first serious conversations between Kitty's parents as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) future, and to disputes between them.
<p/>The prince was on Levin's side; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wished for nothing better for Kitty.
<p/>The princess for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) part, going round the question in the manner peculiar to women, maintained that Kitty was too young, that Levin had done nothing to prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had serious intentions, that Kitty felt no great attraction to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and other side issues; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not state the principal point, which was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) looked for a better match for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) daughter, and that Levin was not to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) liking, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>When Levin had abruptly departed, the princess was delighted, and said to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) husband triumphantly: <div class="bookquote">``You see I was right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>When Vronsky appeared on the scene, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was still more delighted, confirmed in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) opinion that Kitty was to make not simply a good, but a brilliant match.
<p/>In the mother's eyes there could be no comparison between Vronsky and Levin.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) disliked in Levin his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) strange and uncompromising opinions and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shyness in society, founded, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) supposed, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pride and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) queer sort of life, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) considered it, absorbed in cattle and peasants.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not very much like it that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), who was in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) daughter, had kept coming to the house for six weeks, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) were waiting for something, inspecting, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) were afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) might be doing them too great an honor by making an offer, and did not realize that a man, who continually visits at a house where there is a young unmarried girl, is bound to make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intentions clear.
<p/>And suddenly, without doing so, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disappeared.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's as well he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s not attractive enough for Kitty to have fallen in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>thought the mother.
<p/>Vronsky satisfied all the mother's desires.
<p/>Very wealthy, clever, of aristocratic family, on the highroad to a brilliant career in the army and at court, and a fascinating man.
<p/>Nothing better could be wished for.
<p/>Vronsky openly flirted with Kitty at balls, danced with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and came continually to the house, consequently there could be no doubt of the seriousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intentions.
<p/>But, in spite of that, the mother had spent the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and agitation.
<p/>Princess Shtcherbatskaya had herself been married thirty years ago, her (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) aunt arranging the match.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) husband, about whom everything was well known before hand, had come, looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) future bride, and been looked at.
<p/>The match-making aunt had ascertained and communicated their mutual impression.
<p/>That impression had been favorable.
<p/>Afterwards, on a day fixed beforehand, the expected offer was made to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) parents, and accepted.
<p/>All had passed very simply and easily.
<p/>So it seemed, at least, to the princess.
<p/>But over her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) own daughters she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had felt how far from simple and easy is the business, apparently so commonplace, of marrying off one's daughters.
<p/>The panics that had been lived through, the thoughts that had been brooded over, the money that had been wasted, and the disputes with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) husband over marrying the two elder girls, Darya and Natalia!
<p/>Now, since the youngest had come out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Natalia</b></font>) was going through the same terrors, the same doubts, and still more violent quarrels with her (<font color='blue'><b>Natalia</b></font>) husband than she (<font color='blue'><b>Natalia</b></font>) had over the elder girls.
<p/>The old prince, like all fathers indeed, was exceedingly punctilious on the score of the honor and reputation of his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) daughters.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) was irrationally jealous over his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) daughters, especially over Kitty, who was his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) favorite.
<p/>At every turn he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had scenes with the princess for compromising her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) daughter.
<p/>The princess had grown accustomed to this already with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) other daughters, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) felt that there was more ground for the prince's touchiness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) saw that of late years much was changed in the manners of society, that a mother's duties had become still more difficult.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw that girls of Kitty's age formed some sort of clubs, went to some sort of lectures, mixed freely in men's society; drove about the streets alone, many of them did not curtsey, and, what was the most important thing, all the girls were firmly convinced that to choose their husbands was their own affair, and not their parents'.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marriages aren't made nowadays as they used to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>these girls</b></font>)</div>was thought and said by all these young girls, and even by their elders.
<p/>But how marriages were made now, the princess could not learn from any one.
<p/>The French fashion--of the parents arranging their children's future--was not accepted; it was condemned.
<p/>The English fashion of the complete independence of girls was also not accepted, and not possible in Russian society.
<p/>The Russian fashion of match-making by the offices of intermediate persons was for some reason considered unseemly; it was ridiculed by every one, and by the princess herself.
<p/>But how girls were to be married, and how parents were to marry them, no one knew.
<p/>Everyone with whom the princess had chanced to discuss the matter said the same thing: <div class="bookquote">``Mercy on us, it's high time in our day to cast off all that old-fashioned business.
<p/>It's the young people have to marry; and not their parents; and so we ought to leave the young people to arrange it as they choose.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>It was very easy for anyone to say that who had no daughters, but the princess realized that in the process of getting to know each other, her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) daughter might fall in love, and fall in love with someone who did not care to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) or who was quite unfit to be her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) husband.
<p/>And, however much it was instilled into the princess that in our times young people ought to arrange their lives for themselves, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was unable to believe it, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) would have been unable to believe that, at any time whatever, the most suitable playthings for children five years old ought to be loaded pistols.
<p/>And so the princess was more uneasy over Kitty than she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had been over her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) elder sisters.
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was afraid that Vronsky might confine himself to simply flirting with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) daughter.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) daughter was in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), but tried to comfort herself with the thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was an honorable man, and would not do this.
<p/>But at the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) knew how easy it is, with the freedom of manners of today, to turn a girl's head, and how lightly men generally regard such a crime.
<p/>The week before, Kitty had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother of a conversation she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had with Vronsky during a mazurka.
<p/>This conversation had partly reassured the princess; but perfectly at ease she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) could not be.
<p/>Vronsky had told Kitty that both he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) brother were so used to obeying their mother that they never made up their minds to any important undertaking without consulting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And just now, I am impatiently awaiting my mother's arrival from Petersburg, as peculiarly fortunate,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>Kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the words.
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother saw them in a different light.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knew that the old lady was expected from day to day, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would be pleased at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son's choice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt it strange that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) should not make his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) offer through fear of vexing his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother.
<p/>However, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was so anxious for the marriage itself, and still more for relief from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fears, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) believed it was so.
<p/>Bitter as it was for the princess to see the unhappiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) eldest daughter, Dolly, on the point of leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) husband, her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) anxiety over the decision of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) youngest daughter's fate engrossed all her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) feelings.
<p/>Today, with Levin's reappearance, a fresh source of anxiety arose.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was afraid that her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) daughter, who had at one time, as she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) fancied, a feeling for Levin, might, from extreme sense of honor, refuse Vronsky, and that Levin's arrival might generally complicate and delay the affair so near being concluded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) been here long?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>the princess asked about Levin, as they returned home.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) came today, mamma.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's one thing I want to say...''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>began the princess, and from her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) serious and alert face, Kitty guessed what it would be.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, flushing hotly and turning quickly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``please, please don't say anything about that.
<p/>I know, I know all about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wished for what her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother wished for, but the motives of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother's wishes wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only want to say that to raise hopes...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, darling, for goodness' sake, don't talk about it.
<p/>It's so horrible to talk about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother, seeing the tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter's eyes; <div class="bookquote">``but one thing, my love; you promised me you would have no secrets from me.
<p/>You won't?''
 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, mamma, none,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>answered Kitty, flushing a little, and looking her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother straight in the face, <div class="bookquote">``but there's no use in my telling you anything, and I...I...if I wanted to, I don't know what to say or how...I don't know...''   (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not tell an untruth with those eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>thought the mother, smiling at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) agitation and happiness.
<p/>The princess smiled that what was taking place just now in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) soul seemed to the poor child so immense and so important.
<p/>Chapter 13   After dinner, and till the beginning of the evening, Kitty was feeling a sensation akin to the sensation of a young man before a battle.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) heart throbbed violently, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) thoughts would not rest on anything.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt that this evening, when they would both meet for the first time, would be a turning point in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) life.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was continually picturing them to herself, at one moment each separately, and then both together.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mused on the past, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) dwelt with pleasure, with tenderness, on the memories of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) relations with Levin.
<p/>The memories of childhood and of Levin's friendship with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) dead brother gave a special poetic charm to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) relations with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt certain, was flattering and delightful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>); and it was pleasant for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to think of Levin.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) memories of Vronsky there always entered a certain element of awkwardness, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was in the highest degree well-bred and at ease, as though there were some false note--not in Vronsky, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was very simple and nice, but in herself, while with Levin she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt perfectly simple and clear.
<p/>But, on the other hand, directly she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) thought of the future with Vronsky, there arose before her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) a perspective of brilliant happiness; with Levin the future seemed misty.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) went upstairs to dress, and looked into the looking-glass, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) noticed with joy that it was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) good days, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was in complete possession of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) forces,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) needed this so for what lay before her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was conscious of external composure and free grace in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) movements.
<p/>At half-past seven she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had only just gone down into the drawing room, when the footman announced, <div class="bookquote">``Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the footman</b></font>)</div><p/>The princess was still in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) room, and the prince had not come in.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it is to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>thought Kitty, and all the blood seemed to rush to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) heart.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was horrified at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) paleness, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) glanced into the looking-glass.
<p/>At that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knew beyond doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had come early on purpose to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) alone and to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) an offer.
<p/>And only then for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new, different aspect; only then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) realized that the question did not affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) only-- with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) would be happy, and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) loved--but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) would have that moment to wound a man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) liked.
<p/>And to wound him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cruelly.
<p/>What for?
<p/>Because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), dear fellow, loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), was in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>But there was no help for it, so it must be, so it would have to be.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My God!
<p/>shall I myself really have to say it to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) I don't love him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?
<p/>That will be a lie.
<p/>What am I to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?
<p/>That I love someone else?
<p/>No, that's impossible.
<p/>I'm going away, I'm going away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had reached the door, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) step.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!
<p/>it's not honest.
<p/>What have I to be afraid of?
<p/>I have done nothing wrong.
<p/>What is to be, will be!
<p/>I'll tell the truth.
<p/>And with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) one can't be ill at ease.
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said to herself, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) powerful, shy figure, with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shining eyes fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) looked straight into his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face, as though imploring him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not time yet; I think I'm too early,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said glancing round the empty drawing room.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) expectations were realized, that there was nothing to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) from speaking, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face became gloomy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, and sat down at the table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But this was just what I wanted, to find you alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) began, not sitting down, and not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), so as not to lose courage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma will be down directly.

<p/>Yesterday...''   (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) talked on, not knowing what her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) lips were uttering, and not taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) supplicating and caressing eyes off him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) blushed, and ceased speaking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you I did not know whether I should be here long...that it depended on you...''   (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) head lower and lower, not knowing herself what answer she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) should make to what was coming.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That it depended on you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) repeated.

She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was breathing heavily, not looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was feeling ecstasy.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) soul was flooded with happiness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had never anticipated that the utterance of love would produce such a powerful effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>But it lasted only an instant.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) remembered Vronsky.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) clear, truthful eyes, and seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) desperate face, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answered hastily:  <div class="bookquote">``That cannot be...forgive me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A moment ago, and how close she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), of what importance in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) life!
<p/>And how aloof and remote from him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had become now!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was bound to be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bowed, and was meaning to retreat.
<p/>Chapter 14  But at that very moment the princess came in.
<p/>There was a look of horror on her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) face when she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) saw them alone, and their disturbed faces.
<p/>Levin bowed to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), and said nothing.
<p/>Kitty did not speak nor lift her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) has refused him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother face</b></font>)</div>thought the mother, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face lighted up with the habitual smile with which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) guests on Thursdays.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sat down and began questioning Levin about his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) life in the country.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sat down again, waiting for other visitors to arrive, in order to retreat unnoticed.
<p/>Five minutes later there came in a friend of Kitty's, married the preceding winter, Countess Nordston.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nordston</b></font>) was a thin, sallow, sickly, and nervous woman, with brilliant black eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nordston</b></font>) was fond of Kitty, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) showed itself, as the affection of married women for girls always does, in the desire to make a match for Kitty after her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own ideal of married happiness; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to marry Vronsky.
<p/>Levin she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had often met at the Shtcherbatskys' early in the winter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had always disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) invariable and favorite pursuit, when they met, consisted in making fun of him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do like it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looks down at me from the height of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) grandeur, or breaks off his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) learned conversation with me because I'm a fool, or is condescending to me.
<p/>I like that so; to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) condescending!
<p/>I am so glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) can't bear me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) used to say of him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was right, for Levin actually could not bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and despised her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic--her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) nervousness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) delicate contempt and indifference for everything coarse and earthly.
<p/>The Countess Nordston and Levin got into that relation with one another not seldom seen in society, when two persons, who remain externally on friendly terms, despise each other to such a degree that they cannot even take each other seriously, and cannot even be offended by each other.
<p/>The Countess Nordston pounced upon Levin at once.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Konstantin Dmitrievitch!
<p/>So you've come back to our corrupt Babylon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) said, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) tiny, yellow hand, and recalling what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) had chanced to say early in the winter, that Moscow was a Babylon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, is Babylon reformed, or have you degenerated?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) added, glancing with a simper at Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very flattering for me, countess, that you remember my words so well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>responded Levin, who had succeeded in recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) composure, and at once from habit dropped into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tone of joking hostility to the Countess Nordston.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They must certainly make a great impression on you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I should think so!
<p/>I always note them all down.
<p/>Well, Kitty, have you been skating again?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) began talking to Kitty.
<p/>Awkward as it was for Levin to withdraw now, it would still have been easier for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to perpetrate this awkwardness than to remain all the evening and see Kitty, who glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) now and then and avoided his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was on the point of getting up, when the princess, noticing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was silent, addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you be long in Moscow?
<p/>You're busy with the district council, though, aren't you, and can't be away for long?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, princess, I'm no longer a member of the council,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come up for a few days.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's something the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess Nordston</b></font>)</div>thought Countess Nordston, glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) stern, serious face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) isn't in his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) old argumentative mood.
<p/>But I'll draw him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) out.
<p/>I do love making a fool of him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) before Kitty, and I'll do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Konstantin Dmitrievitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``do explain to me, please, what's the meaning of it.
<p/>You know all about such things.
<p/>At home in our village of Kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up all they possessed, and now they can't pay us any rent.
<p/>What's the meaning of that?
<p/>You always praise the peasants so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>At that instant another lady came into the room, and Levin got up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, countess, but I really know nothing about it, and can't tell you anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, and looked round at the officer who came in behind the lady.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That must be Vronsky,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>thought Levin, and, to be sure of it, glanced at Kitty.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had already had time to look at Vronsky, and looked round at Levin.
<p/>And simply from the look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes, that grew unconsciously brighter, Levin knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) loved that man, knew it as surely as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) so in words.
<p/>But what sort of a man was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?
<p/>Now, whether for good or for ill, Levin could not choose but remain; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must find out what the man was like whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) loved.
<p/>There are people who, on meeting a successful rival, no matter in what, are at once disposed to turn their backs on everything good in him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and to see only what is bad.
<p/>There are people, on the other hand, who desire above all to find in that lucky rival the qualities by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) has outstripped them, and seek with a throbbing ache at heart only what is good.
<p/>Levin belonged to the second class.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had no difficulty in finding what was good and attractive in Vronsky.
<p/>It was apparent at the first glance.
<p/>Vronsky was a squarely built, dark man, not very tall, with a good-humored, handsome, and exceedingly calm and resolute face.
<p/>Everything about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face and figure, from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) short-cropped black hair and freshly shaven chin down to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loosely fitting, brand-new uniform, was simple and at the same time elegant.
<p/>Making way for the lady who had come in, Vronsky went up to the princess and then to Kitty.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beautiful eyes shone with a specially tender light, and with a faint, happy, and modestly triumphant smile -LRB-so it seemed to Levin-RRB-, bowing carefully and respectfully over her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) small broad hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>Greeting and saying a few words to everyone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sat down without once glancing at Levin, who had never taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes off him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me introduce you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess, indicating Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, Count Alexey Kirillovitch Vronsky.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky got up and, looking cordially at Levin, shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe I was to have dined with you this winter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, smiling his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) simple and open smile; <div class="bookquote">``but you had unexpectedly left for the country.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Konstantin Dmitrievitch despises and hates town and us townspeople,''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess Nordston</b></font>)</div>said Countess Nordston.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My words must make a deep impression on you, since you remember them so well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, and, suddenly conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had said just the same thing before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) reddened.
<p/>Vronsky looked at Levin and Countess Nordston, and smiled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you always in the country?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) inquired.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it must be dull in the winter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not dull if one has work to do; besides, one's not dull by oneself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin replied abruptly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am fond of the country,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, noticing, and affecting not to notice, Levin's tone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I hope, count, you would not consent to live in the country always,''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess Nordston</b></font>)</div>said Countess Nordston.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know; I have never tried for long.
<p/>I experienced a queer feeling once,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never longed so for the country, Russian country, with bast shoes and peasants, as when I was spending a winter with my mother in Nice.
<p/>Nice itself is dull enough, you know.
<p/>And indeed, Naples and Sorrento are only pleasant for a short time.
<p/>And it's just there that Russia comes back to me most vividly, and especially the country.
<p/>It's as though...''   (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) talked on, addressing both Kitty and Levin, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) serene, friendly eyes from one to the other, and saying obviously just what came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head.
<p/>Noticing that Countess Nordston wanted to say something, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stopped short without finishing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had begun, and listened attentively to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nordston</b></font>).
<p/>The conversation did not flag for an instant, so that the princess, who always kept in reserve, in case a subject should be lacking, two heavy guns--the relative advantages of classical and of modern education, and universal military service--had not to move out either of them, while Countess Nordston had not a chance of chaffing Levin.
<p/>Levin wanted to, and could not, take part in the general conversation; saying to himself every instant, <div class="bookquote">``Now go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) still did not go, as though waiting for something.
<p/>The conversation fell upon table-turning and spirits, and Countess Nordston, who believed in spiritualism, began to describe the marvels she (<font color='blue'><b>Nordston</b></font>) had seen.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, countess, you really must take me, for pity's sake do take me to see them!
<p/>I have never seen anything extraordinary, though I am always on the lookout for it everywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, next Saturday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div>answered Countess Nordston.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, do you believe in it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) asked Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you ask me?
<p/>You know what I shall say.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I want to hear your opinion.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin, <div class="bookquote">``is only that this table-turning simply proves that educated society--so called--is no higher than the peasants.
<p/>They believe in the evil eye, and in witchcraft and omens, while we...''   (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, then you don't believe in it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't believe in it, countess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I've seen it myself?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The peasant women too tell us they have seen goblins.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you think I tell a lie?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) laughed a mirthless laugh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, Masha, Konstantin Dmitrievitch said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) could not believe in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, blushing for Levin, and Levin saw this, and, still more exasperated, would have answered, but Vronsky with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) bright frank smile rushed to the support of the conversation, which was threatening to become disagreeable.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not admit the conceivability at all?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) queried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why not?
<p/>We admit the existence of electricity, of which we know nothing.
<p/>Why should there not be some new force, still unknown to us, which...''   (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When electricity was discovered,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin interrupted hurriedly, <div class="bookquote">``it was only the phenomenon that was discovered, and it was unknown from what it proceeded and what were its effects, and ages passed before its applications were conceived.
<p/>But the spiritualists have begun with tables writing for them, and spirits appearing to them, and have only later started saying that it is an unknown force.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky listened attentively to Levin, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) always did listen, obviously interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but the spiritualists say we don't know at present what this force is, but there is a force, and these are the conditions in which it acts.
<p/>Let the scientific men find out what the force consists in.
<p/>No, I don't see why there should not be a new force, if it...''   (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, because with electricity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin interrupted again, <div class="bookquote">``every time you rub tar against wool, a recognized phenomenon is manifested, but in this case it does not happen every time, and so it follows it is not a natural phenomenon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious for a drawing room, Vronsky made no rejoinder, but by way of trying to change the conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) smiled brightly, and turned to the ladies.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do let us try at once, countess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said; but Levin would finish saying what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``that this attempt of the spiritualists to explain their marvels as some sort of new natural force is most futile.
<p/>They boldly talk of spiritual force, and then try to subject it to material experiment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Every one was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to finish, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I think you would be a first-rate medium,''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess Nordston</b></font>)</div>said Countess Nordston; <div class="bookquote">``there's something enthusiastic in you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Countess Nordston</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mouth, was about to say something, reddened, and said nothing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do let us try table-turning at once, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Princess, will you allow it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>And Vronsky stood up, looking for a little table.
<p/>Kitty got up to fetch a table, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) passed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes met Levin's.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) whole heart, the more because she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was pitying him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) for suffering of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was herself the cause.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you can forgive me, forgive me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``I am so happy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate them all, and you, and myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes responded, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hat.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not destined to escape.
<p/>Just as they were arranging themselves round the table, and Levin was on the point of retiring, the old prince came in, and after greeting the ladies, addressed Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began joyously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Been here long, my boy?
<p/>I didn't even know you were in town.
<p/>Very glad to see you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The prince</b></font>)</div><p/>The old prince embraced Levin, and talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not observe Vronsky, who had risen, and was serenely waiting till the prince should turn to him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>).
<p/>Kitty felt how distasteful her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father's warmth was to Levin after what had happened.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) saw, too, how coldly her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father responded at last to Vronsky's bow, and how Vronsky looked with amiable perplexity at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father, as though trying and failing to understand how and why anyone could be hostilely disposed towards him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) flushed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Prince, let us have Konstantin Dmitrievitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess Nordston</b></font>)</div>said Countess Nordston; <div class="bookquote">``we want to try an experiment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Countess Nordston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What experiment?
<p/>Table-turning?
<p/>Well, you must excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div>said the old prince, looking at Vronsky, and guessing that it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) suggestion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's some sense in that, anyway.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) resolute eyes, and, with a faint smile, began immediately talking to Countess Nordston of the great ball that was to come off next week.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will be there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) said to Kitty.
<p/>As soon as the old prince turned away from him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>), Levin went out unnoticed, and the last impression he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) carried away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) of that evening was the smiling, happy face of Kitty answering Vronsky's inquiry about the ball.
<p/>Chapter 15   At the end of the evening Kitty told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) conversation with Levin, and in spite of all the pity she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt for Levin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was glad at the thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had received an offer .
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had no doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had acted rightly.
<p/>But after she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had gone to bed, for a long while she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not sleep.
<p/>One impression pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) relentlessly.
<p/>It was Levin's face, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scowling brows, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) kind eyes looking out in dark dejection below them, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stood listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father, and glancing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) and at Vronsky.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt so sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that tears came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>But immediately she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) thought of the man for whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) vividly recalled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manly, resolute face, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) noble self-possession, and the good nature conspicuous in everything towards everyone.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) remembered the love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) of the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) loved, and once more all was gladness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) soul, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) lay on the pillow, smiling with happiness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, I'm sorry; but what could I do?
<p/>It's not my fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said to herself; but an inner voice told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) something else.
<p/>Whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt remorse at having won Levin's love, or at having refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not know.
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) happiness was poisoned by doubts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, have pity on us; Lord, have pity on us; Lord, have pity on us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) repeated to herself, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) fell asleep.
<p/>Meanwhile there took place below, in the prince's little library, one of the scenes so often repeated between the parents on account of their favorite daughter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?
<p/>I'll tell you what!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>shouted the prince, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) arms, and at once wrapping his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) squirrel-lined dressing-gown round him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That you've no pride, no dignity; that you're disgracing, ruining your daughter by this vulgar, stupid match-making!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, really, for mercy's sake, prince, what have I done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>said the princess, almost crying.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), pleased and happy after her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) daughter, had gone to the prince to say good-night as usual, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had no intention of telling him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) of Levin's offer and Kitty's refusal, still she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hinted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) fancied things were practically settled with Vronsky, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would declare himself so soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother arrived.
<p/>And thereupon, at those words, the prince had all at once flown into a passion, and began to use unseemly language.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you done?
<p/>I'll tell you what.
<p/>First of all, you're trying to catch an eligible gentleman, and all Moscow will be talking of it, and with good reason.
<p/>If you have evening parties, invite everyone, don't pick out the possible suitors.
<p/>Invite all the young bucks.
<p/>Engage a piano player, and let them dance, and not as you do things nowadays, hunting up good matches.
<p/>It makes me sick, sick to see it, and you've gone on till you've turned the poor wench's head.
<p/>Levin's a thousand times the better man.
<p/>As for this little Petersburg swell, they're turned out by machinery, all on one pattern, and all precious rubbish.
<p/>But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) were a prince of the blood, my daughter need not run after anyone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what have I done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you've...''  (<font color='red'><b>The prince</b></font>)</div>The prince was crying wrathfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know if one were to listen to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>interrupted the princess, <div class="bookquote">``we should never marry our daughter.
<p/>If it's to be so, we'd better go into the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But do wait a minute.

 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>And the prince, imagining that he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) was mimicking his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) wife, made a mincing curtsey at each word.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, when once you get an idea into your head!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you'll remember my words, but too late, just as with Dolly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, we won't talk of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>the princess stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), recollecting her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) unlucky Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``By all means, and good night!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the husband wife</b></font>)</div><p/>And signing each other with the cross, the husband and wife parted with a kiss, feeling that they each remained of their own opinion.
<p/>The princess had at first been quite certain that that evening had settled Kitty's future, and that there could be no doubt of Vronsky's intentions, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband's words had disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>And returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own room, in terror before the unknown future, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), too, like Kitty, repeated several times in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) heart, <div class="bookquote">``Lord, have pity; Lord, have pity; Lord, have pity.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 16   Vronsky had never had a real home life.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) mother had been in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) youth a brilliant society woman, who had had during her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) married life, and still more afterwards, many love affairs notorious in the whole fashionable world.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) father he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) scarcely remembered, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had been educated in the Corps of Pages.
<p/>Leaving the school very young as a brilliant officer, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had at once got into the circle of wealthy Petersburg army men.
<p/>Although he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) did go more or less into Petersburg society, his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) love affairs had always hitherto been outside it.
<p/>In Moscow he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had for the first time felt, after his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) luxurious and coarse life at Petersburg, all the charm of intimacy with a sweet and innocent girl of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) own rank, who cared for him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>).
<p/>It never even entered his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) head that there could be any harm in his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) relations with Kitty.
<p/>At balls he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) danced principally with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was a constant visitor at their house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) as people commonly do talk in society--all sorts of nonsense, but nonsense to which he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) could not help attaching a special meaning in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) case.
<p/>Although he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) said nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) could not have said before everybody, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was becoming more and more dependent upon him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), and the more he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) felt this, the better he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) liked it, and the tenderer was his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) feeling for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) did not know that his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) mode of behavior in relation to Kitty had a definite character, that it is courting young girls with no intention of marriage, and that such courting is one of the evil actions common among brilliant young men such as he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was.
<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was the first who had discovered this pleasure, and he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) discovery.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) could have heard what her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) parents were saying that evening, if he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) could have put himself at the point of view of the family and have heard that Kitty would be unhappy if he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) did not marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) would have been greatly astonished, and would not have believed it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) could not believe that what gave such great and delicate pleasure to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), and above all to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), could be wrong.
<p/>Still less could he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) have believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) ought to marry.
<p/>Marriage had never presented itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) as a possibility.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) not only disliked family life, but a family, and especially a husband was, in accordance with the views general in the bachelor world in which he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) lived, conceived as something alien, repellant, and, above all, ridiculous.
<p/>But though Vronsky had not the least suspicion what the parents were saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) felt on coming away from the Shtcherbatskys' that the secret spiritual bond which existed between him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) and Kitty had grown so much stronger that evening that some step must be taken.
<p/>But what step could and ought to be taken he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) could not imagine.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is so exquisite,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) returned from the Shtcherbatskys', carrying away with him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) always did, a delicious feeling of purity and freshness, arising partly from the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) had not been smoking for a whole evening, and with it a new feeling of tenderness at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) love for him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>)--``what is so exquisite is that not a word has been said by me or by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), but we understand each other so well in this unseen language of looks and tones, that this evening more clearly than ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) loves me.
<p/>And how secretly, simply, and most of all, how trustfully!
<p/>I feel myself better, purer.
<p/>I feel that I have a heart, and that there is a great deal of good in me.
<p/>Those sweet, loving eyes!
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said:  Indeed I do...'  <div class="bookquote">``Well, what then?
<p/>Oh, nothing.
<p/>It's good for me, and good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) began wondering where to finish the evening.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) passed in review of the places he (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) might go to.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Club?
<p/>a game of bezique, champagne with Ignatov?
<p/>No, I'm not going.
<p/>Ch√¢teau des Fleurs ; there I shall find Oblonsky, songs, the cancan.
<p/>No, I'm sick of it.
<p/>That's why I like the Shtcherbatskys', that I'm growing better.
<p/>I'll go home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) went straight to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) room at Dussot's Hotel, ordered supper, and then undressed, and as soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) head touched the pillow, fell into a sound sleep.
<p/>Chapter 17   Next day at eleven o'clock in the morning Vronsky drove to the station of the Petersburg railway to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother, and the first person he (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) came across on the great flight of steps was Oblonsky, who was expecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sister by the same train.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>your excellency!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Oblonsky, <div class="bookquote">``whom are you meeting?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>Vronsky responded, smiling, as everyone did who met Oblonsky.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and together they ascended the steps.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is to be here from Petersburg today.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was looking out for you till two o'clock last night.
<p/>Where did you go after the Shtcherbatskys'?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Home Vronsky</b></font>)</div>answered Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must own I felt so well content yesterday after the Shtcherbatskys' that I didn't care to go anywhere.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know a gallant steed by tokens sure, And by his (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes I know a youth in love,''   (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>declaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had done before to Levin.
<p/>Vronsky smiled with a look that seemed to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not deny it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) promptly changed the subject.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And whom are you meeting?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I?
<p/>I've come to meet a pretty woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div>said Oblonsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't say so!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Honi soit qui mal y pense!
<p/>My sister Anna.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>that's Madame Karenina,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), no doubt?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I do.
<p/>Or perhaps not...I really am not sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>Vronsky answered heedlessly, with a vague recollection of something stiff and tedious evoked by the name Karenina.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Alexey Alexandrovitch, my celebrated brother-in-law, you surely must know.
<p/>All the world knows him (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know him (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) by reputation and by sight.

<p/>But you know that's not... not in my line, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky in English.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>)'s a very remarkable man; rather a conservative, but a splendid man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>observed Stepan Arkadyevitch, <div class="bookquote">``a splendid man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, so much the better for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you've come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, addressing a tall old footman of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's, standing at the door; <div class="bookquote">``come here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Besides the charm Oblonsky had in general for everyone, Vronsky had felt of late specially drawn to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) by the fact that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) imagination he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was associated with Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what do you say?
<p/>Shall we give a supper on Sunday for the diva? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) with a smile, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) arm.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course.
<p/>I'm collecting subscriptions.
<p/>Oh, did you make the acquaintance of my friend Levin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will the train soon be in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky asked a railway official.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The train's signaled,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the man.
<p/>The approach of the train was more and more evident by the preparatory bustle in the station, the rush of porters, the movement of policemen and attendants, and people meeting the train.
<p/>Through the frosty vapor could be seen workmen in short sheepskins and soft felt boots crossing the rails of the curving line.
<p/>The hiss of the boiler could be heard on the distant rails, and the rumble of something heavy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who felt a great inclination to tell Vronsky of Levin's intentions in regard to Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you've not got a true impression of Levin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s a very nervous man, and is sometimes out of humor, it's true, but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) is often very nice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s such a true, honest nature, and a heart of gold.
<p/>But yesterday there were special reasons,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>pursued Stepan Arkadyevitch, with a meaning smile, totally oblivious of the genuine sympathy he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had felt the day before for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) friend, and feeling the same sympathy now, only for Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there were reasons why he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not help being either particularly happy or particularly unhappy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky stood still and asked directly: <div class="bookquote">``How so?

 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancied something of the sort yesterday.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that's it!
<p/>I should imagine, though, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might reckon on a better match,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, drawing himself up and walking about again, <div class="bookquote">``though I don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) added.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that is a hateful position!
<p/>That's why most fellows prefer to have to do with Klaras.
<p/>If you don't succeed with them it only proves that you've not enough cash, but in this case one's dignity's at stake.
<p/>But here's the train.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The engine had already whistled in the distance.
<p/>A few instants later the platform was quivering, and with puffs of steam hanging low in the air from the frost, the engine rolled up, with the lever of the middle wheel rhythmically moving up and down, and the stooping figure of the engine-driver covered with frost.
<p/>Behind the tender, setting the platform more and more slowly swaying, came the luggage van with a dog whining in it.
<p/>At last the passenger carriages rolled in, oscillating before coming to a standstill.
<p/>A smart guard jumped out, giving a whistle, and after him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) one by one the impatient passengers began to get down: an officer of the guards, holding himself erect, and looking severely about him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>); a nimble little merchant with a satchel, smiling gaily; a peasant with a sack over his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>Vronsky, standing beside Oblonsky, watched the carriages and the passengers, totally oblivious of his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) mother.
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had just heard about Kitty excited and delighted him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>).
<p/>Unconsciously he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) arched his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) chest, and his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) eyes flashed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) felt himself a conqueror.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Countess Vronskaya is in that compartment,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>said the smart guard, going up to Vronsky.
<p/>The guard's words roused him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>), and forced him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) mother and his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) approaching meeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) did not in his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) heart respect his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) mother, and without acknowledging it to himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), though in accordance with the ideas of the set in which he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) lived, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) own education, he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) could not have conceived of any behavior to his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) mother not in the highest degree respectful and obedient, and the more externally obedient and respectful his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) behavior, the less in his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) respected and loved her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 18   Vronsky followed the guard to the carriage, and at the door of the compartment he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) stopped short to make room for a lady who was getting out.
<p/>With the insight of a man of the world, from one glance at this lady's appearance Vronsky classified her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as belonging to the best society.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) begged pardon, and was getting into the carriage, but felt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) once more; not that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was very beautiful, not on account of the elegance and modest grace which were apparent in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) whole figure, but because in the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) charming face, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) passed close by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), there was something peculiarly caressing and soft.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked round, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) too turned her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shining gray eyes, that looked dark from the thick lashes, rested with friendly attention on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were recognizing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and then promptly turned away to the passing crowd, as though seeking someone.
<p/>In that brief look Vronsky had time to notice the suppressed eagerness which played over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face, and flitted between the brilliant eyes and the faint smile that curved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) red lips.
<p/>It was as though her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nature were so brimming over with something that against her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will it showed itself now in the flash of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes, and now in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) smile.
<p/>Deliberately she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shrouded the light in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes, but it shone against her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will in the faintly perceptible smile.
<p/>Vronsky stepped into the carriage.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mother, a dried-up old lady with black eyes and ringlets, screwed up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes, scanning her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son, and smiled slightly with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thin lips.
<p/>Getting up from the seat and handing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) maid a bag, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) little wrinkled hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son to kiss, and lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) head from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand, kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) on the cheek.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You got my telegram?
<p/>Quite well?
<p/>Thank God.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had a good journey?''
 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/>said her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son, sitting down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and involuntarily listening to a woman's voice outside the door.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) knew it was the voice of the lady he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had met at the door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All the same I don't agree with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady's voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the Petersburg view, madame.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not Petersburg, but simply feminine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) responded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, allow me to kiss your hand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Ivan Petrovitch.
<p/>And could you see if my brother is here, and send him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>said the lady in the doorway, and stepped back again into the compartment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, have you found your brother?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div><p/>said Countess Vronskaya, addressing the lady.
<p/>Vronsky understood now that this was Madame Karenina.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your brother is here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said, standing up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, I did not know you, and, indeed, our acquaintance was so slight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, bowing, <div class="bookquote">``that no doubt you do not remember me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I should have known you because your mother and I have been talking, I think, of nothing but you all the way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) let the eagerness that would insist on coming out show itself in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And still no sign of my brother.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do call him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), Alexey,''  (<font color='red'><b>the countess</b></font>)</div>said the old countess.
<p/>Vronsky stepped out onto the platform and shouted:  <div class="bookquote">``Oblonsky!
<p/>Here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Karenina, however, did not wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) brother, but catching sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) stepped out with her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) light, resolute step.
<p/>And as soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) brother had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>), with a gesture that struck Vronsky by its decision and its grace, she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) flung her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) left arm around his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) neck, drew him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) rapidly to her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>), and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) warmly.
<p/>Vronsky gazed, never taking his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>), and smiled, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could not have said why.
<p/>But recollecting that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mother was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went back again into the carriage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s very sweet, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the countess</b></font>)</div><p/>said the countess of Madame Karenina.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband put her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with me, and I was delighted to have her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>We've been talking all the way.
<p/>And so you, I hear... vous filez le parfait amour.
<p/>Tant mieux, mon cher, tant mieux. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you are referring to, maman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) answered coldly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, maman, let us go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Karenina entered the carriage again to say good-bye to the countess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, countess, you have met your son, and I my brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And all my gossip is exhausted.
<p/>I should have nothing more to tell you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the countess</b></font>)</div>said the countess, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could go all around the world with you and never be dull.
<p/>You are one of those delightful women in whose company it's sweet to be silent as well as to talk.
<p/>Now please don't fret over your son; you can't expect never to be parted.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Karenina stood quite still, holding herself very erect, and her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) eyes were smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna Arkadyevna,''  (<font color='red'><b>the countess</b></font>)</div>the countess said in explanation to her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) son, <div class="bookquote">``has a little son eight years old, I believe, and she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) has never been parted from him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) before, and she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) keeps fretting over leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the countess and I have been talking all the time, I of my son and she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) of hers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Karenina/Karenina</b></font>)</div>said Madame Karenina, and again a smile lighted up her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) face, a caressing smile intended for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, promptly catching the ball of coquetry she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) had flung him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>But apparently she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) turned to the old countess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you so much.
<p/>The time has passed so quickly.
<p/>Good-bye, countess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>the countess</b></font>)</div>answered the countess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me have a kiss of your pretty face.
<p/>I speak plainly, at my age, and I tell you simply that I've lost my heart to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Stereotyped as the phrase was, Madame Karenina obviously believed it and was delighted by it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) flushed, bent down slightly, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) cheek to the countess's lips, drew herself up again, and with the same smile fluttering between her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) lips and her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) hand to Vronsky.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) pressed the little hand she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and was delighted, as though at something special, by the energetic squeeze with which she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) freely and vigorously shook his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hand.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) went out with the rapid step which bore her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) rather fully-developed figure with such strange lightness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very charming,''  (<font color='red'><b>the countess</b></font>)</div>said the countess.
<p/>That was just what her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) son was thinking.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) eyes followed her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) till her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) graceful figure was out of sight, and then the smile remained on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) saw out of the window how she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) brother, put her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) arm in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and began telling him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) something eagerly, obviously something that had nothing to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), Vronsky, and at that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) felt annoyed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, maman, are you perfectly well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) repeated, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything has been delightful.
<p/>Alexander has been very good, and Marie has grown very pretty.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s very interesting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) began telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexander</b></font>) again of what interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) most--the christening of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) grandson, for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been staying in Petersburg, and the special favor shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) elder son by the Tsar.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's Lavrenty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, looking out of the window; <div class="bookquote">``now we can go, if you like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>The old butler who had traveled with the countess, came to the carriage to announce that everything was ready, and the countess got up to go.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come; there's not such a crowd now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky.
<p/>The maid took a handbag and the lap dog, the butler and a porter the other baggage.
<p/>Vronsky gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mother his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) arm; but just as they were getting out of the carriage several men ran suddenly by with panic-stricken faces.
<p/>The station-master, too, ran by in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) extraordinary colored cap.
<p/>Obviously something unusual had happened.
<p/>The crowd who had left the train were running back again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?...
<p/>What?...
<p/>Where?...
<p/>Flung himself!...
<p/>Crushed!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>was heard among the crowd.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) sister on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) arm, turned back.
<p/>They too looked scared, and stopped at the carriage door to avoid the crowd.
<p/>The ladies got in, while Vronsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch followed the crowd to find out details of the disaster.
<p/>A guard, either drunk or too much muffled up in the bitter frost, had not heard the train moving back, and had been crushed.
<p/>Before Vronsky and Oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts from the butler.
<p/>Oblonsky and Vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse.
<p/>Oblonsky was evidently upset.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) frowned and seemed ready to cry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, how awful!
<p/>Ah, Anna, if you had seen it!
<p/>Ah, how awful!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said.
<p/>Vronsky did not speak; his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) handsome face was serious, but perfectly composed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you had seen it, countess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) wife was there....
<p/>It was awful to see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)!....
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) flung herself on the body.
<p/>They say he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was the only support of an immense family.
<p/>How awful!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't one do anything for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Karenina/Karenina</b></font>)</div><p/>said Madame Karenina in an agitated whisper.
<p/>Vronsky glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and immediately got out of the carriage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be back directly, maman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) remarked, turning round in the doorway.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) came back a few minutes later, Stepan Arkadyevitch was already in conversation with the countess about the new singer, while the countess was impatiently looking towards the door, waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) son.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now let us be off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, coming in.
<p/>They went out together.
<p/>Vronsky was in front with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mother.
<p/>Behind walked Madame Karenina with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother.
<p/>Just as they were going out of the station the station-master overtook Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You gave my assistant two hundred roubles.
<p/>Would you kindly explain for whose benefit you intend them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the widow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought there was no need to ask.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You gave that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Oblonsky, behind, and, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) sister's hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``Very nice, very nice!
<p/>Isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) a splendid fellow?
<p/>Good-bye, countess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) sister stood still, looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) maid.
<p/>When they went out the Vronsky's carriage had already driven away.
<p/>People coming in were still talking of what happened.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a horrible death!''
 (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>said a gentleman, passing by.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They say he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was cut in two pieces.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, I think it's the easiest--instantaneous,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observed another.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is it they don't take proper precautions?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>said a third.
<p/>Madame Karenina seated herself in the carriage, and Stepan Arkadyevitch saw with surprise that her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) lips were quivering, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was with difficulty restraining her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) tears.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, Anna?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) asked, when they had driven a few hundred yards.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's an omen of evil,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've come, that's the chief thing.
<p/>You can't conceive how I'm resting my hopes on you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you known Vronsky long?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.
<p/>You know we're hoping he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) will marry Kitty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna softly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come now, let us talk of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) added, tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would physically shake off something superfluous oppressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us talk of your affairs.
<p/>I got your letter, and here I am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, all my hopes are in you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, tell me all about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>And Stepan Arkadyevitch began to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) story.
<p/>On reaching home Oblonsky helped his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sister out, sighed, pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hand, and set off to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) office.
<p/>Chapter 19   When Anna went into the room, Dolly was sitting in the little drawing-room with a white-headed fat little boy, already like his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a lesson in French reading.
<p/>As the boy read, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) kept twisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) jacket.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother had several times taken his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand from it, but the fat little hand went back to the button again.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother pulled the button off and put it in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pocket.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep your hands still, Grisha,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) work, a coverlet she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had long been making.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) always set to work on it at depressed moments, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knitted at it nervously, twitching her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fingers and counting the stitches.
<p/>Though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had sent word the day before to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband that it was nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) whether his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sister came or not, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had made everything ready for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arrival, and was expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sister-in-law with emotion.
<p/>Dolly was crushed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) sorrow, utterly swallowed up by it.
<p/>Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) did not forget that Anna, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sister-in-law, was the wife of one of the most important personages in Petersburg, and was a Petersburg  grande dame .
<p/>And, thanks to this circumstance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not carry out her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) threat to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband--that is to say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) remembered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sister-in-law was coming.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, after all, Anna is in no wise to blame,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>thought Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) except the very best, and I have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) towards myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was true that as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) could recall her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) impressions at Petersburg at the Karenins', she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) did not like their household itself; there was something artificial in the whole framework of their family life.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should I not receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)?
<p/>If only she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) doesn't take it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) head to console me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All consolation and counsel and Christian forgiveness, all that I have thought over a thousand times, and it's all no use.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>All these days Dolly had been alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) children.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) did not want to talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) sorrow, but with that sorrow in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) could not talk of outside matters.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) knew that in one way or another she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) would tell Anna everything, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was alternately glad at the thought of speaking freely, and angry at the necessity of speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) humiliation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) sister, and of hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ready-made phrases of good advice and comfort.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been on the lookout for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), glancing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) watch every minute, and, as so often happens, let slip just that minute when her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) visitor arrived, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not hear the bell.
<p/>Catching a sound of skirts and light steps at the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked round, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) care-worn face unconsciously expressed not gladness, but wonder.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) got up and embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sister-in-law.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, here already!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly, how glad I am to see you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, faintly smiling, and trying by the expression of Anna's face to find out whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) knew.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most likely she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) knows,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) thought, noticing the sympathy in Anna's face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, come along, I'll take you to your room,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went on, trying to defer as long as possible the moment of confidences.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this Grisha?
<p/>Heavens, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)'s grown!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna; and kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), never taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes off Dolly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) stood still and flushed a little.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, please, let us stay here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) kerchief and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) hat, and catching it in a lock of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) black hair, which was a mass of curls, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) head and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) hair down.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are radiant with health and happiness!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dolly, almost with envy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I?....
<p/>Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Merciful heavens, Tanya!
<p/>You're the same age as my Seryozha,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) added, addressing the little girl as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ran in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) arms and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Delightful child, delightful!
<p/>Show me them all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mentioned them, not only remembering the names, but the years, months, characters, illnesses of all the children, and Dolly could not but appreciate that.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, we will go to them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a pity Vassya's asleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/>After seeing the children, they sat down, alone now, in the drawing room, to coffee.
<p/>Anna took the tray, and then pushed it away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) has told me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly looked coldly at Anna; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was waiting now for phrases of conventional sympathy, but Anna said nothing of the sort.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to speak for him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to you, nor to try to comfort you; that's impossible.
<p/>But, darling, I'm simply sorry, sorry from my heart for you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Under the thick lashes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) shining eyes tears suddenly glittered.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) moved nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sister-in-law and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) vigorous little hand.
<p/>Dolly did not shrink away, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) face did not lose its frigid expression.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said:  <div class="bookquote">``To comfort me's impossible.
<p/>Everything's lost after what has happened, everything's over!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>And directly she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had said this, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) face suddenly softened.
<p/>Anna lifted the wasted, thin hand of Dolly, kissed it and said:  <div class="bookquote">``But, Dolly, what's to be done, what's to be done?
<p/>How is it best to act in this awful position--that's what you must think of.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All's over, and there's nothing more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the worst of all is, you see, that I can't cast him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) off: there are the children, I am tied.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly, darling, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has spoken to me, but I want to hear it from you: tell me about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) inquiringly.
<p/>Sympathy and love unfeigned were visible on Anna's face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said all at once.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I will tell you it from the beginning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you imagine he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) realizes all the awfulness of my position?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly resumed.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna interposed quickly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s good-hearted, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s proud, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s so humiliated.

<p/>`No, no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) cannot forgive me,' he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) keeps saying.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly looked dreamily away beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) sister-in-law as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) words.

<p/>But as though of set design, each time she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was softened she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) began to speak again of what exasperated her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s young, you see, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, Anna, my youth and my beauty are gone, taken by whom?

<p/>No doubt they talked of me together, or, worse still, they were silent.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Again her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes glowed with hatred.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And after that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will tell me....  What!

<p/>Why are the children here?
<p/>What's so awful is that all at once my heart's turned, and instead of love and tenderness, I have nothing but hatred for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); yes, hatred.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Darling Dolly, I understand, but don't torture yourself.

 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly grew calmer, and for two minutes both were silent.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's to be done?

<p/>I have thought over everything, and I see nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna could think of nothing, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart responded instantly to each word, to each change of expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sister-in-law.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>Dolly was beginning, but Anna cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) short, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) hand once more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, how glad I am you came.
<p/>It has made things better, ever so much better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 20   The whole of that day Anna spent at home, that's to say at the Oblonskys', and received no one, though some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) acquaintances had already heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) arrival, and came to call; the same day.
<p/>Anna spent the whole morning with Dolly and the children.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) merely sent a brief note to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) brother to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) must not fail to dine at home.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, God is merciful,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) wrote.
<p/>Oblonsky did dine at home: the conversation was general, and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife, speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as <div class="bookquote">``Stiva,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not done before.
<p/>In the relations of the husband and wife the same estrangement still remained, but there was no talk now of separation, and Stepan Arkadyevitch saw the possibility of explanation and reconciliation.
<p/>Immediately after dinner Kitty came in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knew Anna Arkadyevna, but only very slightly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) came now to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sister's with some trepidation, at the prospect of meeting this fashionable Petersburg lady, whom everyone spoke so highly of.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made a favorable impression on Anna Arkadyevna--she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) saw that at once.
<p/>Anna was unmistakably admiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) loveliness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) youth: before Kitty knew where she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) found herself not merely under Anna's sway, but in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), as young girls do fall in love with older and married women.
<p/>Anna was not like a fashionable lady, nor the mother of a boy of eight years old.
<p/>In the elasticity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) movements, the freshness and the unflagging eagerness which persisted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face, and broke out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) smile and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) glance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would rather have passed for a girl of twenty, had it not been for a serious and at times mournful look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes, which struck and attracted Kitty.
<p/>Kitty felt that Anna was perfectly simple and was concealing nothing, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had another higher world of interests inaccessible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), complex and poetic.
<p/>After dinner, when Dolly went away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) own room, Anna rose quickly and went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) brother, who was just lighting a cigar.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stiva,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), winking gaily, crossing him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and glancing towards the door, <div class="bookquote">``go, and God help you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) threw down the cigar, understanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and departed through the doorway.
<p/>When Stepan Arkadyevitch had disappeared, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went back to the sofa where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been sitting, surrounded by the children.
<p/>Either because the children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt, or that they felt a special charm in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) themselves, the two elder ones, and the younger following their lead, as children so often do, had clung about their new aunt since before dinner, and would not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) side.
<p/>And it had become a sort of game among them to sit a close as possible to their aunt, to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), hold her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) little hand, kiss it, play with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ring, or even touch the flounce of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) skirt.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, as we were sitting before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna Arkadyevna, sitting down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) place.
<p/>And again Grisha poked his (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) little face under her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) arm, and nestled with his (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) gown, beaming with pride and happiness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when is your next ball?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) asked Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Next week, and a splendid ball.
<p/>One of those balls where one always enjoys oneself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, are there balls where one always enjoys oneself?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna said, with tender irony.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's strange, but there are.
<p/>At the Bobrishtchevs' one always enjoys oneself, and at the Nikitins' too, while at the Mezhkovs' it's always dull.
<p/>Haven't you noticed it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear, for me there are no balls now where one enjoys oneself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, and Kitty detected in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes that mysterious world which was not open to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For me there are some less dull and tiresome.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can  you  be dull at a ball?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should not  I  be dull at a ball?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>inquired Anna.
<p/>Kitty perceived that Anna knew what answer would follow.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you always look nicer than anyone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna had the faculty of blushing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) blushed a little, and said:  <div class="bookquote">``In the first place it's never so; and secondly, if it were, what difference would it make to me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you coming to this ball?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I imagine it won't be possible to avoid going.
<p/>Here, take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said to Tanya, who was pulling the loosely-fitting ring off her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) white, slender-tipped finger.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be so glad if you go.
<p/>I should so like to see you at a ball.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyway, if I do go, I shall comfort myself with the thought that it's a pleasure to you...Grisha, don't pull my hair.
<p/>It's untidy enough without that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, putting up a straying lock, which Grisha had been playing with.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I imagine you at the ball in lilac.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why in lilac precisely?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Anna, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, children, run along, run along.
<p/>Do you hear?
<p/>Miss Hoole is calling you to tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hoole</b></font>) said, tearing the children from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hoole</b></font>), and sending them off to the dining room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know why you press me to come to the ball.
<p/>You expect a great deal of this ball, and you want everyone to be there to take part in it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know?
<p/>Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>what a happy time you are at,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>pursued Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember, and I know that blue haze like the mist on the mountains in Switzerland.
<p/>That mist which covers everything in that blissful time when childhood is just ending, and out of that vast circle, happy and gay, there is a path growing narrower and narrower, and it is delightful and alarming to enter the ballroom, bright and splendid as it is....  Who has not been through it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty smiled without speaking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how did she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) go through it?
<p/>How I should like to know all her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) love story!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Kitty, recalling the unromantic appearance of Alexey Alexandrovitch, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know something.
<p/>Stiva told me, and I congratulate you.
<p/>I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>Anna continued.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I met Vronsky at the railway station.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Kitty, blushing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was it Stiva told you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stiva gossiped about it all.
<p/>And I should be so glad...I traveled yesterday with Vronsky's mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went on; <div class="bookquote">``and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mother talked without a pause of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)'s her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) favorite.
<p/>I know mothers are partial, but...''   (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What did his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mother tell you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, a great deal!
<p/>And I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)'s her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) favorite; still one can see how chivalrous he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) is....  Well, for instance, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had wanted to give up all his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) property to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) brother, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had done something extraordinary when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was quite a child, saved a woman out of the water.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)'s a hero, in fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, smiling and recollecting the two hundred roubles he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had given at the station.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not tell Kitty about the two hundred roubles.
<p/>For some reason it was disagreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to think of it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt that there was something that had to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) in it, and something that ought not to have been.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) pressed me very much to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>Anna went on; <div class="bookquote">``and I shall be glad to go to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tomorrow.
<p/>Stiva is staying a long while in Dolly's room, thank God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>Anna added, changing the subject, and getting up, Kitty fancied, displeased with something.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm first!
<p/>No, I!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/>screamed the children, who had finished tea, running up to their Aunt Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All together,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ran laughing to meet them, and embraced and swung round all the throng of swarming children, shrieking with delight.
<p/>Chapter 21   Dolly came out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) room to the tea of the grown-up people.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch did not come out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must have left his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wife's room by the other door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you'll be cold upstairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>observed Dolly, addressing Anna; <div class="bookquote">``I want to move you downstairs, and we shall be nearer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please, don't trouble about me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>answered Anna, looking intently into Dolly's face, trying to make out whether there had been a reconciliation or not.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be lighter for you here,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>)</div>answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sister-in-law.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you that I sleep everywhere, and always like a marmot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the question?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>inquired Stepan Arkadyevitch, coming out of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) room and addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wife.
<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) tone both Kitty and Anna knew that a reconciliation had taken place.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to move Anna downstairs, but we must hang up blinds.
<p/>No one knows how to do it; I must see to it myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>answered Dolly addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``God knows whether they are fully reconciled,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>thought Anna, hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tone, cold and composed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nonsense, Dolly, always making difficulties,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) husband.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, I'll do it all, if you like...''   (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they must be reconciled,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>thought Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know how you do everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>answered Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You tell Matvey to do what can't be done, and go away yourself, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to make a muddle of everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) habitual, mocking smile curved the corners of Dolly's lips as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) spoke.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Full, full reconciliation, full,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>thought Anna; <div class="bookquote">``thank God!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>and rejoicing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was the cause of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went up to Dolly and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all.
<p/>Why do you always look down on me and Matvey?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling hardly perceptibly, and addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife.
<p/>The whole evening Dolly was, as always, a little mocking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) tone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) husband, while Stepan Arkadyevitch was happy and cheerful, but not so as to seem as though, having been forgiven, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) offense.
<p/>At half-past nine o'clock a particularly joyful and pleasant family conversation over the tea-table at the Oblonskys' was broken up by an apparently simple incident.
<p/>But this simple incident for some reason struck everyone as strange.
<p/>Talking about common acquaintances in Petersburg, Anna got up quickly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is in my album,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and, by the way, I'll show you my Seryozha,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) added, with a mother's smile of pride.
<p/>Towards ten o'clock, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) usually said good-night to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son, and often before going to a ball put him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to bed herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt depressed at being so far from him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); and whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was talking about, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) kept coming back in thought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) curly-headed Seryozha.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) longed to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) photograph and talk of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>Seizing the first pretext, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) got up, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) light, resolute step went for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) album.
<p/>The stairs up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase.
<p/>Just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was leaving the drawing room, a ring was heard in the hall.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who can that be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's early for me to be fetched, and for anyone else it's late,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>observed Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure to be someone with papers for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>put in Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>When Anna was passing the top of the staircase, a servant was running up to announce the visitor, while the visitor himself was standing under a lamp.
<p/>Anna glancing down at once recognized Vronsky, and a strange feeling of pleasure and at the same time of dread of something stirred in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was standing still, not taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) coat, pulling something out of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>At the instant when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was just facing the stairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) eyes, caught sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and into the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) face there passed a shade of embarrassment and dismay.
<p/>With a slight inclination of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) passed, hearing behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) Stepan Arkadyevitch's loud voice calling him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) to come up, and the quiet, soft, and composed voice of Vronsky refusing.
<p/>When Anna returned with the album, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was already gone, and Stepan Arkadyevitch was telling them that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had called to inquire about the dinner they were giving next day to a celebrity who had just arrived.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And nothing would induce him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) to come up.
<p/>What a queer fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>added Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>Kitty blushed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was the only person who knew why he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had come, and why he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) would not come up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) has been at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``and didn't find me, and thought I should be here, but he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) did not come up because he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) thought it late, and Anna's here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>All of them looked at each other, saying nothing, and began to look at Anna's album.
<p/>There was nothing either exceptional or strange in a man's calling at half-past nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed dinner party and not coming in, but it seemed strange to all of them.
<p/>Above all, it seemed strange and not right to Anna.
<p/>Chapter 22   The ball was only just beginning as Kitty and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother walked up the great staircase, flooded with light, and lined with flowers and footmen in powder and red coats.
<p/>From the rooms came a constant, steady hum, as from a hive, and the rustle of movement; and while on the landing between trees they gave last touches to their hair and dresses before the mirror, they heard from the ballroom the careful, distinct notes of the fiddles of the orchestra beginning the first waltz.
<p/>A little old man in civilian dress, arranging his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gray curls before another mirror, and diffusing an odor of scent, stumbled against them on the stairs, and stood aside, evidently admiring Kitty, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not know.
<p/>A beardless youth, one of those society youths whom the old Prince Shtcherbatsky called <div class="bookquote">``young bucks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Shtcherbatsky/Prince Shtcherbatsky/Prince</b></font>)</div>in an exceedingly open waistcoat, straightening his (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatsky</b></font>) white tie as he (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatsky</b></font>) went, bowed to them, and after running by, came back to ask Kitty for a quadrille.
<p/>As the first quadrille had already been given to Vronsky, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had to promise this youth the second.
<p/>An officer, buttoning his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) glove, stood aside in the doorway, and stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) mustache, admired rosy Kitty.
<p/>Although her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) dress, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) coiffure, and all the preparations for the ball had cost Kitty great trouble and consideration, at this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) walked into the ballroom in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip as easily and simply as though all the rosettes and lace, all the minute details of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) attire, had not cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) family a moment's attention, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had been born in that tulle and lace, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hair done up high on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) head, and a rose and two leaves on the top of it.
<p/>When, just before entering the ballroom, the princess, her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) mother, tried to turn right side out of the ribbon of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) sash, Kitty had drawn back a little.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt that everything must be right of itself, and graceful, and nothing could need setting straight.
<p/>It was one of Kitty's best days.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) dress was not uncomfortable anywhere; her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) lace berthe did not droop anywhere; her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) rosettes were not crushed nor torn off; her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) pink slippers with high, hollowed-out heels did not pinch, but gladdened her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) feet; and the thick rolls of fair chignon kept up on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) head as if they were her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own hair.
<p/>All the three buttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hand without concealing its lines.
<p/>The black velvet of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) locket nestled with special softness round her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) neck.
<p/>That velvet was delicious; at home, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) neck in the looking glass, Kitty had felt that that velvet was speaking.
<p/>About all the rest there might be a doubt, but the velvet was delicious.
<p/>Kitty smiled here too, at the ball, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) glanced at it in the glass.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) bare shoulders and arms gave Kitty a sense of chill marble, a feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) particularly liked.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes sparkled, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) rosy lips could not keep from smiling from the consciousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own attractiveness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had scarcely entered the ballroom and reached the throng of ladies, all tulle, ribbons, lace, and flowers, waiting to be asked to dance--Kitty was never one of that throng--when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was asked for a waltz, and asked by the best partner, the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom, a renowned director of dances, a married man, handsome and well-built, Yegorushka Korsunsky.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had only just left the Countess Bonina, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had danced the first half of the waltz, and, scanning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kingdom--that is to say, a few couples who had started dancing--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caught sight of Kitty, entering, and flew up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) with that peculiar, easy amble which is confined to directors of balls.
<p/>Without even asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) cared to dance, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm to encircle her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) slender waist.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) looked round for someone to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) fan to, and their hostess, smiling to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), took it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How nice you've come in good time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) waist; <div class="bookquote">``such a bad habit to be late.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Bending her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) left hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) laid it on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) little feet in their pink slippers began swiftly, lightly, and rhythmically moving over the slippery floor in time to the music.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a rest to waltz with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), as they fell into the first slow steps of the waltz.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's exquisite--such lightness, precision.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) the same thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to almost all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) partners whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew well.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) smiled at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) praise, and continued to look about the room over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was not like a girl at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) first ball, for whom all faces in the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was not a girl who had gone the stale round of balls till every face in the ballroom was familiar and tiresome.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was in the middle stage between these two; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was excited, and at the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had sufficient self-possession to be able to observe.
<p/>In the left corner of the ballroom she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) saw the cream of society gathered together.
<p/>There--incredibly naked--was the beauty Lidi, Korsunsky's wife; there was the lady of the house; there shone the bald head of Krivin, always to be found where the best people were.
<p/>In that direction gazed the young men, not venturing to approach.
<p/>There, too, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) descried Stiva, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw the exquisite figure and head of Anna in a black velvet gown.
<p/>And  he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)  was there.
<p/>Kitty had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) since the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) refused Levin.
<p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) long-sighted eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) at once, and was even aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Another turn, eh?
<p/>You're not tired?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Korsunsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Korsunsky, a little out of breath.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where shall I take you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame Karenina's here, I think...take me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wherever you command.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Korsunsky</b></font>)</div><p/>And Korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight towards the group in the left corner, continually saying, <div class="bookquote">``Pardon, mesdames, pardon, pardon, mesdames'' (<font color='red'><b>Korsunsky</b></font>)</div>; and steering his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) course through the sea of lace, tulle, and ribbon, and not disarranging a feather, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) partner sharply round, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) slim ankles, in light transparent stockings, were exposed to view, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) train floated out in fan shape and covered Krivin's knees.
<p/>Korsunsky bowed, set straight his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) open shirt front, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) arm to conduct her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to Anna Arkadyevna.
<p/>Kitty, flushed, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) train from Krivin's knees, and, a little giddy, looked round, seeking Anna.
<p/>Anna was not in lilac, as Kitty had so urgently wished, but in a black, low-cut, velvet gown, showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) full throat and shoulders, that looked as though carved in old ivory, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) rounded arms, with tiny, slender wrists.
<p/>The whole gown was trimmed with Venetian guipure.
<p/>On her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) head, among her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) black hair--her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own, with no false additions--was a little wreath of pansies, and a bouquet of the same in the black ribbon of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sash among white lace.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) coiffure was not striking.
<p/>All that was noticeable was the little wilful tendrils of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) curly hair that would always break free about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) neck and temples.
<p/>Round her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) well-cut, strong neck was a thread of pearls.
<p/>Kitty had been seeing Anna every day; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) adored her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and had pictured her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) invariably in lilac.
<p/>But now seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in black, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not fully seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) charm.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) now as someone quite new and surprising to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) understood that Anna could not have been in lilac, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) charm was just that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) always stood out against her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) attire, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dress could never be noticeable on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) black dress, with its sumptuous lace, was not noticeable on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>); it was only the frame, and all that was seen was she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)--simple, natural, elegant, and at the same time gay and eager.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was standing holding herself, as always, very erect, and when Kitty drew near the group she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was speaking to the master of the house, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) head slightly turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't throw stones,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was saying, in answer to something, <div class="bookquote">``though I can't understand it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) went on, shrugging her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) shoulders, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) turned at once with a soft smile of protection towards Kitty.
<p/>With a flying, feminine glance she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) scanned her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) attire, and made a movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) head, hardly perceptible, but understood by Kitty, signifying approval of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) dress and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) looks.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You came into the room dancing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) added.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is one of my most faithful supporters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Korsunsky</b></font>)</div>said Korsunsky, bowing to Anna Arkadyevna, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had not yet seen.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The princess helps to make balls happy and successful.
<p/>Anna Arkadyevna, a waltz?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, bending down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, have you met?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>inquired their host.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there anyone we have not met?
<p/>My wife and I are like white wolves--everyone knows us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Korsunsky</b></font>)</div>answered Korsunsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A waltz, Anna Arkadyevna?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't dance when it's possible not to dance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But tonight it's impossible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Korsunsky</b></font>)</div>answered Korsunsky.
<p/>At that instant Vronsky came up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, since it's impossible tonight, let us start,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) said, not noticing Vronsky's bow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) hastily put her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) hand on Korsunsky's shoulder.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) vexed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Kitty, discerning that Anna had intentionally not responded to Vronsky's bow.
<p/>Vronsky went up to Kitty reminding her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) of the first quadrille, and expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) all this time.
<p/>Kitty gazed in admiration at Anna waltzing, and listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) for a waltz, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) did not, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) glanced wonderingly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) flushed slightly, and hurriedly asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to waltz, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had only just put his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) waist and taken the first step when the music suddenly stopped.
<p/>Kitty looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) face, which was so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own, and long afterwards--for several years after--that look, full of love, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) made no response, cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to the heart with an agony of shame.  ''
<p/>Pardon!
<p/>pardon!
<p/>Waltz!
<p/>waltz!''
<p/>shouted Korsunsky from the other side of the room, and seizing the first young lady he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) came across he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) began dancing himself.
<p/>Chapter 23   Vronsky and Kitty waltzed several times round the room.
<p/>After the first waltz Kitty went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had hardly time to say a few words to Countess Nordston when Vronsky came up again for the first quadrille.
<p/>During the quadrille nothing of any significance was said: there was disjointed talk between them of the Korsunskys, husband and wife, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) described very amusingly, as delightful children at forty, and of the future town theater; and only once the conversation touched her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to the quick, when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) about Levin, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was here, and added that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) so much.
<p/>But Kitty did not expect much from the quadrille.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) looked forward with a thrill at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) heart to the mazurka.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) fancied that in the mazurka everything must be decided.
<p/>The fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not during the quadrille ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) for the mazurka did not trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) would dance the mazurka with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had done at former balls, and refused five young men, saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was engaged for the mazurka.
<p/>The whole ball up to the last quadrille was for Kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors, sounds, and motions.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) only sat down when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt too tired and begged for a rest.
<p/>But as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was dancing the last quadrille with one of the tiresome young men whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not refuse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) chanced to be vis-a-vis with Vronsky and Anna.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not been near Anna again since the beginning of the evening, and now again she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) suddenly quite new and surprising.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) the signs of that excitement of success she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew so well in herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was intoxicated with the delighted admiration she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was exciting.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that feeling and knew its signs, and saw them in Anna; saw the quivering, flashing light in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes, and the smile of happiness and excitement unconsciously playing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lips, and the deliberate grace, precision, and lightness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) movements.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All or one?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>And not assisting the harassed young man she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was dancing with in the conversation, the thread of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lost and could not pick up again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) obeyed with external liveliness the peremptory shouts of Korsunsky starting them all into the  grand rond , and then into the  ch√¢ine , and at the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) kept watch with a growing pang at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's not the admiration of the crowd has intoxicated her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), but the adoration of one.
<p/>And that one?
<p/>can it be he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Every time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke to Anna the joyous light flashed into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes, and the smile of happiness curved her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) red lips.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) seemed to make an effort to control herself, to try not to show these signs of delight, but they came out on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face of themselves.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and was filled with terror.
<p/>What was pictured so clearly to Kitty in the mirror of Anna's face she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>What had become of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always self-possessed resolute manner, and the carelessly serene expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face?
<p/>Now every time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have fallen at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) feet, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes there was nothing but humble submission and dread.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not offend you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes seemed every time to be saying, <div class="bookquote">``but I want to save myself, and I don't know how.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was a look such as Kitty had never seen before.
<p/>They were speaking of common acquaintances, keeping up the most trivial conversation, but to Kitty it seemed that every word they said was determining their fate and hers.
<p/>And strange it was that they were actually talking of how absurd Ivan Ivanovitch was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) French, and how the Eletsky girl might have made a better match, yet these words had all the while consequence for them, and they were feeling just as Kitty did.
<p/>The whole ball, the whole world, everything seemed lost in fog in Kitty's soul.
<p/>Nothing but the stern discipline of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) bringing-up supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) and forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to do what was expected of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), that is, to dance, to answer questions, to talk, even to smile.
<p/>But before the mazurka, when they were beginning to rearrange the chairs and a few couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big room, a moment of despair and horror came for Kitty.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had refused five partners, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was not dancing the mazurka.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had not even a hope of being asked for it, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was so successful in society that the idea would never occur to anyone that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had remained disengaged till now.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) would have to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt ill and go home, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had not the strength to do this.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt crushed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) went to the furthest end of the little drawing room and sank into a low chair.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) light, transparent skirts rose like a cloud about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) slender waist; one bare, thin, soft, girlish arm, hanging listlessly, was lost in the folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) pink tunic; in the other she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) fan, and with rapid, short strokes fanned her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) burning face.
<p/>But while she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) looked like a butterfly, clinging to a blade of grass, and just about to open its rainbow wings for fresh flight, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) heart ached with a horrible despair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But perhaps I am wrong, perhaps it was not so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And again she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) recalled all she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had seen.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kitty, what is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Countess Nordston</b></font>)</div><p/>said Countess Nordston, stepping noiselessly over the carpet towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Nordston</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty's lower lip began to quiver; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) got up quickly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kitty, you're not dancing the mazurka?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty in a voice shaking with tears.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) for the mazurka before me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess Nordston</b></font>)</div>said Countess Nordston, knowing Kitty would understand who were <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said: `Why, aren't you going to dance it with Princess Shtcherbatskaya?'''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't care!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>answered Kitty.
<p/>No one but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) herself understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) position; no one knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had just refused the man whom perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) loved, and refused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had put her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) faith in another.
<p/>Countess Nordston found Korsunsky, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) was to dance the mazurka, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to ask Kitty.
<p/>Kitty danced in the first couple, and luckily for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had not to talk, because Korsunsky was all the time running about directing the figure.
<p/>Vronsky and Anna sat almost opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw them with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) long-sighted eyes, and saw them, too, close by, when they met in the figures, and the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw of them the more convinced was she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) unhappiness was complete.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw that they felt themselves alone in that crowded room.
<p/>And on Vronsky's face, always so firm and independent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw that look that had struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), of bewilderment and humble submissiveness, like the expression of an intelligent dog when it has done wrong.
<p/>Anna smiled, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) smile was reflected by him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) grew thoughtful, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) became serious.
<p/>Some supernatural force drew Kitty's eyes to Anna's face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was fascinating in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) simple black dress, fascinating were her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) round arms with their bracelets, fascinating was her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) firm neck with its thread of pearls, fascinating the straying curls of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) loose hair, fascinating the graceful, light movements of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) little feet and hands, fascinating was that lovely face in its eagerness, but there was something terrible and cruel in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) fascination.
<p/>Kitty admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) more than ever, and more and more acute was her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) suffering.
<p/>Kitty felt overwhelmed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face showed it.
<p/>When Vronsky saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), coming across her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) in the mazurka, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) did not at once recognize her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was so changed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Delightful ball!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), for the sake of saying something.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) answered.
<p/>In the middle of the mazurka, repeating a complicated figure, newly invented by Korsunsky, Anna came forward into the center of the circle, chose two gentlemen, and summoned a lady and Kitty.
<p/>Kitty gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) in dismay as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) went up.
<p/>Anna looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with drooping eyelids, and smiled, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand.
<p/>But, noticing that Kitty only responded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) smile by a look of despair and amazement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) turned away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and began gaily talking to the other lady.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there is something uncanny, devilish and fascinating in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>Kitty said to herself.
<p/>Anna did not mean to stay to supper, but the master of the house began to press her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to do so.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Anna Arkadyevna,''  (<font color='red'><b>Korsunsky</b></font>)</div>said Korsunsky, drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) bare arm under the sleeve of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) dress coat, <div class="bookquote">``I've such an idea for a cotillion!
<p/>Un bijou! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Korsunsky</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) moved gradually on, trying to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) along with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
<p/>Their host smiled approvingly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am not going to stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>answered Anna, smiling, but in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) smile, both Korsunsky and the master of the house saw from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) resolute tone that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would not stay.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; why, as it is, I have danced more at your ball in Moscow than I have all the winter in Petersburg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, looking round at Vronsky, who stood near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must rest a little before my journey.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you certainly going tomorrow then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>answered Anna, as it were wondering at the boldness of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) question; but the irrepressible, quivering brilliance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) smile set him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) on fire as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said it.
<p/>Anna Arkadyevna did not stay to supper, but went home.
<p/>Chapter 24   <div class="bookquote">``Yes, there is something in me hateful, repulsive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>thought Levin, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) came away from the Shtcherbatskys', and walked in the direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's lodgings.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I don't get on with other people.
<p/>Pride, they say.
<p/>No, I have no pride.
<p/>If I had any pride, I should not have put myself in such a position.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pictured to himself Vronsky, happy, good-natured, clever, and self-possessed, certainly never placed in the awful position in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been that evening.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was bound to choose him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>So it had to be, and I cannot complain of anyone or anything.

<p/>What right had I to imagine she (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would care to join her (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) life to mine?
<p/>Who am I and what am I?

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) recalled his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother Nikolay, and dwelt with pleasure on the thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) right that everything in the world is base and loathsome?
<p/>And are we fair in our judgment of brother Nikolay?
<p/>Of course, from the point of view of Prokofy, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) in a torn cloak and tipsy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>)'s a despicable person.
<p/>But I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) differently.
<p/>I know his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) soul, and know that we are like him (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>).
<p/>And I, instead of going to seek him (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) out, went out to dinner, and came here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin walked up to a lamppost, read his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's address, which was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pocketbook, and called a sledge.
<p/>All the long way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's, Levin vividly recalled all the facts familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother Nikolay's life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) remembered how his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, while at the university, and for a year afterwards, had, in spite of the jeers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) companions, lived like a monk, strictly observing all religious rites, services, and fasts, and avoiding every sort of pleasure, especially women.
<p/>And afterwards, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had all at once broken out: he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had associated with the most horrible people, and rushed into the most senseless debauchery.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) remembered later the scandal over a boy, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had taken from the country to bring up, and, in a fit of rage, had so violently beaten that proceedings were brought against him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) for unlawfully wounding.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) recalled the scandal with a sharper, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had lost money, and given a promissory note, and against whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had himself lodged a complaint, asserting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had cheated him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>-LRB-This was the money Sergey Ivanovitch had paid.-RRB-
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) remembered how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had spent a night in the lockup for disorderly conduct in the street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) remembered the shameful proceedings he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had tried to get up against his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother Sergey Ivanovitch, accusing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) of not having paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) share of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) mother's fortune, and the last scandal, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had gone to a western province in an official capacity, and there had got into trouble for assaulting a village elder....
<p/>It was all horribly disgusting, yet to Levin it appeared not at all in the same disgusting light as it inevitably would to those who did not know Nikolay, did not know all his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) story, did not know his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Levin remembered that when Nikolay had been in the devout stage, the period of fasts and monks and church services, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) was seeking in religion a support and a curb for his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) passionate temperament, everyone, far from encouraging him (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>), had jeered at him (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>), too, with the others.
<p/>They had teased him (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>), called him (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) Noah and Monk; and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) had broken out, no one had helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>), but everyone had turned away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) with horror and disgust.
<p/>Levin felt that, in spite of all the ugliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) life, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother Nikolay, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) soul, in the very depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) soul, was no more in the wrong than the people who despised him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not to blame for having been born with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) unbridled temperament and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) somehow limited intelligence.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had always wanted to be good.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) everything, without reserve, and I will make him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) speak without reserve, too, and I'll show him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and so understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin resolved to himself, as, towards eleven o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) reached the hotel of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had the address.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At the top, 12 and 13,''  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div>the porter answered Levin's inquiry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At home?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure to be at home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>The door of No.
<p/>12 was half open, and there came out into the streak of light thick fumes of cheap, poor tobacco, and the sound of a voice, unknown to Levin; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew at once that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother was there; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) cough.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went in the door, the unknown voice was saying:  <div class="bookquote">``It all depends with how much judgment and knowledge the thing's done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Konstantin Levin looked in at the door, and saw that the speaker was a young man with an immense shock of hair, wearing a Russian jerkin, and that a pockmarked woman in a woolen gown, without collar or cuffs, was sitting on the sofa.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother was not to be seen.
<p/>Konstantin felt a sharp pang at his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) heart at the thought of the strange company in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) brother spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) life.
<p/>No one had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>), and Konstantin, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) galoshes, listened to what the gentleman in the jerkin was saying.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) was speaking of some enterprise.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, the devil flay them, the privileged classes,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) brother's voice responded, with a cough.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Masha!
<p/>get us some supper and some wine if there's any left; or else go and get some.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman rose, came out from behind the screen, and saw Konstantin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's some gentleman, Nikolay Dmitrievitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom do you want?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said the voice of Nikolay Levin, angrily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div>answered Konstantin Levin, coming forward into the light.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's  I ?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Nikolay's voice said again, still more angrily.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) could be heard getting up hurriedly, stumbling against something, and Levin saw, facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in the doorway, the big, scared eyes, and the huge, thin, stooping figure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, so familiar, and yet astonishing in its weirdness and sickliness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was even thinner than three years before, when Konstantin Levin had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) last.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was wearing a short coat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands and big bones seemed huger than ever.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hair had grown thinner, the same straight mustaches hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lips, the same eyes gazed strangely and naively at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) visitor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Kostya!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) exclaimed suddenly, recognizing his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) brother, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) eyes lit up with joy.
<p/>But the same second he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) looked round at the young man, and gave the nervous jerk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) head and neck that Konstantin knew so well, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) neckband hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>); and a quite different expression, wild, suffering, and cruel, rested on his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) emaciated face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wrote to you and Sergey Ivanovitch both that I don't know you and don't want to know you.
<p/>What is it you want?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was not at all the same as Konstantin had been fancying him (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>).
<p/>The worst and most tiresome part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) character, what made all relations with him (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) so difficult, had been forgotten by Konstantin Levin when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and now, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face, and especially that nervous twitching of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) remembered it all.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't want to see you for anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) answered timidly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've simply come to see you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's timidity obviously softened Nikolay.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) lips twitched.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, so that's it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, come in; sit down.
<p/>Like some supper?
<p/>Masha, bring supper for three.
<p/>No, stop a minute.
<p/>Do you know who this is?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) said, addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) brother, and indicating the gentleman in the jerkin: <div class="bookquote">``This is Mr. Kritsky, my friend from Kiev, a very remarkable man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s persecuted by the police, of course, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s not a scoundrel.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked round in the way he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always did at everyone in the room.
<p/>Seeing that the woman standing in the doorway was moving to go, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shouted to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute, I said.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>And with the inability to express himself, the incoherence that Konstantin knew so well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) began, with another look round at everyone, to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) brother Kritsky's story: how he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) had been expelled from the university for starting a benefit society for the poor students and Sunday schools; and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) had afterwards been a teacher in a peasant school, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) had been driven out of that too, and had afterwards been condemned for something.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're of the Kiev university?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Konstantin Levin to Kritsky, to break the awkward silence that followed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I was of Kiev,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kritsky</b></font>)</div>Kritsky replied angrily, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face darkening.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And this woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Nikolay Levin interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), pointing to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is the partner of my life, Marya Nikolaevna.
<p/>I took her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) out of a bad house,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) jerked his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) neck saying this; <div class="bookquote">``but I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) and respect her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>), and any one who wants to know me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) added, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) voice and knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brows, <div class="bookquote">``I beg to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) and respect her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>)'s just the same as my wife, just the same.
<p/>So now you know whom you've to do with.
<p/>And if you think you're lowering yourself, well, here's the floor, there's the door.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And again his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes traveled inquiringly over all of them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why I should be lowering myself, I don't understand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Masha, tell them to bring supper; three portions, spirits and wine....  No, wait a minute....  No, it doesn't matter.... Go along.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 25   <div class="bookquote">``So you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>pursued Nikolay Levin, painfully wrinkling his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) forehead and twitching.
<p/>It was obviously difficult for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to think of what to say and do.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, do you see?'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pointed to some sort of iron bars, fastened together with strings, lying in a corner of the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you see that?
<p/>That's the beginning of a new thing we're going into.
<p/>It's a productive association...''   (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div>Konstantin scarcely heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) sickly, consumptive face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) was more and more sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) could not force himself to listen to what his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) brother was telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) about the association.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) from self-contempt.
<p/>Nikolay Levin went on talking:  <div class="bookquote">``You know that capital oppresses the laborer.
<p/>The laborers with us, the peasants, bear all the burden of labor, and are so placed that however much they work they can't escape from their position of beasts of burden.
<p/>All the profits of labor, on which they might improve their position, and gain leisure for themselves, and after that education, all the surplus values are taken from them by the capitalists.
<p/>And society's so constituted that the harder they work, the greater the profit of the merchants and landowners, while they stay beasts of burden to the end.
<p/>And that state of things must be changed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) finished up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) looked questioningly at his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div>said Konstantin, looking at the patch of red that had come out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) brother's projecting cheek bones.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so we're founding a locksmiths' association, where all the production and profit and the chief instruments of production will be in common.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is the association to be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Konstantin Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the village of Vozdrem, Kazan government.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why in a village?
<p/>In the villages, I think, there is plenty of work as it is.
<p/>Why a locksmiths' association in a village?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?
<p/>Because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were, and that's why you and Sergey Ivanovitch don't like people to try and get them out of their slavery,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Nikolay Levin, exasperated by the objection.
<p/>Konstantin Levin sighed, looking meanwhile about the cheerless and dirty room.
<p/>This sigh seemed to exasperate Nikolay still more.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know your and Sergey Ivanovitch's aristocratic views.
<p/>I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) applies all the power of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) intellect to justify existing evils.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Nikolay Levin shrieked suddenly at the name of Sergey Ivanovitch.

<p/>But what's the use of talking?
<p/>There's only one thing....  What did you come to me for?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't look down on it at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div>said Konstantin Levin timidly.

 (<font color='red'><b>Marya Nikolaevna/Marya</b></font>)</div><p/>At that instant Marya Nikolaevna came back.
<p/>Nikolay Levin looked round angrily at her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) went quickly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and whispered something.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not well; I've grown irritable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Nikolay Levin, getting calmer and breathing painfully; <div class="bookquote">``and then you talk to me of Sergey Ivanovitch and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) article.

 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked Kritsky, sitting down again at the table, and moving back off half of it the scattered cigarettes, so as to clear a space.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've not read it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kritsky</b></font>)</div>Kritsky responded gloomily, obviously not desiring to enter into the conversation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Nikolay Levin, now turning with exasperation upon Kritsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I didn't see the use of wasting my time over it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but excuse me, how did you know it would be wasting your time?

<p/>But with me, it's another thing; I see through his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ideas, and I know where its weakness lies.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Everyone</b></font>)</div><p/>Everyone was mute.
<p/>Kritsky got up deliberately and reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) cap.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you have supper?

<p/>Come round tomorrow with the locksmith.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kritsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Kritsky had hardly gone out when Nikolay Levin smiled and winked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s no good either,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see, of course...''   (<font color='red'><b>Kritsky</b></font>)</div>But at that instant Kritsky, at the door, called him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)...  <div class="bookquote">``What do you want now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, and went out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in the passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been long with my brother?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brother, and at once became better humored.

<p/>For me now...everything's at an end!
<p/>I've made a mess of my life.

 (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Konstantin made haste to change the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, tell me what's going on at Pokrovskoe.

<p/>Now mind and don't alter anything in the house, but make haste and get married, and make everything as it used to be again.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But come to me now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How nicely we would arrange it!''

<p/>This timidity touched Konstantin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you want to hear my confession of faith on the subject, I tell you that in your quarrel with Sergey Ivanovitch I take neither side.

 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Nikolay shouted joyfully.

 (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Konstantin could not say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) valued it more because Nikolay was unhappy, and needed affection.
<p/>But Nikolay knew that this was just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) meant to say, and scowling he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) took up the vodka again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough, Nikolay Dmitrievitch!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marya Nikolaevna/Marya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Marya Nikolaevna, stretching out her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) plump, bare arm towards the decanter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) understands nothing?''

<p/>No one ever spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) so but the justices of the peace who tried her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) for trying to get out of a house of ill-fame.
<p/>Mercy on us, the senselessness in the world!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) cried suddenly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``These new institutions, these justices of the peace, rural councils, what hideousness it all is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) began to enlarge on his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) encounters with the new institutions.
<p/>Konstantin Levin heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and the disbelief in the sense of all public institutions, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shared with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and often expressed, was distasteful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) now from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's lips.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In another world we shall understand it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said lightly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In another world!

<p/>I don't like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scared eyes rest on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here one would think that to get out of all the baseness and the mess, one's own and other people's, would be a good thing, and yet I'm afraid of death, awfully afraid of death.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shuddered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But do drink something.
<p/>Would you like some champagne?
<p/>Or shall we go somewhere?
<p/>Let's go to the Gypsies!
<p/>Do you know I have got so fond of the Gypsies and Russian songs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) speech had begun to falter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) passed abruptly from one subject to another.
<p/>Konstantin with the help of Masha persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) not to go out anywhere, and got him (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) to bed hopelessly drunk.
<p/>Masha promised to write to Konstantin in case of need, and to persuade Nikolay Levin to go and stay with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother.
<p/>Chapter 26   In the morning Konstantin Levin left Moscow, and towards evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) reached home.
<p/>On the journey in the train he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) talked to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) neighbors about politics and the new railways, and, just as in Moscow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was overcome by a sense of confusion of ideas, dissatisfaction with himself, shame of something or other.
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) got out at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own station, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) one-eyed coachman, Ignat, with the collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) coat turned up; when, in the dim light reflected by the station fires, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own sledge, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own horses with their tails tied up, in their harness trimmed with rings and tassels; when the coachman Ignat, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) luggage, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) the village news, that the contractor had arrived, and that Pava had calved,--he (<font color='blue'><b>contractor</b></font>) felt that little by little the confusion was clearing up, and the shame and self-dissatisfaction were passing away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>contractor</b></font>) felt this at the mere sight of Ignat and the horses; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>contractor</b></font>) had put on the sheepskin brought for him (<font color='blue'><b>contractor</b></font>), had sat down wrapped up in the sledge, and had driven off pondering on the work that lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>contractor</b></font>) in the village, and staring at the side-horse, that had been his (<font color='blue'><b>contractor</b></font>) saddle-horse, past his (<font color='blue'><b>contractor</b></font>) prime now, but a spirited beast from the Don, he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) began to see what had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) in quite a different light.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) felt himself, and did not want to be any one else.
<p/>All he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) wanted now was to be better than before.
<p/>In the first place he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) resolved that from that day he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) would give up hoping for any extraordinary happiness, such as marriage must have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>), and consequently he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) would not so disdain what he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) really had.
<p/>Secondly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) would never again let himself give way to low passion, the memory of which had so tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) had been making up his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) mind to make an offer.
<p/>Then remembering his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) brother Nikolay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) resolved to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) would never allow himself to forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) would follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) up, and not lose sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>), so as to be ready to help when things should go ill with him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>).
<p/>And that would be soon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) felt.
<p/>Then, too, his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) brother's talk of communism, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) had treated so lightly at the time, now made him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) think.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) considered a revolution in economic conditions nonsense.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) always felt the injustice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) own abundance in comparison with the poverty of the peasants, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) determined that so as to feel quite in the right, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) had worked hard and lived by no means luxuriously before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) would now work still harder, and would allow himself even less luxury.
<p/>And all this seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) so easy a conquest over himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) spent the whole drive in the pleasantest daydreams.
<p/>With a resolute feeling of hope in a new, better life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) reached home before nine o'clock at night.
<p/>The snow of the little quadrangle before the house was lit up by a light in the bedroom windows of his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) old nurse, Agafea Mihalovna, who performed the duties of housekeeper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) house.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was not yet asleep.
<p/>Kouzma, waked up by her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), came sidling sleepily out onto the steps.
<p/>A setter bitch, Laska, ran out too, almost upsetting Kouzma, and whining, turned round about Levin's knees, jumping up and longing, but not daring, to put her (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>) forepaws on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) chest.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're soon back again, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Agafea Mihalovna</b></font>)</div>said Agafea Mihalovna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I got tired of it, Agafea Mihalovna.
<p/>With friends, one is well; but at home, one is better,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) answered, and went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) study.
<p/>The study was slowly lit up as the candle was brought in.
<p/>The familiar details came out: the stag's horns, the bookshelves, the looking-glass, the stove with its ventilator, which had long wanted mending, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) father's sofa, a large table, on the table an open book, a broken ash tray, a manuscript book with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) handwriting.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw all this, there came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) for an instant a doubt of the possibility of arranging the new life, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been dreaming on the road.
<p/>All these traces of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) life seemed to clutch him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``No, you're not going to get away from us, and you're not going to be different, but you're going to be the same as you've always been; with doubts, everlasting dissatisfaction with yourself, vain efforts to amend, and falls, and everlasting expectation, of a happiness which you won't get, and which isn't possible for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>This the things said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), but another voice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart was telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must not fall under the sway of the past, and that one can do anything with oneself.
<p/>And hearing that voice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went into the corner where stood his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) two heavy dumbbells, and began brandishing them like a gymnast, trying to restore his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) confident temper.
<p/>There was a creak of steps at the door.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hastily put down the dumbbells.
<p/>The bailiff came in, and said everything, thank God, was doing well; but informed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that the buckwheat in the new drying machine had been a little scorched.
<p/>This piece of news irritated Levin.
<p/>The new drying machine had been constructed and partly invented by Levin.
<p/>The bailiff had always been against the drying machine, and now it was with suppressed triumph that he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) announced that the buckwheat had been scorched.
<p/>Levin was firmly convinced that if the buckwheat had been scorched, it was only because the precautions had not been taken, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had hundreds of times given orders.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was annoyed, and reprimanded the bailiff.
<p/>But there had been an important and joyful event: Pava, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) best cow, an expensive beast, bought at a show, had calved.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kouzma, give me my sheepskin.
<p/>And you tell them to take a lantern.
<p/>I'll come and look at her (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to the bailiff.
<p/>The cowhouse for the more valuable cows was just behind the house.
<p/>Walking across the yard, passing a snowdrift by the lilac tree, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went into the cowhouse.
<p/>There was the warm, steamy smell of dung when the frozen door was opened, and the cows, astonished at the unfamiliar light of the lantern, stirred on the fresh straw.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) caught a glimpse of the broad, smooth, black and piebald back of Hollandka.
<p/>Berkoot, the bull, was lying down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ring in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lip, and seemed about to get up, but thought better of it, and only gave two snorts as they passed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Pava, a perfect beauty, huge as a hippopotamus, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) back turned to them, prevented their seeing the calf, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sniffed her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) all over.
<p/>Levin went into the pen, looked Pava over, and lifted the red and spotted calf onto her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) long, tottering legs.
<p/>Pava, uneasy, began lowing, but when Levin put the calf close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was soothed, and, sighing heavily, began licking her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) rough tongue.
<p/>The calf, fumbling, poked her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) nose under her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mother's udder, and stiffened her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tail out straight.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, bring the light, Fyodor, this way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, examining the calf.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like the mother!
<p/>though the color takes after the father; but that's nothing.
<p/>Very good.
<p/>Long and broad in the haunch.
<p/>Vassily Fedorovitch, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) splendid?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) said to the bailiff, quite forgiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) for the buckwheat under the influence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) delight in the calf.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How could she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fail to be?
<p/>Oh, Semyon the contractor came the day after you left.
<p/>You must settle with him (<font color='blue'><b>contractor</b></font>), Konstantin Dmitrievitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bailiff</b></font>)</div>said the bailiff.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did inform you about the machine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>This question was enough to take Levin back to all the details of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) work on the estate, which was on a large scale, and complicated.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went straight from the cowhouse to the counting house, and after a little conversation with the bailiff and Semyon the contractor, he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) went back to the house and straight upstairs to the drawing room.
<p/>Chapter 27   The house was big and old-fashioned, and Levin, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lived alone, had the whole house heated and used.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew that this was stupid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew that it was positively not right, and contrary to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) present new plans, but this house was a whole world to Levin.
<p/>It was the world in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) father and mother had lived and died.
<p/>They had lived just the life that to Levin seemed the ideal of perfection, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had dreamed of beginning with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) family.
<p/>Levin scarcely remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mother.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) conception of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) a sacred memory, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) future wife was bound to be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) imagination a repetition of that exquisite, holy ideal of a woman that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mother had been.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was so far from conceiving of love for woman apart from marriage that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) positively pictured to himself first the family, and only secondarily the woman who would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) a family.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ideas of marriage were, consequently, quite unlike those of the great majority of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) acquaintances, for whom getting married was one of the numerous facts of social life.
<p/>For Levin it was the chief affair of life, on which its whole happiness turned.
<p/>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to give up that.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had gone into the little drawing room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) always had tea, and had settled himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) armchair with a book, and Agafea Mihalovna had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tea, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) usual, <div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll stay a while, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>had taken a chair in the window, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that, however strange it might be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not parted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) daydreams, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not live without them.
<p/>Whether with her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), or with another, still it would be.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was reading a book, and thinking of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was reading, and stopping to listen to Agafea Mihalovna, who gossiped away without flagging, and yet with all that, all sorts of pictures of family life and work in the future rose disconnectedly before his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) imagination.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that in the depth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) soul something had been put in its place, settled down, and laid to rest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard Agafea Mihalovna talking of how Prohor had forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) duty to God, and with the money Levin had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to buy a horse, had been drinking without stopping, and had beaten his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife till he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'d half killed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) listened, and read his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) book, and recalled the whole train of ideas suggested by his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) reading.
<p/>It was Tyndall's  Treatise on Heat .
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) recalled his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own criticisms of Tyndall of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) complacent satisfaction in the cleverness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) experiments, and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lack of philosophic insight.
<p/>And suddenly there floated into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind the joyful thought: <div class="bookquote">``In two years' time I shall have two Dutch cows; Pava herself will perhaps still be alive, a dozen young daughters of Berkoot and the three others--how lovely!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) book again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, electricity and heat are the same thing; but is it possible to substitute the one quantity for the other in the equation for the solution of any problem?
<p/>No.
<p/>Well, then what of it?
<p/>The connection between all the forces of nature is felt instinctively....
<p/>It's particulary nice if Pava's daughter should be a red-spotted cow, and all the herd will take after her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and the other three, too!
<p/>Splendid!
<p/>To go out with my wife and visitors to meet the herd....  My wife says, Kostya and I looked after that calf like a child.'
<p/>`How can it interest you so much?'
<p/>says a visitor.
<p/>`Everything that interests him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), interests me.'
<p/>But who will she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) remembered what had happened at Moscow...  <div class="bookquote">``Well, there's nothing to be done....

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) head, and fell to dreaming.
<p/>Old Laska, who had not yet fully digested her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) delight at his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) return, and had run out into the yard to bark, came back wagging her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tail, and crept up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>), bringing in the scent of fresh air, put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head under his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) hand, and whined plaintively, asking to be stroked.

 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin looked intently at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), surprised at how well she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I fetch you another cup?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) cup she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went out.
<p/>Laska kept poking her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head under his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) stroked her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) promptly curled up at his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) feet, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head on a hindpaw.
<p/>And in token of all now being well and satisfactory, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mouth a little, smacked her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lips, and settling her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sticky lips more comfortably about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) old teeth, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sank into blissful repose.
<p/>Levin watched all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) movements attentively.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I'll do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to himself; <div class="bookquote">``that's what I'll do!

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 28   After the ball, early next morning, Anna Arkadyevna sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) husband a telegram that she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) was leaving Moscow the same day.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I must go, I must go'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) sister-in-law the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) plans in a tone that suggested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) had to remember so many things that there was no enumerating them: <div class="bookquote">``no, it had really better be today!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch was not dining at home, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) promised to come and see his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sister off at seven o'clock.
<p/>Kitty, too, did not come, sending a note that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had a headache.
<p/>Dolly and Anna dined alone with the children and the English governess.
<p/>Whether it was that the children were fickle, or that they had acute senses, and felt that Anna was quite different that day from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been when they had taken such a fancy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was not now interested in them,--but they had abruptly dropped their play with their aunt, and their love for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), and were quite indifferent that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was going away.
<p/>Anna was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) departure.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wrote notes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) Moscow acquaintances, put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) accounts, and packed.
<p/>Altogether Dolly fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was not in a placid state of mind, but in that worried mood, which Dolly knew well with herself, and which does not come without cause, and for the most part covers dissatisfaction with self.
<p/>After dinner, Anna went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) room to dress, and Dolly followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How queer you are today!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I?
<p/>Do you think so?
<p/>I'm not queer, but I'm nasty.
<p/>I am like that sometimes.
<p/>I keep feeling as if I could cry.
<p/>It's very stupid, but it'll pass off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna quickly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) flushed face over a tiny bag in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was packing a nightcap and some cambric handkerchiefs.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes were particularly bright, and were continually swimming with tears.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the same way I didn't want to leave Petersburg, and now I don't want to go away from here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You came here and did a good deed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, looking intently at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/>Anna looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with eyes wet with tears.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say that, Dolly.
<p/>I've done nothing, and could do nothing.
<p/>I often wonder why people are all in league to spoil me.
<p/>What have I done, and what could I do?

<p/>How happy you are, Anna!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything is clear and good in your heart.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every heart has its own  skeletons , as the English say.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no sort of  skeleton , have you?
<p/>Everything is so clear in you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna suddenly, and, unexpectedly after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tears, a sly, ironical smile curved her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lips.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s amusing, anyway, your  skeleton , and not depressing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s depressing.
<p/>Do you know why I'm going today instead of tomorrow?
<p/>It's a confession that weighs on me; I want to make it to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, letting herself drop definitely into an armchair, and looking straight into Dolly's face.
<p/>And to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) surprise Dolly saw that Anna was blushing up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ears, up to the curly black ringlets on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) neck.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>Anna went on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know why Kitty didn't come to dinner?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)'s jealous of me.
<p/>I have spoiled...I've been the cause of that ball being a torture to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) instead of a pleasure.
<p/>But truly, truly, it's not my fault, or only my fault a little bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, daintily drawling the words <div class="bookquote">``a little bit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how like Stiva you said that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dolly, laughing.
<p/>Anna was hurt.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, oh no!
<p/>I'm not Stiva,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, knitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) brows.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's why I'm telling you, just because I could never let myself doubt myself for an instant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.
<p/>But at the very moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was uttering the words, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that they were not true.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was not merely doubting herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt emotion at the thought of Vronsky, and was going away sooner than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had meant, simply to avoid meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>)...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You can't imagine how absurdly it all came about.
<p/>I only meant to be matchmaking, and all at once it turned out quite differently.
<p/>Possibly against my own will...''   (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) crimsoned and stopped.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, they feel it directly?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) side,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>Anna interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am certain it will all be forgotten, and Kitty will leave off hating me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the same, Anna, to tell you the truth, I'm not very anxious for this marriage for Kitty.
<p/>And it's better it should come to nothing, if he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>), Vronsky, is capable of falling in love with you in a single day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, heavens, that would be too silly!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna, and again a deep flush of pleasure came out on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heard the idea, that absorbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), put into words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so here I am going away, having made an enemy of Kitty, whom I liked so much!
<p/>Ah, how sweet she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) is!
<p/>But you'll make it right, Dolly?
<p/>Eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly could scarcely suppress a smile.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) loved Anna, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) enjoyed seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) too had her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) weaknesses.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An enemy?
<p/>That can't be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did so want you all to care for me, as I do for you, and now I care for you more than ever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, how silly I am today!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) handkerchief over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face and began dressing.
<p/>At the very moment of starting Stepan Arkadyevitch arrived, late, rosy and good-humored, smelling of wine and cigars.
<p/>Anna's emotionalism infected Dolly, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) sister-in-law for the last time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) whispered: <div class="bookquote">``Remember, Anna, what you've done for me--I shall never forget.
<p/>And remember that I love you, and shall always love you as my dearest friend!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tears.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You understood me, and you understand.
<p/>Good-bye, my darling!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 29   <div class="bookquote">``Come, it's all over, and thank God!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>was the first thought that came to Anna Arkadyevna, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) had said good-bye for the last time to her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) brother, who had stood blocking up the entrance to the carriage till the third bell rang.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) sat down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) lounge beside Annushka, and looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) in the twilight of the sleeping-carriage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God!
<p/>tomorrow I shall see Seryozha and Alexey Alexandrovitch, and my life will go on in the old way, all nice and as usual.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Still in the same anxious frame of mind, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) had been all that day, Anna took pleasure in arranging herself for the journey with great care.
<p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) little deft hands she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) opened and shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) little red bag, took out a cushion, laid it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knees, and carefully wrapping up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) feet, settled herself comfortably.
<p/>An invalid lady had already lain down to sleep.
<p/>Two other ladies began talking to Anna, and a stout elderly lady tucked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) feet, and made observations about the heating of the train.
<p/>Anna answered a few words, but not foreseeing any entertainment from the conversation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked Annushka to get a lamp, hooked it onto the arm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) seat, and took from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bag a paper knife and an English novel.
<p/>At first her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) reading made no progress.
<p/>The fuss and bustle were disturbing; then when the train had started, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not help listening to the noises; then the snow beating on the left window and sticking to the pane, and the sight of the muffled guard passing by, covered with snow on one side, and the conversations about the terrible snowstorm raging outside, distracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) attention.
<p/>Farther on, it was continually the same again and again: the same shaking and rattling, the same snow on the window, the same rapid transitions from steaming heat to cold, and back again to heat, the same passing glimpses of the same figures in the twilight, and the same voices, and Anna began to read and to understand what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) read.
<p/>Annushka was already dozing, the red bag on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lap, clutched by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) broad hands, in gloves, of which one was torn.
<p/>Anna Arkadyevna read and understood, but it was distasteful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) to read, that is, to follow the reflection of other people's lives.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) had too great a desire to live herself.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) read that the heroine of the novel was nursing a sick man, she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) longed to move with noiseless steps about the room of a sick man; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) read of a member of Parliament making a speech, she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) longed to be delivering the speech; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) read of how Lady Mary had ridden after the hounds, and had provoked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sister-in-law, and had surprised everyone by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) boldness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) too wished to be doing the same.
<p/>But there was no chance of doing anything; and twisting the smooth paper knife in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) little hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) forced herself to read.
<p/>The hero of the novel was already almost reaching his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) English happiness, a baronetcy and an estate, and Anna was feeling a desire to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) to the estate, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) suddenly felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>)  ought to feel ashamed, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was ashamed of the same thing.
<p/>But what had he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) to be ashamed of?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have I to be ashamed of?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked herself in injured surprise.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) laid down the book and sank against the back of the chair, tightly gripping the paper cutter in both hands.
<p/>There was nothing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went over all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) Moscow recollections.
<p/>All were good, pleasant.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) remembered the ball, remembered Vronsky and his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) face of slavish adoration, remembered all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) conduct with him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>): there was nothing shameful.
<p/>And for all that, at the same point in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) memories, the feeling of shame was intensified, as though some inner voice, just at the point when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought of Vronsky, were saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Warm, very warm, hot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to herself resolutely, shifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) seat in the lounge.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it mean?
<p/>Am I afraid to look it straight in the face?
<p/>Why, what is it?
<p/>Can it be that between me and this officer boy there exist, or can exist, any other relations than such as are common with every acquaintance?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) laughed contemptuously and took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) book again; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was definitely unable to follow what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) read.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) passed the paper knife over the window pane, then laid its smooth, cool surface to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cheek, and almost laughed aloud at the feeling of delight that all at once without cause came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt as though her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) nerves were strings being strained tighter and tighter on some sort of screwing peg.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes opening wider and wider, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fingers and toes twitching nervously, something within oppressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) breathing, while all shapes and sounds seemed in the uncertain half-light to strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with unaccustomed vividness.
<p/>Moments of doubt were continually coming upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was uncertain whether the train were going forwards or backwards, or were standing still altogether; whether it were Annushka at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) side or a stranger.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that on the arm of the chair, a fur cloak or some beast?
<p/>And what am I myself?
<p/>Myself or some other woman?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was afraid of giving way to this delirium.
<p/>But something drew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) towards it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could yield to it or resist it at will.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got up to rouse herself, and slipped off her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) plaid and the cape of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) warm dress.
<p/>For a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) regained her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) self-possession, and realized that the thin peasant who had come in wearing a long overcoat, with buttons missing from it, was the stoveheater, that he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was looking at the thermometer, that it was the wind and snow bursting in after him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) at the door; but then everything grew blurred again....  That peasant with the long waist seemed to be gnawing something on the wall, the old lady began stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) legs the whole length of the carriage, and filling it with a black cloud; then there was a fearful shrieking and banging, as though someone were being torn to pieces; then there was a blinding dazzle of red fire before her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes and a wall seemed to rise up and hide everything.
<p/>Anna felt as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) were sinking down.
<p/>But it was not terrible, but delightful.
<p/>The voice of a man muffled up and covered with snow shouted something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ear.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) got up and pulled herself together; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) realized that they had reached a station and that this was the guard.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked Annushka to hand her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) the cape she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had taken off and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) shawl, put them on and moved towards the door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you wish to get out?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annushka</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Annushka.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I want a little air.
<p/>It's very hot in here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) opened the door.
<p/>The driving snow and the wind rushed to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and struggled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) over the door.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) enjoyed the struggle.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) opened the door and went out.
<p/>The wind seemed as though lying in wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>); with gleeful whistle it tried to snatch her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) up and bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) off, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) clung to the cold door post, and holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) skirt got down onto the platform and under the shelter of the carriages.
<p/>The wind had been powerful on the steps, but on the platform, under the lee of the carriages, there was a lull.
<p/>With enjoyment she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) drew deep breaths of the frozen, snowy air, and standing near the carriage looked about the platform and the lighted station.
<p/>Chapter 30   The raging tempest rushed whistling between the wheels of the carriages, about the scaffolding, and round the corner of the station.
<p/>The carriages, posts, people, everything that was to be seen was covered with snow on one side, and was getting more and more thickly covered.
<p/>For a moment there would come a lull in the storm, but then it would swoop down again with such onslaughts that it seemed impossible to stand against it.
<p/>Meanwhile men ran to and fro, talking merrily together, their steps crackling on the platform as they continually opened and closed the big doors.
<p/>The bent shadow of a man glided by at her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) feet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) heard sounds of a hammer upon iron.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hand over that telegram!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>came an angry voice out of the stormy darkness on the other side.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This way!
<p/>No.
<p/>28!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>several different voices shouted again, and muffled figures ran by covered with snow.
<p/>Two gentlemen with lighted cigarettes passed by her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) drew one more deep breath of the fresh air, and had just put her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hand out of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) muff to take hold of the door post and get back into the carriage, when another man in a military overcoat, quite close beside her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), stepped between her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) and the flickering light of the lamp post.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) looked round, and the same instant recognized Vronsky's face.
<p/>Putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) hand to the peak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) cap, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) bowed to her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) and asked, Was there anything she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wanted?
<p/>Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) be of any service to her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) gazed rather a long while at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) without answering, and, in spite of the shadow in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was standing, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) saw, or fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) saw, both the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) face and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>It was again that expression of reverential ecstasy which had so worked upon her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) the day before.
<p/>More than once she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had told herself during the past few days, and again only a few moments before, that Vronsky was for her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) only one of the hundreds of young men, forever exactly the same, that are met everywhere, that she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) would never allow herself to bestow a thought upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>But now at the first instant of meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was seized by a feeling of joyful pride.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had no need to ask why he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had come.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) knew as certainly as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was here to be where she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know you were going.
<p/>What are you coming for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said, letting fall the hand with which she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had grasped the door post.
<p/>And irrepressible delight and eagerness shone in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I coming for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) repeated, looking straight into her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that I have come to be where you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I can't help it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment the wind, as it were, surmounting all obstacles, sent the snow flying from the carriage roofs, and clanked some sheet of iron it had torn off, while the hoarse whistle of the engine roared in front, plaintively and gloomily.
<p/>All the awfulness of the storm seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) more splendid now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had said what her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) soul longed to hear, though she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) feared it with her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) reason.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) made no answer, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) face he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) saw conflict.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, if you dislike what I said,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said humbly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had spoken courteously, deferentially, yet so firmly, so stubbornly, that for a long while she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) could make no answer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's wrong, what you say, and I beg you, if you're a good man, to forget what you've said, as I forget it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said at last.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not one word, not one gesture of yours shall I, could I, ever forget...''   (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Enough, enough!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) cried trying assiduously to give a stern expression to her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) face, into which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was gazing greedily.
<p/>And clutching at the cold door post, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) clambered up the steps and got rapidly into the corridor of the carriage.
<p/>But in the little corridor she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) paused, going over in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) imagination what had happened.
<p/>Though she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) could not recall her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own words or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) realized instinctively that the momentary conversation had brought them fearfully closer; and she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was panic-stricken and blissful at it.
<p/>After standing still a few seconds, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) went into the carriage and sat down in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) place.
<p/>The overstrained condition which had tormented her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) before did not only come back, but was intensified, and reached such a pitch that she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was afraid every minute that something would snap within her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) from the excessive tension.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) did not sleep all night.
<p/>But in that nervous tension, and in the visions that filled her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) imagination, there was nothing disagreeable or gloomy:  on the contrary there was something blissful, glowing, and exhilarating.
<p/>Towards morning Anna sank into a doze, sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) place, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) waked it was daylight and the train was near Petersburg.
<p/>At once thoughts of home, of husband and of son, and the details of that day and the following came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>At Petersburg, as soon as the train stopped and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) got out, the first person that attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) attention was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mercy!
<p/>why do his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ears look like that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) frigid and imposing figure, and especially the ears that struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) at the moment as propping up the brim of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) round hat.
<p/>Catching sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) came to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lips falling into their habitual sarcastic smile, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) big, tired eyes looking straight at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>An unpleasant sensation gripped at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) obstinate and weary glance, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had expected to see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) different.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was especially struck by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) experienced on meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>That feeling was an intimate, familiar feeling, like a consciousness of hypocrisy, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) experienced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) relations with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband.
<p/>But hitherto she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not taken note of the feeling, now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was clearly and painfully aware of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, as you see, your tender spouse, as devoted as the first year after marriage, burned with impatience to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) deliberate, high-pitched voice, and in that tone which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) almost always took with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), a tone of jeering at anyone who should say in earnest what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Seryozha quite well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And is this all the reward,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``for my ardor?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s quite well...''     (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Chapter 31   Vronsky had not even tried to sleep all that night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) armchair, looking straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) or scanning the people who got in and out.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had indeed on previous occasions struck and impressed people who did not know him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) air of unhesitating composure, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seemed now more haughty and self-possessed than ever.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looked at people as if they were things.
<p/>A nervous young man, a clerk in a law court, sitting opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), hated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for that look.
<p/>The young man asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for a light, and entered into conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and even pushed against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not a thing, but a person.
<p/>But Vronsky gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did at the lamp, and the young man made a wry face, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was losing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) self-possession under the oppression of this refusal to recognize him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a person.
<p/>Vronsky saw nothing and no one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt himself a king, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made an impression on Anna--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not yet believe that,--but because the impression she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had made on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) happiness and pride.
<p/>What would come of it all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not know, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not even think.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forces, hitherto dissipated, wasted, were centered on one thing, and bent with fearful energy on one blissful goal.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was happy at it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew only that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) the truth, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was, that all the happiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, the only meaning in life for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), now lay in seeing and hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got out of the carriage at Bologova to get some seltzer water, and caught sight of Anna, involuntarily his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first word had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) just what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was glad he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew it now and was thinking of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not sleep all night.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was back in the carriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept unceasingly going over every position in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), every word she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had uttered, and before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fancy, making his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart faint with emotion, floated pictures of a possible future.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got out of the train at Petersburg, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleepless night as keen and fresh as after a cold bath.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paused near his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) compartment, waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to get out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Once more,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to himself, smiling unconsciously, <div class="bookquote">``once more I shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) walk, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) will say something, turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head, glance, smile, maybe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caught sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband, whom the station-master was deferentially escorting through the crowd.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes!
<p/>The husband.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Only now for the first time did Vronsky realize clearly the fact that there was a person attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), a husband.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had a husband, but had hardly believed in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) existence, and only now fully believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) head and shoulders, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) legs clad in black trousers; especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw this husband calmly take her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) arm with a sense of property.
<p/>Seeing Alexey Alexandrovitch with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) Petersburg face and severely self-confident figure, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) round hat, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) rather prominent spine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and was aware of a disagreeable sensation, such as a man might feel tortured by thirst, who, on reaching a spring, should find a dog, a sheep, or a pig, who has drunk of it and muddied the water.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch's manner of walking, with a swing of the hips and flat feet, particularly annoyed Vronsky.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could recognize in no one but himself an indubitable right to love her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>).
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) was still the same, and the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) the same way, physically reviving him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), stirring him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) soul with rapture.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) German valet, who ran up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) from the second class, to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) things and go on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) himself went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw the first meeting between the husband and wife, and noted with a lover's insight the signs of slight reserve with which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) does not love him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and cannot love him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) decided to himself.
<p/>At the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was approaching Anna Arkadyevna he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) noticed too with joy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) was conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) being near, and looked round, and seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), turned again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) husband.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you passed a good night?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) asked, bowing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) husband together, and leaving it up to Alexey Alexandrovitch to accept the bow on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own account, and to recognize it or not, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) might see fit.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) answered.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) face looked weary, and there was not that play of eagerness in it, peeping out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) smile and her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) eyes; but for a single instant, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), there was a flash of something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) eyes, and although the flash died away at once, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was happy for that moment.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) husband to find out whether he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knew Vronsky.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch looked at Vronsky with displeasure, vaguely recalling who this was.
<p/>Vronsky's composure and self-confidence here struck, like a scythe against a stone, upon the cold self-confidence of Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Count Vronsky,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>We are acquainted, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch indifferently, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You set off with the mother and you return with the son,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, articulating each syllable, as though each were a separate favor he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was bestowing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're back from leave, I suppose?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, and without waiting for a reply, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) jesting tone: <div class="bookquote">``Well, were a great many tears shed at Moscow at parting?''
 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>By addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife like this he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) gave Vronsky to understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) wished to be left alone, and, turning slightly towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) hat; but Vronsky turned to Anna Arkadyevna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I may have the honor of calling on you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) weary eyes at Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Delighted,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said coldly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``On Mondays we're at home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You lay too much stress on your devotion for me to value it much,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) responded in the same jesting tone, involuntarily listening to the sound of Vronsky's steps behind them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what has it to do with me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said to herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) began asking her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband how Seryozha had got on without her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, capitally!

<p/>Chapter 32   The first person to meet Anna at home was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) dashed down the stairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), in spite of the governess's call, and with desperate joy shrieked:  <div class="bookquote">``Mother!

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) son, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) husband, aroused in Anna a feeling akin to disappointment.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) had imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) better than he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was in reality.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) had to let herself drop down to the reality to enjoy him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) really was.
<p/>But even as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was charming, with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fair curls, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) blue eyes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) plump, graceful little legs in tightly pulled-up stockings.
<p/>Anna experienced almost physical pleasure in the sensation of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) nearness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) caresses, and moral soothing, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) simple, confiding, and loving glance, and heard his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) na√Øve questions.
<p/>Anna took out the presents Dolly's children had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son what sort of little girl was Tanya at Moscow, and how Tanya could read, and even taught the other children.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, am I not so nice as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seryozha</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Seryozha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To me you're nicer than anyone in the world.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seryozha</b></font>)</div>said Seryozha, smiling.
<p/>Anna had not had time to drink her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) coffee when the Countess Lidia Ivanovna was announced.
<p/>The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a tall, stout woman, with an unhealthily sallow face and splendid, pensive black eyes.
<p/>Anna liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), but today she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) seemed to be seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) for the first time with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) defects.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, so you took the olive branch?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div><p/>inquired Countess Lidia Ivanovna, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) came into the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's all over, but it was all much less serious than we had supposed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>answered Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My  belle-soeur  is in general too hasty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div><p/>But Countess Lidia Ivanovna, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was interested in everything that did not concern her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), had a habit of never listening to what interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) interrupted Anna:  <div class="bookquote">``Yes, there's plenty of sorrow and evil in the world.
<p/>I am so worried today.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Anna, trying to suppress a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm beginning to be weary of fruitlessly championing the truth, and sometimes I'm quite unhinged by it.
<p/>The Society of the Little Sisters''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div>-LRB-this was a religiously-patriotic, philanthropic institution-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``was going splendidly, but with these gentlemen it's impossible to do anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div>added Countess Lidia Ivanovna in a tone of ironical submission to destiny.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They pounce on the idea, and distort it, and then work it out so pettily and unworthily.
<p/>Two or three people, your husband among them, understand all the importance of the thing, but the others simply drag it down.
<p/>Yesterday Pravdin wrote to me...''   (<font color='red'><b>Pravdin</b></font>)</div>Pravdin was a well-known Panslavist abroad, and Countess Lidia Ivanovna described the purport of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) letter.
<p/>Then the countess told her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) of more disagreements and intrigues against the work of the unification of the churches, and departed in haste, as she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) had that day to be at the meeting of some society and also at the Slavonic committee.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was all the same before, of course; but why was it I didn't notice it before?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna asked herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or has she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) been very much irritated today?
<p/>It's really ludicrous; her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) object is doing good; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) a Christian, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)'s always angry; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) always has enemies, and always enemies in the name of Christianity and doing good.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div><p/>After Countess Lidia Ivanovna another friend came, the wife of a chief secretary, who told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) all the news of the town.
<p/>At three o'clock she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) too went away, promising to come to dinner.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch was at the ministry.
<p/>Anna, left alone, spent the time till dinner in assisting at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son's dinner -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) dined apart from his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) parents-RRB- and in putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) things in order, and in reading and answering the notes and letters which had accumulated on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) table.
<p/>The feeling of causeless shame, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had felt on the journey, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) excitement, too, had completely vanished.
<p/>In the habitual conditions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt again resolute and irreproachable.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) recalled with wonder her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) state of mind on the previous day.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was it?
<p/>Nothing.
<p/>Vronsky said something silly, which it was easy to put a stop to, and I answered as I ought to have done.
<p/>To speak of it to my husband would be unnecessary and out of the question.
<p/>To speak of it would be to attach importance to what has no importance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) remembered how she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband of what was almost a declaration made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) at Petersburg by a young man, one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband's subordinates, and how Alexey Alexandrovitch had answered that every woman living in the world was exposed to such incidents, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had the fullest confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tact, and could never lower her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and himself by jealousy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So then there's no reason to speak of it?
<p/>And indeed, thank God, there's nothing to speak of,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told herself.
<p/>Chapter 33   Alexey Alexandrovitch came back from the meeting of the ministers at four o'clock, but as often happened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had not time to come in to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) study to see the people waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) with petitions, and to sign some papers brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) chief secretary.
<p/>At dinner time -LRB-there were always a few people dining with the Karenins-RRB- there arrived an old lady, a cousin of Alexey Alexandrovitch, the chief secretary of the department and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife, and a young man who had been recommended to Alexey Alexandrovitch for the service.
<p/>Anna went into the drawing room to receive these guests.
<p/>Precisely at five o'clock, before the bronze Peter the First clock had struck the fifth stroke, Alexey Alexandrovitch came in, wearing a white tie and evening coat with two stars, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had to go out directly after dinner.
<p/>Every minute of Alexey Alexandrovitch's life was portioned out and occupied.
<p/>And to make time to get through all that lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) every day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) adhered to the strictest punctuality.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unhasting and unresting,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) motto.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) came into the dining hall, greeted everyone, and hurriedly sat down, smiling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my solitude is over.
<p/>You wouldn't believe how uncomfortable''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) laid stress on the word  uncomfortable -RRB- <div class="bookquote">``it is to dine alone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) talked a little to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife about Moscow matters, and, with a sarcastic smile, asked her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) after Stepan Arkadyevitch; but the conversation was for the most part general, dealing with Petersburg official and public news.
<p/>After dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) spent half an hour with his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) guests, and again, with a smile, pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) wife's hand, withdrew, and drove off to the council.
<p/>Anna did not go out that evening either to the Princess Betsy Tverskaya, who, hearing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) return, had invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>), nor to the theater, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) had a box for that evening.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) did not go out principally because the dress she (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) had reckoned upon was not ready.
<p/>Altogether, Anna, on turning, after the departure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) guests, to the consideration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) attire, was very much annoyed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was generally a mistress of the art of dressing well without great expense, and before leaving Moscow she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dressmaker three dresses to transform.
<p/>The dresses had to be altered so that they could not be recognized, and they ought to have been ready three days before.
<p/>It appeared that two dresses had not been done at all, while the other one had not been altered as Anna had intended.
<p/>The dressmaker came to explain, declaring that it would be better as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had done it, and Anna was so furious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt ashamed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought of it afterwards.
<p/>To regain her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) serenity completely she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went into the nursery, and spent the whole evening with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son, put him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to bed herself, signed him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) with the cross, and tucked him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) up.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not gone out anywhere, and had spent the evening so well.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt so light-hearted and serene, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw so clearly that all that had seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) so important on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) railway journey was only one of the common trivial incidents of fashionable life, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had no reason to feel ashamed before anyone else or before herself.
<p/>Anna sat down at the hearth with an English novel and waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband.
<p/>Exactly at half-past nine she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ring, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) came into the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here you are at last!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) observed, holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand and sat down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Altogether then, I see your visit was a success,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) began telling him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) about everything from the beginning: her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) journey with Countess Vronskaya, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) arrival, the accident at the station.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) described the pity she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had felt, first for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) brother, and afterwards for Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I imagine one cannot exonerate such a man from blame, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is your brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch severely.
<p/>Anna smiled.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said that simply to show that family considerations could not prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) from expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) genuine opinion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that characteristic in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband, and liked it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad it has all ended so satisfactorily, and that you are back again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, what do they say about the new act I have got passed in the council?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna had heard nothing of this act, And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt conscience-stricken at having been able so readily to forget what was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) of such importance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, on the other hand, it has made a great sensation,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, with a complacent smile.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw that Alexey Alexandrovitch wanted to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) something pleasant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) about it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) by questions to telling it.
<p/>With the same complacent smile he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) of the ovations he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had received in consequence of the act he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had passed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was very, very glad.
<p/>It shows that at last a reasonable and steady view of the matter is becoming prevalent among us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>cream</b></font>)</div><p/>Having drunk his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) second cup of tea with cream, and bread, Alexey Alexandrovitch got up, and was going towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) study.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you've not been anywhere this evening?
<p/>You've been dull, I expect?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) answered, getting up after him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) and accompanying him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) across the room to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) study.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you reading now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just now I'm reading Duc de Lille,  Po√©sie des Enfers, ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very remarkable book.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna smiled, as people smile at the weaknesses of those they love, and, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand under his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) escorted him (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) to the door of the study.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) habit, that had grown into a necessity, of reading in the evening.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew, too, that in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) official duties, which swallowed up almost the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) considered it his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) duty to keep up with everything of note that appeared in the intellectual world.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) was really interested in books dealing with politics, philosophy, and theology, that art was utterly foreign to his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) nature; but, in spite of this, or rather, in consequence of it, Alexey Alexandrovitch never passed over anything in the world of art, but made it his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) duty to read everything.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that in politics, in philosophy, in theology, Alexey Alexandrovitch often had doubts, and made investigations; but on questions of art and poetry, and, above all, of music, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was totally devoid of understanding, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had the most distinct and decided opinions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was fond of talking about Shakespeare, Raphael, Beethoven, of the significance of new schools of poetry and music, all of which were classified by him (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) with very conspicuous consistency.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, God be with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said at the door of the study, where a shaded candle and a decanter of water were already put by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) armchair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'll write to Moscow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand, and again kissed it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All the same he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s a good man; truthful, good-hearted, and remarkable in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own line,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>Anna said to herself going back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) room, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) were defending him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to someone who had attacked him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and said that one could not love him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why is it his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ears stick out so strangely?
<p/>Or has he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hair cut?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Precisely at twelve o'clock, when Anna was still sitting at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) writing table, finishing a letter to Dolly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) heard the sound of measured steps in slippers, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, freshly washed and combed, with a book under his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) arm, came in to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's time, it's time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), with a meaning smile, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went into their bedroom.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what right had he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) like that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Anna, recalling Vronsky's glance at Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>Undressing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went into the bedroom; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face had none of the eagerness which, during her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stay in Moscow, had fairly flashed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) smile; on the contrary, now the fire seemed quenched in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), hidden somewhere far away.
<p/>Chapter 34   When Vronsky went to Moscow from Petersburg, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) large set of rooms in Morskaia to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) friend and favorite comrade Petritsky.
<p/>Petritsky was a young lieutenant, not particularly well-connected, and not merely not wealthy, but always hopelessly in debt.
<p/>Towards evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was always drunk, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had often been locked up after all sorts of ludicrous and disgraceful scandals, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was a favorite both of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) comrades and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) superior officers.
<p/>On arriving at twelve o'clock from the station at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) flat, Vronsky saw, at the outer door, a hired carriage familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>While still outside his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own door, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) rang, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) heard masculine laughter, the lisp of a feminine voice, and Petritsky's voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If that's one of the villains, don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) in!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky told the servant not to announce him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), and slipped quietly into the first room.
<p/>Baroness Shilton, a friend of Petritsky's, with a rosy little face and flaxen hair, resplendent in a lilac satin gown, and filling the whole room, like a canary, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) Parisian chatter, sat at the round table making coffee.
<p/>Petritsky, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) overcoat, and the cavalry captain Kamerovsky, in full uniform, probably just come from duty, were sitting each side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bravo!
<p/>Vronsky!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Petritsky</b></font>)</div><p/>shouted Petritsky, jumping up, scraping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) chair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our host himself!
<p/>Baroness, some coffee for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) out of the new coffee pot.
<p/>Why, we didn't expect you!
<p/>Hope you're satisfied with the ornament of your study,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) said, indicating the baroness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know each other, of course?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, with a bright smile, pressing the baroness's little hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What next!
<p/>I'm an old friend.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're home after a journey,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baroness</b></font>)</div>said the baroness, <div class="bookquote">``so I'm flying.

 (<font color='red'><b>the baroness</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're home, wherever you are, baroness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Kamerovsky?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) added, coldly shaking hands with Kamerovsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, you never know how to say such pretty things,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baroness</b></font>)</div>said the baroness, turning to Petritsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; what's that for?
<p/>After dinner I say things quite as good.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After dinner there's no credit in them?
<p/>Well, then, I'll make you some coffee, so go and wash and get ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baroness</b></font>)</div>said the baroness, sitting down again, and anxiously turning the screw in the new coffee pot.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pierre, give me the coffee,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>baroness</b></font>) said, addressing Petritsky, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>baroness</b></font>) called Pierre as a contraction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) surname, making no secret of her (<font color='blue'><b>baroness</b></font>) relations with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll put it in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baroness</b></font>)</div><p/>said the baroness suddenly, interrupting Vronsky's conversation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) comrade.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've been marrying you here.
<p/>Have you brought your wife?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, baroness.
<p/>I was born a Bohemian, and a Bohemian I shall die.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the better, so much the better.
<p/>Shake hands on it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the baroness</b></font>)</div><p/>And the baroness, detaining Vronsky, began telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>), with many jokes, about her (<font color='blue'><b>baroness</b></font>) last new plans of life, asking his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) advice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) persists in refusing to give me a divorce!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I want to begin a suit against him (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>).
<p/>What do you advise?
<p/>Kamerovsky, look after the coffee; it's boiling over.
<p/>You see, I'm engrossed with business!
<p/>I want a lawsuit, because I must have my property.
<p/>Do you understand the folly of it, that on the pretext of my being unfaithful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>baroness</b></font>) said contemptuously, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) wants to get the benefit of my fortune.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky heard with pleasure this light-hearted prattle of a pretty woman, agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) half-joking counsel, and altogether dropped at once into the tone habitual to him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) in talking to such women.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) Petersburg world all people were divided into utterly opposed classes.
<p/>One, the lower class, vulgar, stupid, and, above all, ridiculous people, who believe that one husband ought to live with the one wife whom he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has lawfully married; that a girl should be innocent, a woman modest, and a man manly, self-controlled, and strong; that one ought to bring up one's children, earn one's bread, and pay one's debts; and various similar absurdities.
<p/>This was the class of old-fashioned and ridiculous people.
<p/>But there was another class of people, the real people.
<p/>To this class they all belonged, and in it the great thing was to be elegant, generous, plucky, gay, to abandon oneself without a blush to every passion, and to laugh at everything else.
<p/>For the first moment only, Vronsky was startled after the impression of a quite different world that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) from Moscow.
<p/>But immediately as though slipping his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) feet into old slippers, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) dropped back into the light-hearted, pleasant world he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had always lived in.
<p/>The coffee was never really made, but spluttered over every one, and boiled away, doing just what was required of it--that is, providing much cause for much noise and laughter, and spoiling a costly rug and the baroness's gown.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well now, good-bye, or you'll never get washed, and I shall have on my conscience the worst sin a gentleman can commit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So at the Francais!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>and, with a rustle of her (<font color='blue'><b>baroness</b></font>) skirts, she (<font color='blue'><b>baroness</b></font>) vanished.
<p/>Kamerovsky got up too, and Vronsky, not waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to go, shook hands and went off to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dressing room.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was washing, Petritsky described to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in brief outlines his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) position, as far as it had changed since Vronsky had left Petersburg.
<p/>No money at all.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) father said he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) wouldn't give him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) any and pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) debts.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) tailor was trying to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) locked up, and another fellow, too, was threatening to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) locked up.
<p/>The colonel of the regiment had announced that if these scandals did not cease he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) would have to leave.
<p/>As for the baroness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was sick to death of her (<font color='blue'><b>baroness</b></font>), especially since she (<font color='blue'><b>baroness</b></font>)'d taken to offering continually to lend him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) money.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had found a girl--he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)'d show her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to Vronsky--a marvel, exquisite, in the strict Oriental style, <div class="bookquote">``genre of the slave Rebecca, don't you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>)'d had a row, too, with Berkoshov, and was going to send seconds to him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>), but of course it would come to nothing.
<p/>Altogether everything was supremely amusing and jolly.
<p/>And, not letting his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) comrade enter into further details of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) position, Petritsky proceeded to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) all the interesting news.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) listened to Petritsky's familiar stories in the familiar setting of the rooms he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) had spent the last three years in, Vronsky felt a delightful sense of coming back to the careless Petersburg life that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was used to.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) cried, letting down the pedal of the washing basin in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had been sousing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) healthy red neck.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) cried, at the news that Laura had flung over Fertinghof and had made up to Mileev.

<p/>Have you seen the new helmets?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am listening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>answered Vronsky, rubbing himself with a rough towel.

<p/>They see our friend standing there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Petritsky</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Petritsky mimicked how he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was standing with the helmet.-RRB-
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Grand Duchess asked him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) the helmet; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) doesn't give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>).
<p/>What do you think of that?
<p/>Well, every one's winking at him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), nodding, frowning--give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>), do!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) doesn't give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s mute as a fish.

<p/>Well, the...what's his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) name, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was...tries to take the helmet from him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)...he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) won't give it up!...

<p/>`Here, your Highness,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>), `is the new helmet.'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) turned the helmet the other side up, And--just picture it!--plop went a pear and sweetmeats out of it, two pounds of sweetmeats!...He (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>)'d been storing them up, the darling!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky burst into roars of laughter.
<p/>And long afterwards, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) was talking of other things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) broke out into his (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) healthy laugh, showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) strong, close rows of teeth, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) thought of the helmet.
<p/>Having heard all the news, Vronsky, with the assistance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) valet, got into his (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) uniform, and went off to report himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) intended, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) had done that, to drive to his (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) brother's and to Betsy's and to pay several visits with a view to beginning to go into that society where he (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) might meet Madame Karenina.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) always did in Petersburg, he (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) left home not meaning to return till late at night.
<p/>PART TWO     Chapter 1   At the end of the winter, in the Shtcherbatskys' house, a consultation was being held, which was to pronounce on the state of Kitty's health and the measures to be taken to restore her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) failing strength.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had been ill, and as spring came on she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) grew worse.
<p/>The family doctor gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) cod liver oil, then iron, then nitrate of silver, but as the first and the second and the third were alike in doing no good, and as his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) advice when spring came was to go abroad, a celebrated physician was called in.
<p/>The celebrated physician, a very handsome man, still youngish, asked to examine the patient.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) maintained, with peculiar satisfaction, it seemed, that maiden modesty is a mere relic of barbarism, and that nothing could be more natural than for a man still youngish to handle a young girl naked.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought it natural because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did it every day, and felt and thought, as it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), no harm as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did it and consequently he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) considered modesty in the girl not merely as a relic of barbarism, but also as an insult to himself.
<p/>There was nothing for it but to submit, since, although all the doctors had studied in the same school, had read the same books, and learned the same science, and though some people said this celebrated doctor was a bad doctor, in the princess's household and circle it was for some reason accepted that this celebrated doctor alone had some special knowledge, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) alone could save Kitty.
<p/>After a careful examination and sounding of the bewildered patient, dazed with shame, the celebrated doctor, having scrupulously washed his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hands, was standing in the drawing room talking to the prince.
<p/>The prince frowned and coughed, listening to the doctor.
<p/>As a man who had seen something of life, and neither a fool nor an invalid, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had no faith in medicine, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) heart was furious at the whole farce, specially as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was perhaps the only one who fully comprehended the cause of Kitty's illness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Conceited blockhead!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) listened to the celebrated doctor's chatter about his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) daughter's symptoms.
<p/>The doctor was meantime with difficulty restraining the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) contempt for this old gentleman, and with difficulty condescending to the level of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) intelligence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) perceived that it was no good talking to the old man, and that the principal person in the house was the mother.
<p/>Before her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) decided to scatter his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pearls.
<p/>At that instant the princess came into the drawing room with the family doctor.
<p/>The prince withdrew, trying not to show how ridiculous he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) thought the whole performance.
<p/>The princess was distracted, and did not know what to do.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had sinned against Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, doctor, decide our fate,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there hope?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) meant to say, but her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) lips quivered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) could not utter the question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, doctor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Immediately, princess.
<p/>I will talk it over with my colleague, and then I will have the honor of laying my opinion before you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So we had better leave you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The princess</b></font>)</div><p/>The princess went out with a sigh.
<p/>When the doctors were left alone, the family doctor began timidly explaining his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) opinion, that there was a commencement of tuberculous trouble, but...and so on.
<p/>The celebrated doctor listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), and in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sentence looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) big gold watch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But...''   (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>The family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) observations.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The commencement of the tuberculous process we are not, as you are aware, able to define; till there are cavities, there is nothing definite.
<p/>But we may suspect it.
<p/>And there are indications; malnutrition, nervous excitability, and so on.
<p/>The question stands thus: in presence of indications of tuberculous process, what is to be done to maintain nutrition?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, you know, there are always moral, spiritual causes at the back in these cases,''  (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>the family doctor permitted himself to interpolate with a subtle smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's an understood thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div>responded the celebrated physician, again glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) watch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beg pardon, is the Yausky bridge done yet, or shall I have to drive around?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>it is.
<p/>Oh, well, then I can do it in twenty minutes.
<p/>So we were saying the problem may be put thus: to maintain nutrition and to give tone to the nerves.
<p/>The one is in close connection with the other, one must attack both sides at once.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how about a tour abroad?''
 (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div><p/>asked the family doctor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no liking for foreign tours.
<p/>And take note: if there is an early stage of tuberculous process, of which we cannot be certain, a foreign tour will be of no use.
<p/>What is wanted is means of improving nutrition, and not for lowering it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>And the celebrated doctor expounded his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) plan of treatment with Soden waters, a remedy obviously prescribed primarily on the ground that they could do no harm.
<p/>The family doctor listened attentively and respectfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But in favor of foreign travel I would urge the change of habits, the removal from conditions calling up reminiscences.
<p/>And then the mother wishes it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) added.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>Well, in that case, to be sure, let them go.
<p/>Only, those German quacks are mischievous....
<p/>They ought to be persuaded.... Well, let them go then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) glanced once more at his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) watch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>time's up already,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) went to the door.
<p/>The celebrated doctor announced to the princess -LRB-a feeling of what was due from him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) dictated his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) doing so-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) ought to see the patient once more.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!
<p/>another examination!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/>cried the mother, with horror.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, only a few details, princess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come this way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/>And the mother, accompanied by the doctor, went into the drawing room to Kitty.
<p/>Wasted and flushed, with a peculiar glitter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes, left there by the agony of shame she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had been put through, Kitty stood in the middle of the room.
<p/>When the doctor came in she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) flushed crimson, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes filled with tears.
<p/>All her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) illness and treatment struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) as a thing so stupid, ludicrous even!
<p/>Doctoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) as absurd as putting together the pieces of a broken vase.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) heart was broken.
<p/>Why would they try to cure her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) with pills and powders?
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not grieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother, especially as her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother considered herself to blame.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I trouble you to sit down, princess?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>the celebrated doctor said to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sat down with a smile, facing her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), felt her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) pulse, and again began asking her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) tiresome questions.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) answered him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), and all at once got up, furious.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, doctor, but there is really no object in this.
<p/>This is the third time you've asked me the same thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The celebrated doctor did not take offense.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nervous irritability,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said to the princess, when Kitty had left the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``However, I had finished...''   (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>And the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess, as an exceptionally intelligent woman, the condition of the young princess, and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters, which were certainly harmless.
<p/>At the question: Should they go abroad?
<p/>the doctor plunged into deep meditation, as though resolving a weighty problem.
<p/>Finally his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) decision was pronounced:  they were to go abroad, but to put no faith in foreign quacks, and to apply to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) in any need.
<p/>It seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had gone.
<p/>The mother was much more cheerful when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter, and Kitty pretended to be more cheerful.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had often, almost always, to be pretending now.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, I'm quite well, mamma.
<p/>But if you want to go abroad, let's go!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, and trying to appear interested in the proposed tour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) began talking of the preparations for the journey.
<p/>Chapter 2   Soon after the doctor, Dolly had arrived.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) knew that there was to be a consultation that day, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was only just up after her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) confinement -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had another baby, a little girl, born at the end of the winter-RRB-, though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had trouble and anxiety enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tiny baby and a sick child, to come and hear Kitty's fate, which was to be decided that day.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, coming into the drawing room, without taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're all in good spirits.
<p/>Good news, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>They tried to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) what the doctor had said, but it appeared that though the doctor had talked distinctly enough and at great length, it was utterly impossible to report what he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had said.
<p/>The only point of interest was that it was settled they should go abroad.
<p/>Dolly could not help sighing.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) dearest friend, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) sister, was going away.
<p/>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) life was not a cheerful one.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) relations with Stepan Arkadyevitch after their reconciliation had become humiliating.
<p/>The union Anna had cemented turned out to be of no solid character, and family harmony was breaking down again at the same point.
<p/>There had been nothing definite, but Stepan Arkadyevitch was hardly ever at home; money, too, was hardly ever forthcoming, and Dolly was continually tortured by suspicions of infidelity, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) tried to dismiss, dreading the agonies of jealousy she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had been through already.
<p/>The first onslaught of jealousy, once lived through, could never come back again, and even the discovery of infidelities could never now affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) as it had the first time.
<p/>Such a discovery now would only mean breaking up family habits, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) let herself be deceived, despising him (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) and still more herself, for the weakness.
<p/>Besides this, the care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) large family was a constant worry to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>): first, the nursing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) young baby did not go well, then the nurse had gone away, now one of the children had fallen ill.  <div class="bookquote">``Well, how are all of you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>asked her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) mother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, mamma, we have plenty of troubles of our own.
<p/>Lili is ill, and I'm afraid it's scarlatina.
<p/>I have come here now to hear about Kitty, and then I shall shut myself up entirely, if--God forbid--it should be scarlatina.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The prince</b></font>)</div><p/>The old prince too had come in from his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) study after the doctor's departure, and after presenting his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) cheek to Dolly, and saying a few words to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) wife:  <div class="bookquote">``How have you settled it?
<p/>you're going?
<p/>Well, and what do you mean to do with me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you had better stay here, Alexander,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexander</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's as you like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, why shouldn't father come with us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be nicer for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and for us too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The prince</b></font>)</div><p/>The old prince got up and stroked Kitty's hair.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) head and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) with a forced smile.
<p/>It always seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) better than anyone in the family, though he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) did not say much about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>Being the youngest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father's favorite, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) fancied that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) love gave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) insight.
<p/>When now her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) glance met his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) blue kindly eyes looking intently at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw right through her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and understood all that was not good that was passing within her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>Reddening, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) stretched out towards him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) expecting a kiss, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hair and said:  <div class="bookquote">``These stupid chignons!
<p/>There's no getting at the real daughter.
<p/>One simply strokes the bristles of dead women.
<p/>Well, Dolinka,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) elder daughter, <div class="bookquote">``what's your young buck about, hey?''
 (<font color='red'><b>daughter hey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>answered Dolly, understanding that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) husband was meant.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s always out; I scarcely ever see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) could not resist adding with a sarcastic smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) gone into the country yet--to see about selling that forest?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s still getting ready for the journey.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>said the prince.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so am I to be getting ready for a journey too?
<p/>At your service,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) wife, sitting down.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I tell you what, Katia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) went on to his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) younger daughter, <div class="bookquote">``you must wake up one fine day and say to yourself: Why, I'm quite well, and merry, and going out again with father for an early morning walk in the frost.
<p/>Hey?''
 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>What her (<font color='blue'><b>Katia</b></font>) father said seemed simple enough, yet at these words Kitty became confused and overcome like a detected criminal.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) sees it all, he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) understands it all, and in these words he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>)'s telling me that though I'm ashamed, I must get over my shame.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not pluck up spirit to make any answer.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) tried to begin, and all at once burst into tears, and rushed out of the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``See what comes of your jokes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>the princess pounced down on her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) husband.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're always...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) began a string of reproaches.
<p/>The prince listened to the princess's scolding rather a long while without speaking, but his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) face was more and more frowning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)'s so much to be pitied, poor child, so much to be pitied, and you don't feel how it hurts her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) to hear the slightest reference to the cause of it.
<p/>Ah!
<p/>to be so mistaken in people!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>said the princess, and by the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) tone both Dolly and the prince knew she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was speaking of Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why there aren't laws against such base, dishonorable people.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I can't bear to hear you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>said the prince gloomily, getting up from his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) low chair, and seeming anxious to get away, yet stopping in the doorway.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are laws, madam, and since you've challenged me to it, I'll tell you who's to blame for it all: you and you, you and nobody else.
<p/>Laws against such young gallants there have always been, and there still are!
<p/>Yes, if there has been nothing that ought not to have been, old as I am, I'd have called him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) out to the barrier, the young dandy.
<p/>Yes, and now you physic her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) and call in these quacks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The prince</b></font>)</div><p/>The prince apparently had plenty more to say, but as soon as the princess heard his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) tone she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) subsided at once, and became penitent, as she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) always did on serious occasions.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexander, Alexander,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) whispered, moving to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexander</b></font>) and beginning to weep.
<p/>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) began to cry the prince too calmed down.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, that's enough, that's enough!
<p/>You're wretched too, I know.
<p/>It can't be helped.
<p/>There's no great harm done.
<p/>God is merciful...thanks...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, not knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was saying, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) responded to the tearful kiss of the princess that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand.
<p/>And the prince went out of the room.
<p/>Before this, as soon as Kitty went out of the room in tears, Dolly, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) motherly, family instincts, had promptly perceived that here a woman's work lay before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) prepared to do it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) hat, and, morally speaking, tucked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) sleeves and prepared for action.
<p/>While her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) mother was attacking her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) tried to restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) mother, so far as filial reverence would allow.
<p/>During the prince's outburst she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was silent; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) felt ashamed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) mother, and tender towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) father for so quickly being kind again.
<p/>But when her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) father left them she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) made ready for what was the chief thing needful--to go to Kitty and console her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd been meaning to tell you something for a long while, mamma: did you know that Levin meant to make Kitty an offer when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was here the last time?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) told Stiva so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what then?
<p/>I don't understand...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So did Kitty perhaps refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)?...
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) didn't tell you so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) has said nothing to me either of one or the other; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)'s too proud.
<p/>But I know it's all on account of the other.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) has refused Levin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wouldn't have refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) if it hadn't been for the other, I know.
<p/>And then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) has deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) so horribly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>It was too terrible for the princess to think how she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had sinned against her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) daughter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) broke out angrily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I really don't understand!
<p/>Nowadays they will all go their own way, and mothers haven't a word to say in anything, and then...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, I'll go up to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, do.
<p/>Did I tell you not to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>said her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) mother.
<p/>Chapter 3   When she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) went into Kitty's little room, a pretty, pink little room, full of knick-knacks in  vieux saxe,  as fresh, and pink, and white, and gay as Kitty herself had been two months ago, Dolly remembered how they had decorated the room the year before together, with what love and gaiety.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) heart turned cold when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) saw Kitty sitting on a low chair near the door, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes fixed immovably on a corner of the rug.
<p/>Kitty glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sister, and the cold, rather ill-tempered expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face did not change.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm just going now, and I shall have to keep in and you won't be able to come to see me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, sitting down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to talk to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty asked swiftly, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) head in dismay.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What should it be, but your trouble?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no trouble.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Kitty.
<p/>Do you suppose I could help knowing?
<p/>I know all about it.
<p/>And believe me, it's of so little consequence....  We've all been through it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty did not speak, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face had a stern expression.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)'s not worth your grieving over him (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>pursued Darya Alexandrovna, coming straight to the point.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) has treated me with contempt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, in a breaking voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk of it!
<p/>Please, don't talk of it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``But who can have told you so?
<p/>No one has said that.
<p/>I'm certain he (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was in love with you, and would still be in love with you, if it hadn't...  <div class="bookquote">``Oh, the most awful thing of all for me is this sympathizing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>shrieked Kitty, suddenly flying into a passion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) turned round on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) chair, flushed crimson, and rapidly moving her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) fingers, pinched the clasp of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) belt first with one hand and then with the other.
<p/>Dolly knew this trick her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) sister had of clenching her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) hands when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was much excited; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) knew, too, that in moments of excitement Kitty was capable of forgetting herself and saying a great deal too much, and Dolly would have soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), but it was too late.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, what is it you want to make me feel, eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Kitty quickly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That I've been in love with a man who didn't care a straw for me, and that I'm dying of love for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?
<p/>And this is said to me by my own sister, who imagines that...that...that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s sympathizing with me!...I don't want these condolences and humbug!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kitty, you're unjust.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why are you tormenting me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I...quite the contrary...I see you're unhappy...''   (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>But Kitty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) fury did not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've nothing to grieve over and be comforted about.
<p/>I am too proud ever to allow myself to care for a man who does not love me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I don't say so either....  Only one thing.
<p/>Tell me the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>said Darya Alexandrovna, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) by the hand: <div class="bookquote">``tell me, did Levin speak to you?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>The mention of Levin's name seemed to deprive Kitty of the last vestige of self-control.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) leaped up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) chair, and flinging her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) clasp on the ground, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) gesticulated rapidly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hands and said:  <div class="bookquote">``Why bring Levin in too?
<p/>I can't understand what you want to torment me for.
<p/>I've told you, and I say it again, that I have some pride, and never,  never  would I do as you're doing--go back to a man who's deceived you, who has cared for another woman.
<p/>I can't understand it!
<p/>You may, but I can't!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And saying these words she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sister, and seeing that Dolly sat silent, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) head mournfully bowed, Kitty, instead of running out of the room as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had meant to do, sat down near the door, and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) handkerchief.
<p/>The silence lasted for two minutes: Dolly was thinking of herself.
<p/>That humiliation of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was always conscious came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) with a peculiar bitterness when her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) sister reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) of it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had not looked for such cruelty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) sister, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/>But suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) heard the rustle of a skirt, and with it the sound of heart-rending, smothered sobbing, and felt arms about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) neck.
<p/>Kitty was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knees before her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolinka, I am so, so wretched!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) whispered penitently.
<p/>And the sweet face covered with tears hid itself in Darya Alexandrovna's skirt.
<p/>As though tears were the indispensable oil, without which the machinery of mutual confidence could not run smoothly between the two sisters, the sisters after their tears talked, not of what was uppermost in their minds, but, though they talked of outside matters, they understood each other.
<p/>Kitty knew that the words she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had uttered in anger about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband's infidelity and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) humiliating position had cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) poor sister to the heart, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>Dolly for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) part knew all she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had wanted to find out.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt certain that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) surmises were correct; that Kitty's misery, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) inconsolable misery, was due precisely to the fact that Levin had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) an offer and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and Vronsky had deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was fully prepared to love Levin and to detest Vronsky.
<p/>Kitty said not a word of that; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) talked of nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) spiritual condition.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to make me miserable,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, getting calmer; <div class="bookquote">``but can you understand that everything has become hateful, loathsome, coarse to me, and I myself most of all?
<p/>You can't imagine what loathsome thoughts I have about everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, whatever loathsome thoughts can you have?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Dolly, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The most utterly loathsome and coarse: I can't tell you.
<p/>It's not unhappiness, or low spirits, but much worse.
<p/>As though everything that was good in me was all hidden away, and nothing was left but the most loathsome.
<p/>Come, how am I to tell you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) went on, seeing the puzzled look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) sister's eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father began saying something to me just now....
<p/>It seems to me he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) thinks all I want is to be married.
<p/>Mother takes me to a ball: it seems to me she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) only takes me to get me married off as soon as may be, and be rid of me.
<p/>I know it's not the truth, but I can't drive away such thoughts.
<p/>Eligible suitors, as they call them--I can't bear to see them.
<p/>It seems to me they're taking stock of me and summing me up.
<p/>In old days to go anywhere in a ball dress was a simple joy to me, I admired myself; now I feel ashamed and awkward.
<p/>And then!
<p/>The doctor....  Then...''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>Kitty hesitated; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wanted to say further that ever since this change had taken place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), Stepan Arkadyevitch had become insufferably repulsive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not see him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) without the grossest and most hideous conceptions rising before her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) imagination.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, everything presents itself to me, in the coarsest, most loathsome light,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) went on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's my illness.
<p/>Perhaps it will pass off.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you mustn't think about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help it.
<p/>I'm never happy except with the children at your house.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity you can't be with me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I'm coming.
<p/>I've had scarlatina, and I'll persuade mamma to let me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty insisted on having her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) way, and went to stay at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sister's and nursed the children all through the scarlatina, for scarlatina it turned out to be.
<p/>The two sisters brought all the six children successfully through it, but Kitty was no better in health, and in Lent the Shtcherbatskys went abroad.
<p/>Chapter 4   The highest Petersburg society is essentially one: in it everyone knows everyone else, everyone even visits everyone else.
<p/>But this great set has its subdivisions.
<p/>Anna Arkadyevna Karenina had friends and close ties in three different circles of this highest society.
<p/>One circle was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband's government official set, consisting of his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) colleagues and subordinates, brought together in the most various and capricious manner, and belonging to different social strata.
<p/>Anna found it difficult now to recall the feeling of almost awe-stricken reverence which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had at first entertained for these persons.
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew all of them as people know one another in a country town; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew their habits and weaknesses, and where the shoe pinched each one of them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew their relations with one another and with the head authorities, knew who was for whom, and how each one maintained his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) position, and where they agreed and disagreed.
<p/>But the circle of political, masculine interests had never interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), in spite of countess Lidia Ivanovna's influence, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) avoided it.
<p/>Another little set with which Anna was in close relations was the one by means of which Alexey Alexandrovitch had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) career.
<p/>The center of this circle was the Countess Lidia Ivanovna.
<p/>It was a set made up of elderly, ugly, benevolent, and godly women, and clever, learned, and ambitious men.
<p/>One of the clever people belonging to the set had called it <div class="bookquote">``the conscience of Petersburg society.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch had the highest esteem for this circle, and Anna with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) special gift for getting on with everyone, had in the early days of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) life in Petersburg made friends in this circle also.
<p/>Now, since her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) return from Moscow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had come to feel this set insufferable.
<p/>It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that both she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and all of them were insincere, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt so bored and ill at ease in that world that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went to see the Countess Lidia Ivanovna as little as possible.
<p/>The third circle with which Anna had ties was preeminently the fashionable world--the world of balls, of dinners, of sumptuous dresses, the world that hung on to the court with one hand, so as to avoid sinking to the level of the demi-monde.
<p/>For the demi-monde the members of that fashionable world believed that they despised, though their tastes were not merely similar, but in fact identical.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) connection with this circle was kept up through Princess Betsy Tverskaya, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) cousin's wife, who had an income of a hundred and twenty thousand roubles, and who had taken a great fancy to Anna ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) first came out, showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) much attention, and drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) set, making fun of Countess Lidia Ivanovna's coterie.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I'm old and ugly I'll be the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>Betsy used to say; <div class="bookquote">``but for a pretty young woman like you it's early days for that house of charity.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna had at first avoided as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could Princess Tverskaya's world, because it necessitated an expenditure beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) means, and besides in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) preferred the first circle.
<p/>But since her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) visit to Moscow she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had done quite the contrary.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) avoided her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) serious-minded friends, and went out into the fashionable world.
<p/>There she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) met Vronsky, and experienced an agitating joy at those meetings.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) met Vronsky specially often at Betsy's for Betsy was a Vronsky by birth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) cousin.
<p/>Vronsky was everywhere where he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had any chance of meeting Anna, and speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) could, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) love.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) no encouragement, but every time she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) there surged up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart that same feeling of quickened life that had come upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that day in the railway carriage when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) for the first time.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was conscious herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) delight sparkled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes and curved her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lips into a smile, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not quench the expression of this delight.
<p/>At first Anna sincerely believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was displeased with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) for daring to pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) return from Moscow, on arriving at a soiree where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had expected to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), and not finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) realized distinctly from the rush of disappointment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been deceiving herself, and that this pursuit was not merely not distasteful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), but that it made the whole interest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) life.
<p/>A celebrated singer was singing for the second time, and all the fashionable world was in the theater.
<p/>Vronsky, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) cousin from his (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) stall in the front row, did not wait till the entr`acte, but went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) box.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you come to dinner?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I marvel at the second sight of lovers,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) added with a smile, so that no one but he (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) could hear; '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wasn't there .
<p/>But come after the opera.''
<p/>Vronsky looked inquiringly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) nodded.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) by a smile, and sat down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how I remember your jeers!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>continued Princess Betsy, who took a peculiar pleasure in following up this passion to a successful issue.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's become of all that?
<p/>You're caught, my dear boy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's my one desire, to be caught,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>answered Vronsky, with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) serene, good-humored smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I complain of anything it's only that I'm not caught enough, to tell the truth.
<p/>I begin to lose hope.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, whatever hope can you have?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Betsy, offended on behalf of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) friend.  ''
<p/>Enendons nous... ''  But in her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) eyes there were gleams of light that betrayed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) understood perfectly and precisely as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did what hope he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might have.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``None whatever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, laughing and showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) even rows of teeth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) added, taking an opera glass out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) hand, and proceeding to scrutinize, over her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) bare shoulder, the row of boxes facing them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I'm becoming ridiculous.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was very well aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) ran no risk of being ridiculous in the eyes of Betsy or any other fashionable people.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was very well aware that in their eyes the position of an unsuccessful lover of a girl, or of any woman free to marry, might be ridiculous.
<p/>But the position of a man pursuing a married woman, and, regardless of everything, staking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life on drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into adultery, has something fine and grand about it, and can never be ridiculous; and so it was with a proud and gay smile under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mustaches that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lowered the opera glass and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why was it you didn't come to dinner?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, admiring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must tell you about that.
<p/>I was busily employed, and doing what, do you suppose?
<p/>I'll give you a hundred guesses, a thousand...you'd never guess.
<p/>I've been reconciling a husband with a man who'd insulted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.
<p/>Yes, really!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, did you succeed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Almost.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You really must tell me about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, getting up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come to me in the next  entr`acte. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't; I'm going to the French theater.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From Nilsson?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Betsy queried in horror, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) could not herself have distinguished Nilsson's voice from any chorus girl's.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't help it.
<p/>I've an appointment there, all to do with my mission of peace.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Blessed are the peacemakers; theirs is the kingdom of heaven,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>said Betsy, vaguely recollecting she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) had heard some similar saying from someone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then, sit down, and tell me what it's all about.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) sat down again.
<p/>Chapter 5   <div class="bookquote">``This is rather indiscreet, but it's so good it's an awful temptation to tell the story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) laughing eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to mention any names.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shall guess, so much the better.''

<p/>They, of course, follow her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>They gallop at full speed.
<p/>To their amazement, the fair one alights at the entrance of the very house to which they were going.
<p/>The fair one darts upstairs to the top story.
<p/>They get a glimpse of red lips under a short veil, and exquisite little feet.''

<p/>And at dinner they inquire who lives at the top in that house.
<p/>No one knows; only their host's valet, in answer to their inquiry whether any `young ladies' are living on the top floor, answered that there were a great many of them about there.
<p/>After dinner the two young men go into their host's study, and write a letter to the unknown fair one.
<p/>They compose an ardent epistle, a declaration in fact, and they carry the letter upstairs themselves, so as to elucidate whatever might appear not perfectly intelligible in the letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They ring.

<p/>All at once a gentleman appears with whiskers like sausages, as red as a lobster, announces that there is no one living in the flat except his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wife, and sends them both about their business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and what then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the most interesting part of the story.
<p/>It appears that it's a happy couple, a government clerk and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lady.
<p/>The government clerk lodges a complaint, and I became a mediator, and such a mediator!...
<p/>I assure you Talleyrand couldn't hold a candle to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, where was the difficulty?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you shall hear....  We apologize in due form: we are in despair, we entreat forgiveness for the unfortunate misunderstanding.
<p/>The government clerk with the sausages begins to melt, but he (<font color='blue'><b>mediator</b></font>), too, desires to express his (<font color='blue'><b>mediator</b></font>) sentiments, and as soon as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>mediator</b></font>) begins to express them, he (<font color='blue'><b>mediator</b></font>) begins to get hot and say nasty things, and again I'm obliged to trot out all my diplomatic talents.
<p/>I allowed that their conduct was bad, but I urged him (<font color='blue'><b>mediator</b></font>) to take into consideration their heedlessness, their youth; then, too, the young men had only just been lunching together.
<p/>`You understand.
<p/>They regret it deeply, and beg you to overlook their misbehavior.'
<p/>The government clerk was softened once more.
<p/>'I consent, count, and am ready to overlook it; but you perceive that my wife--my wife's a respectable woman --has been exposed to the persecution, and insults, and effrontery of young upstarts, scoundrels...'  And you must understand, the young upstarts are present all the while, and I have to keep the peace between them.
<p/>Again I call out all my diplomacy, and again as soon as the thing was about at an end, our friend the government clerk gets hot and red, and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sausages stand on end with wrath, and once more I launch out into diplomatic wiles.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must tell you this story!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Betsy, laughing, to a lady who came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) box.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has been making me laugh so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,  bonne chance !''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) added, giving Vronsky one finger of the hand in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) fan, and with a shrug of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) shoulders she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) twitched down the bodice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) gown that had worked up, so as to be duly naked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) moved forward towards the footlights into the light of the gas, and the sight of all eyes.
<p/>Vronsky drove to the French theater, where he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) really had to see the colonel of his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) regiment, who never missed a single performance there.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) wanted to see him (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>), to report on the result of his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) mediation, which had occupied and amused him (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) for the last three days.
<p/>Petritsky, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) liked, was implicated in the affair, and the other culprit was a capital fellow and first-rate comrade, who had lately joined the regiment, the young Prince Kedrov.
<p/>And what was most important, the interests of the regiment were involved in it too.
<p/>Both the young men were in Vronsky's company.
<p/>The colonel of the regiment was waited upon by the government clerk, Venden, with a complaint against his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) officers, who had insulted his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) wife.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) young wife, so Venden told the story--he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) had been married half a year--was at church with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother, and suddenly overcome by indisposition, arising from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) interesting condition, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could not remain standing, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) drove home in the first sledge, a smart-looking one, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came across.
<p/>On the spot the officers set off in pursuit of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was alarmed, and feeling still more unwell, ran up the staircase home.
<p/>Venden himself, on returning from his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) office, heard a ring at their bell and voices, went out, and seeing the intoxicated officers with a letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) had turned them out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) asked for exemplary punishment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's all very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the colonel</b></font>)</div>said the colonel to Vronsky, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) had invited to come and see him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Petritsky's becoming impossible.
<p/>Not a week goes by without some scandal.
<p/>This government clerk won't let it drop, he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>)'ll go on with the thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky saw all the thanklessness of the business, and that there could be no question of a duel in it, that everything must be done to soften the government clerk, and hush the matter up.
<p/>The colonel had called in Vronsky just because he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) to be an honorable and intelligent man, and, more than all, a man who cared for the honor of the regiment.
<p/>They talked it over, and decided that Petritsky and Kedrov must go with Vronsky to Venden's to apologize.
<p/>The colonel and Vronsky were both fully aware that Vronsky's name and rank would be sure to contribute greatly to the softening of the injured husband's feelings.
<p/>And these two influences were not in fact without effect; though the result remained, as Vronsky had described, uncertain.
<p/>On reaching the French theater, Vronsky retired to the foyer with the colonel, and reported to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) success, or non-success.
<p/>The colonel, thinking it all over, made up his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) mind not to pursue the matter further, but then for his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) own satisfaction proceeded to cross-examine Vronsky about his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) interview; and it was a long while before he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) could restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) laughter, as Vronsky described how the government clerk, after subsiding for a while, would suddenly flare up again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) recalled the details, and how Vronsky, at the last half word of conciliation, skillfully maneuvered a retreat, shoving Petritsky out before him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a disgraceful story, but killing.
<p/>Kedrov really can't fight the gentleman!
<p/>Was he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) so awfully hot?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) commented, laughing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what do you say to Claire today?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>)'s marvelous,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) went on, speaking of a new French actress.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``However often you see her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>), every day she (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>)'s different.
<p/>It's only the French who can do that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 6   Princess Betsy drove home from the theater, without waiting for the end of the last act.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) had only just time to go into her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) dressing room, sprinkle her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) long, pale face with powder, rub it, set her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) dress to rights, and order tea in the big drawing room, when one after another carriages drove up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) huge house in Bolshaia Morskaia.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) guests stepped out at the wide entrance, and the stout porter, who used to read the newspapers in the mornings behind the glass door, to the edification of the passers-by, noiselessly opened the immense door, letting the visitors pass by him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) into the house.
<p/>Almost at the same instant the hostess, with freshly arranged coiffure and freshened face, walked in at one door and her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) guests at the other door of the drawing room, a large room with dark walls, downy rugs, and a brightly lighted table, gleaming with the light of candles, white cloth, silver samovar, and transparent china tea things.
<p/>The hostess sat down at the table and took off her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) gloves.
<p/>Chairs were set with the aid of footmen, moving almost imperceptibly about the room; the party settled itself, divided into two groups: one round the samovar near the hostess, the other at the opposite end of the drawing room, round the handsome wife of an ambassador, in black velvet, with sharply defined black eyebrows.
<p/>In both groups conversation wavered, as it always does, for the first few minutes, broken up by meetings, greetings, offers of tea, and as it were, feeling about for something to rest upon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s exceptionally good as an actress; one can see she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s studied Kaulbach,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ambassador</b></font>)</div>said a diplomatic attache in the group round the ambassador's wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you notice how she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fell down?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please, don't let us talk about Nilsson!
<p/>No one can possibly say anything new about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said a fat, red-faced, flaxen-headed lady, without eyebrows and chignon, wearing an old silk dress.
<p/>This was Princess Myakaya, noted for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) simplicity and the roughness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) manners, and nicknamed  enfant terrible .
<p/>Princess Myakaya, sitting in the middle between the two groups, and listening to both, took part in the conversation first of one and then of the other.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Three people have used that very phrase about Kaulbach to me today already, just as though they had made a compact about it.
<p/>And I can't see why they liked that remark so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation was cut short by this observation, and a new subject had to be thought of again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do tell me something amusing but not spiteful,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ambassador</b></font>)</div>said the ambassador's wife, a great proficient in the art of that elegant conversation called by the English,  small talk .
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) addressed the attache, who was at a loss now what to begin upon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They say that that's a difficult task, that nothing's amusing that isn't spiteful,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) began with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'll try.
<p/>Get me a subject.
<p/>It all lies in the subject.
<p/>If a subject's given me, it's easy to spin something round it.
<p/>I often think that the celebrated talkers of the last century would have found it difficult to talk cleverly now.
<p/>Everything clever is so stale...''

<p/>The conversation began amiably, but just because it was too amiable, it came to a stop again.
<p/>They had to have recourse to the sure, never-failing topic--gossip.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think there's something Louis Quinze about Tushkevitch?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) said, glancing towards a handsome, fair-haired young man, standing at the table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>)'s in the same style as the drawing room and that's why it is he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>)'s so often here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>hostess</b></font>)</div><p/>This conversation was maintained, since it rested on allusions to what could not be talked of in that room--that is to say, of the relations of Tushkevitch with their hostess.
<p/>Round the samovar and the hostess the conversation had been meanwhile vacillating in just the same way between three inevitable topics: the latest piece of public news, the theater, and scandal.
<p/>It, too, came finally to rest on the last topic, that is, ill-natured gossip.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you heard the Maltishtcheva woman--the mother, not the daughter--has ordered a costume in  diable rose  color?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!
<p/>No, that's too lovely!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder that with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sense--for she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s not a fool, you know-- that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) doesn't see how funny she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Everyone</b></font>)</div><p/>Everyone had something to say in censure or ridicule of the luckless Madame Maltishtcheva, and the conversation crackled merrily, like a burning faggot-stack.
<p/>The husband of Princess Betsy, a good-natured fat man, an ardent collector of engravings, hearing that his (<font color='blue'><b>collector</b></font>) wife had visitors, came into the drawing room before going to his (<font color='blue'><b>collector</b></font>) club.
<p/>Stepping noiselessly over the thick rugs, he (<font color='blue'><b>collector</b></font>) went up to Princess Myakaya.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you like Nilsson?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nilsson</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how can you steal upon anyone like that!
<p/>How you startled me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) responded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't talk to me about the opera; you know nothing about music.
<p/>I'd better meet you on your own ground, and talk about your majolica and engravings.
<p/>Come now, what treasure have you been buying lately at the old curiosity shops?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you like me to show you?
<p/>But you don't understand such things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do show me!
<p/>I've been learning about them at those--what's their names?...the bankers...they've some splendid engravings.
<p/>They showed them to us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, have you been at the Sch√ºtzburgs?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the hostess</b></font>)</div><p/>asked the hostess from the samovar.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,  ma chere .
<p/>They asked my husband and me to dinner, and told us the sauce at that dinner cost a hundred pounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div>Princess Myakaya said, speaking loudly, and conscious everyone was listening; <div class="bookquote">``and very nasty sauce it was, some green mess.
<p/>We had to ask them, and I made them sauce for eighteen pence, and everybody was very much pleased with it.
<p/>I can't run to hundred-pound sauces.''
 (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)'s unique!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>said the lady of the house.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marvelous!''
 (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div><p/>said someone.
<p/>The sensation produced by Princess Myakaya's speeches was always unique, and the secret of the sensation she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) produced lay in the fact that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) spoke not always appropriately, as now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) said simple things with some sense in them.
<p/>In the society in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) lived such plain statements produced the effect of the wittiest epigram.
<p/>Princess Myakaya could never see why it had that effect, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) knew it had, and took advantage of it.
<p/>As everyone had been listening while Princess Myakaya spoke, and so the conversation around the ambassador's wife had dropped, Princess Betsy tried to bring the whole party together, and turned to the ambassador's wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you really not have tea?
<p/>You should come over here by us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, we're very happy here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ambassador</b></font>)</div>the ambassador's wife responded with a smile, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went on with the conversation that had been begun.
<p/>It was a very agreeable conversation.
<p/>They were criticizing the Karenins, husband and wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna is quite changed since her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stay in Moscow.
<p/>There's something strange about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) friend.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The great change is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) brought back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) the shadow of Alexey Vronsky,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ambassador</b></font>)</div>said the ambassador's wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what of it?
<p/>There's a fable of Grimm's about a man without a shadow, a man who's lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shadow.
<p/>And that's his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) punishment for something.
<p/>I never could understand how it was a punishment.
<p/>But a woman must dislike being without a shadow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but women with a shadow usually come to a bad end,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna's friend.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bad luck to your tongue!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>said Princess Myakaya suddenly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame Karenina's a splendid woman.
<p/>I don't like her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) husband, but I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) very much.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My husband says there are few statesmen like him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in Europe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my husband tells me just the same, but I don't believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div>said Princess Myakaya.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If our husbands didn't talk to us, we should see the facts as they are.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch, to my thinking, is simply a fool.

<p/>Before, when I was told to consider him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) clever, I kept looking for his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) ability, and thought myself a fool for not seeing it; but directly I said,  he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'s a fool,  though only in a whisper, everything's explained, isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How spiteful you are today!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit.

 (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div><p/>''`No one is satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) fortune, and everyone is satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wit.'''
<p/>The attach√© repeated the French saying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just it, just it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div>Princess Myakaya turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the point is that I won't abandon Anna to your mercies.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I had no idea of blaming her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>Anna's friend said in self-defense.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If no one follows us about like a shadow, that's no proof that we've any right to blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>And having duly disposed of Anna's friend, the Princess Myakaya got up, and together with the ambassador's wife, joined the group at the table, where the conversation was dealing with the king of Prussia.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What wicked gossip were you talking over there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Betsy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``About the Karenins.
<p/>The princess gave us a sketch of Alexey Alexandrovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ambassador</b></font>)</div>said the ambassador's wife with a smile, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sat down at the table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pity we didn't hear it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>said Princess Betsy, glancing towards the door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, here you are at last!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) said, turning with a smile to Vronsky, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) came in.
<p/>Vronsky was not merely acquainted with all the persons whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was meeting here; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw them all every day; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) came in with the quiet manner with which one enters a room full of people from whom one has only just parted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do I come from?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, in answer to a question from the ambassador's wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's no help for it, I must confess.
<p/>From the  opera bouff√© .
<p/>I do believe I've seen it a hundred times, and always with fresh enjoyment.
<p/>It's exquisite!
<p/>I know it's disgraceful, but I go to sleep at the opera, and I sit out the  opera bouff√©  to the last minute, and enjoy it.

(<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) mentioned a French actress, and was going to tell something about her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>); but the ambassador's wife, with playful horror, cut him (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) short.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't tell us about that horror.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, I won't especially as everyone knows those horrors.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And we should all go to see them if it were accepted as the correct thing, like the opera,''  (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div>chimed in Princess Myakaya.
<p/>Chapter 7   Steps were heard at the door, and Princess Betsy, knowing it was Madame Karenina, glanced at Vronsky.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) was looking towards the door, and his (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) face wore a strange new expression.
<p/>Joyfully, intently, and at the same time timidly, he (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) gazed at the approaching figure, and slowly he (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) feet.
<p/>Anna walked into the drawing room.
<p/>Holding herself extremely erect, as always, looking straight before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and moving with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) swift, resolute, and light step, that distinguished her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) from all other society women, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) crossed the short space to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hostess, shook hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), smiled, and with the same smile looked around at Vronsky.
<p/>Vronsky bowed low and pushed a chair up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) acknowledged this only by a slight nod, flushed a little, and frowned.
<p/>But immediately, while rapidly greeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) acquaintances, and shaking the hands proffered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) addressed Princess Betsy:  <div class="bookquote">``I have been at Countess Lidia's, and meant to have come here earlier, but I stayed on.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation, interrupted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) coming in, flickered up again like the light of a lamp being blown out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir John!
<p/>Yes, Sir John; I've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) speaks well.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is it true the younger Vlassieva girl's to marry Topov?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's to be done?
<p/>It's a foolish old fashion that's kept up still,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the worse for those who keep up the fashion.
<p/>The only happy marriages I know are marriages of prudence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but then how often the happiness of these prudent marriages flies away like dust just because that passion turns up that they have refused to recognize,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties have sown their wild oats already.
<p/>That's like scarlatina--one has to go through it and get it over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I imagine, joking apart, that to know love, one must make mistakes and then correct them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div>said Princess Betsy.

 (<font color='red'><b>the ambassador</b></font>)</div><p/>said the ambassador's wife playfully.
<p/>''`It's never too late to mend.'''
<p/>The attach√© repeated the English proverb.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>Betsy agreed; <div class="bookquote">``one must make mistakes and correct them.
<p/>What do you think about it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) turned to Anna, who, with a faintly perceptible resolute smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) lips, was listening in silence to the conversation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, playing with the glove she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had taken off, <div class="bookquote">``I think...of so many men, so many minds, certainly so many hearts, so many kinds of love.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky was gazing at Anna, and with a fainting heart waiting for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would say.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) sighed as after a danger escaped when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) uttered these words.
<p/>Anna suddenly turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I have had a letter from Moscow.
<p/>They write me that Kitty Shtcherbatskaya's very ill.''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vronsky, knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) brows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That doesn't interest you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, it does, very much.
<p/>What was it exactly they told you, if I may know?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) questioned.
<p/>Anna got up and went to Betsy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me a cup of tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, standing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) table.
<p/>While Betsy was pouring out the tea, Vronsky went up to Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it they write to you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) repeated.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I often think men have no understanding of what's not honorable though they're always talking of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, without answering him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've wanted to tell you so a long while,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) added, and moving a few steps away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sat down at a table in a corner covered with albums.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't quite understand the meaning of your words,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said, handing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) the cup.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) glanced towards the sofa beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) instantly sat down.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have been wanting to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, not looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say that to me for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, glancing severely at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what for,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) answered boldly and joyfully, meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) glance and not dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Not he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), was confused.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That only shows you have no heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had a heart, and that was why she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What you spoke of just now was a mistake, and not love.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember that I have forbidden you to utter that word, that hateful word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, with a shudder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have long meant to tell you this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went on, looking resolutely into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) eyes, and hot all over from the burning flush on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cheeks.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come on purpose this evening, knowing I should meet you.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and was struck by a new spiritual beauty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you wish of me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said simply and seriously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to go to Moscow and ask for Kitty's forgiveness,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't wish that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was saying what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) forced herself to say, not what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wanted to say.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you love me, as you say,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``do so that I may be at peace.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) face grew radiant.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you know that you're all my life to me?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to drive you away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only don't change anything, leave everything as it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said in a shaky voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's your husband.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>At that instant Alexey Alexandrovitch did in fact walk into the room with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) calm, awkward gait.
<p/>Glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife and Vronsky, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went up to the lady of the house, and sitting down for a cup of tea, began talking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) deliberate, always audible voice, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) habitual tone of banter, ridiculing someone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your Rambouillet is in full conclave,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, looking round at all the party; <div class="bookquote">``the graces and the muses.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div><p/>But Princess Betsy could not endure that tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)-- <div class="bookquote">``sneering,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) called it, using the English word, and like a skillful hostess she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) at once brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) into a serious conversation on the subject of universal conscription.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch was immediately interested in the subject, and began seriously defending the new imperial decree against Princess Betsy, who had attacked it.
<p/>Vronsky and Anna still sat at the little table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is getting indecorous,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>whispered one lady, with an expressive glance at Madame Karenina, Vronsky, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did I tell you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna's friend.
<p/>But not only those ladies, almost everyone in the room, even the Princess Myakaya and Betsy herself, looked several times in the direction of the two who had withdrawn from the general circle, as though that were a disturbing fact.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch was the only person who did not once look in that direction, and was not diverted from the interesting discussion he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had entered upon.
<p/>Noticing the disagreeable impression that was being made on everyone, Princess Betsy slipped someone else into her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) place to listen to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and went up to Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm always amazed at the clearness and precision of your husband's language,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The most transcendental ideas seem to be within my grasp when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s speaking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna, radiant with a smile of happiness, and not understanding a word of what Betsy had said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) crossed over to the big table and took part in the general conversation.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch, after staying half an hour, went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife and suggested that they should go home together.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answered, not looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was staying to supper.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch made his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) bows and withdrew.
<p/>The fat old Tatar, Madame Karenina's coachman, was with difficulty holding one of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pair of grays, chilled with the cold and rearing at the entrance.
<p/>A footman stood opening the carriage door.
<p/>The hall porter stood holding open the great door of the house.
<p/>Anna Arkadyevna, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) quick little hand, was unfastening the lace of her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) sleeve, caught in the hook of her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) fur cloak, and with bent head listening to the words Vronsky murmured as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) escorted her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) down.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've said nothing, of course, and I ask nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was saying; <div class="bookquote">``but you know that friendship's not what I want: that there's only one happiness in life for me, that word that you dislike so...yes, love!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Love,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) repeated slowly, in an inner voice, and suddenly, at the very instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) unhooked the lace, she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Why I don't like the word is that it means too much to me, far more than you can understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) glanced into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) face.  ''
<p/>Au revoir! ''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) hand, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) rapid, springy step she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) passed by the porter and vanished into the carriage.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) glance, the touch of her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) hand, set him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) aflame.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) kissed the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) hand where she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) had touched it, and went home, happy in the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had got nearer to the attainment of his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) aims that evening than during the last two months.
<p/>Chapter 8   Alexey Alexandrovitch had seen nothing striking or improper in the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife was sitting with Vronsky at a table apart, in eager conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) about something.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) noticed that to the rest of the party this appeared something striking and improper, and for that reason it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) too to be improper.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) must speak of it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife.
<p/>On reaching home Alexey Alexandrovitch went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) study, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) usually did, seated himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) low chair, opened a book on the Papacy at the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had laid the paper-knife in it, and read till one o'clock, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) usually did.
<p/>But from time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) high forehead and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head, as though to drive away something.
<p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) usual time he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) got up and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) toilet for the night.
<p/>Anna Arkadyevna had not yet come in.
<p/>With a book under his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) arm he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went upstairs.
<p/>But this evening, instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) usual thoughts and meditations upon official details, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) thoughts were absorbed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife and something disagreeable connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>Contrary to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) usual habit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not get into bed, but fell to walking up and down the rooms with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hands clasped behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) back.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not go to bed, feeling that it was absolutely needful for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) first to think thoroughly over the position that had just arisen.
<p/>When Alexey Alexandrovitch had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) must talk to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife about it, it had seemed a very easy and simple matter.
<p/>But now, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) began to think over the question that had just presented itself, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) very complicated and difficult.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch was not jealous.
<p/>Jealousy according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) notions was an insult to one's wife, and one ought to have confidence in one's wife.
<p/>Why one ought to have confidence-- that is to say, complete conviction that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) young wife would always love him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not ask himself.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had no experience of lack of confidence, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and told himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) ought to have it.
<p/>Now, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) conviction that jealousy was a shameful feeling and that one ought to feel confidence, had not broken down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was standing face to face with something illogical and irrational, and did not know what was to be done.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch was standing face to face with life, with the possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife's loving someone other than himself, and this seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) very irrational and incomprehensible because it was life itself.
<p/>All his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) life Alexey Alexandrovitch had lived and worked in official spheres, having to do with the reflection of life.
<p/>And every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had stumbled against life itself he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had shrunk away from it.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) experienced a feeling akin to that of a man who, while calmly crossing a precipice by a bridge, should suddenly discover that the bridge is broken, and that there is a chasm below.
<p/>That chasm was life itself, the bridge that artificial life in which Alexey Alexandrovitch had lived.
<p/>For the first time the question presented itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) of the possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife's loving someone else, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was horrified at it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not undress, but walked up and down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) regular tread over the resounding parquet of the dining room, where one lamp was burning, over the carpet of the dark drawing room, in which the light was reflected on the big new portrait of himself hanging over the sofa, and across her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) boudoir, where two candles burned, lighting up the portraits of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) parents and woman friends, and the pretty knick-knacks of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) writing table, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knew so well.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) walked across her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) boudoir to the bedroom door, and turned back again.
<p/>At each turn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) walk, especially at the parquet of the lighted dining room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) halted and said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, this I must decide and put a stop to; I must express my view of it and my decision.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) turned back again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But express what--what decision?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said to himself in the drawing room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) found no reply.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) asked himself before turning into the boudoir, <div class="bookquote">``what has occurred?
<p/>Nothing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was talking a long while with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>But what of that?
<p/>Surely women in society can talk to whom they please.
<p/>And then, jealousy means lowering both myself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) told himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) boudoir; but this dictum, which had always had such weight with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) before, had now no weight and no meaning at all.
<p/>And from the bedroom door he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) turned back again; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) entered the dark drawing room some inner voice told him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) that it was not so, and that if others noticed it that showed that there was something.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said to himself again in the dining room, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I must decide and put a stop to it, and express my view of it...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And again at the turn in the drawing room he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) asked himself, <div class="bookquote">``Decide how?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And again he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) asked himself, <div class="bookquote">``What had occurred?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>and answered, <div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and recollected that jealousy was a feeling insulting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife; but again in the drawing room he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was convinced that something had happened.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) thoughts, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) body, went round a complete circle, without coming upon anything new.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) noticed this, rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) forehead, and sat down in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) boudoir.
<p/>There, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) table, with the malachite blotting case lying at the top and an unfinished letter, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) thoughts suddenly changed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) began to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), of what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was thinking and feeling.
<p/>For the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) pictured vividly to himself her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) personal life, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ideas, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) desires, and the idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could and should have a separate life of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) so alarming that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) made haste to dispel it.
<p/>It was the chasm which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was afraid to peep into.
<p/>To put himself in thought and feeling in another person's place was a spiritual exercise not natural to Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) looked on this spiritual exercise as a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the worst of it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is that just now, at the very moment when my great work is approaching completion''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was thinking of the project he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was bringing forward at the time-RRB-, ``when I stand in need of all my mental peace and all my energies, just now this stupid worry should fall foul of me.
<p/>But what's to be done?
<p/>I'm not one of those men who submit to uneasiness and worry without having the force of character to face them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must think it over, come to a decision, and put it out of my mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) said aloud.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The question of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) feelings, of what has passed and may be passing in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) soul, that's not my affair; that's the affair of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) conscience, and falls under the head of religion,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) said to himself, feeling consolation in the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had found to which division of regulating principles this new circumstance could be properly referred.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``questions as to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) feelings, and so on, are questions for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) conscience, with which I can have nothing to do.
<p/>My duty is clearly defined.
<p/>As the head of the family, I am a person bound in duty to guide her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and consequently, in part the person responsible; I am bound to point out the danger I perceive, to warn her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), even to use my authority.
<p/>I ought to speak plainly to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>And everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would say tonight to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife took clear shape in Alexey Alexandrovitch's head.
<p/>Thinking over what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) somewhat regretted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) should have to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) time and mental powers for domestic consumption, with so little to show for it, but, in spite of that, the form and contents of the speech before him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) shaped itself as clearly and distinctly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head as a ministerial report.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must say and express fully the following points: first, exposition of the value to be attached to public opinion and to decorum; secondly, exposition of religious significance of marriage; thirdly, if need be, reference to the calamity possibly ensuing to our son; fourthly, reference to the unhappiness likely to result to herself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>And, interlacing his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fingers, Alexey Alexandrovitch stretched them, and the joints of the fingers cracked.
<p/>This trick, a bad habit, the cracking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) fingers, always soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and gave precision to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) thoughts, so needful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) at this juncture.
<p/>There was the sound of a carriage driving up to the front door.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch halted in the middle of the room.
<p/>A woman's step was heard mounting the stairs.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch, ready for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) speech, stood compressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) crossed fingers, waiting to see if the crack would not come again.
<p/>One joint cracked.
<p/>Already, from the sound of light steps on the stairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was close, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) speech, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt frightened of the explanation confronting him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)...    Chapter 9   Anna came in with hanging head, playing with the tassels of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hood.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face was brilliant and glowing; but this glow was not one of brightness; it suggested the fearful glow of a conflagration in the midst of a dark night.
<p/>On seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband, Anna raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head and smiled, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had just waked up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not in bed?
<p/>What a wonder!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, letting fall her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hood, and without stopping, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went on into the dressing room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's late, Alexey Alexandrovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had gone through the doorway.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna, it's necessary for me to have a talk with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, wonderingly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) came out from behind the door of the dressing room, and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what is it?
<p/>What about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked, sitting down.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let's talk, if it's so necessary.
<p/>But it would be better to get to sleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna said what came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lips, and marveled, hearing herself, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own capacity for lying.
<p/>How simple and natural were her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) words, and how likely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was simply sleepy!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt herself clad in an impenetrable armor of falsehood.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that some unseen force had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) aid and was supporting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna, I must warn you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) began.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Warn me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) so simply, so brightly, that anyone who did not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not have noticed anything unnatural, either in the sound or the sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) words.
<p/>But to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), knowing that whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went to bed five minutes later than usual, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) noticed it, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the reason; to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), knowing that every joy, every pleasure and pain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) communicated to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) at once; to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), now to see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not care to notice his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) state of mind, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not care to say a word about herself, meant a great deal.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw that the inmost recesses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soul, that had always hitherto lain open before him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), were closed against him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>More than that, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tone that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was not even perturbed at that, but as it were said straight out to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's shut up, and so it must be, and will be in future.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) experienced a feeling such as a man might have, returning home and finding his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own house locked up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But perhaps the key may yet be found,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>thought Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to warn you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talked about in society.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) talked and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Your</b></font>) laughing eyes, which frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) now with their impenetrable look, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) talked, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt all the uselessness and idleness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're always like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Your</b></font>) answered, as though completely misapprehending him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had said only taking in the last phrase.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One time you don't like my being dull, and another time you don't like my being lively.
<p/>I wasn't dull.
<p/>Does that offend you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch shivered, and bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hands to make the joints crack.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please, don't do that, I do so dislike it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Your</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna, is this you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Alexey Alexandrovitch, quietly making an effort over himself, and restraining the motion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) fingers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is it all about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, with such genuine and droll wonder.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want of me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch paused, and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) forehead and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw that instead of doing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had intended--that is to say, warning his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world--he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had unconsciously become agitated over what was the affair of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) conscience, and was struggling against the barrier he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) fancied between them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is what I meant to say to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went on coldly and composedly, <div class="bookquote">``and I beg you to listen to it.
<p/>I consider jealousy, as you know, a humiliating and degrading feeling, and I shall never allow myself to be influenced by it; but there are certain rules of decorum which cannot be disregarded with impunity.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I positively don't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, shrugging her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) shoulders--<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) doesn't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face was ugly and forbidding, as Anna had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stopped, and bending her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head back and on one side, began with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) rapid hand taking out her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hairpins.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm listening to what's to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, calmly and ironically; <div class="bookquote">``and indeed I listen with interest, for I should like to understand what's the matter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) spoke, and marveled at the confident, calm, and natural tone in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was speaking, and the choice of the words she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) used.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To enter into all the details of your feelings I have no right, and besides, I regard that as useless and even harmful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>began Alexey Alexandrovitch.

<p/>Your feelings are an affair of your own conscience; but I am in duty bound to you, to myself, and to God, to point out to you your duties.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna, for God's sake don't speak like that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said gently.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I am mistaken, but believe me, what I say, I say as much for myself as for you.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>For an instant her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face fell, and the mocking gleam in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes died away; but the word love threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) into revolt again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought:  <div class="bookquote">``Love?
<p/>Can he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) love?
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hadn't heard there was such a thing as love, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would never have used the word.

<p/>In that case, I beg you to forgive me.
<p/>But if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest foundation for them, then I beg you to think a little, and if your heart prompts you, to speak out to me...''   (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch was unconsciously saying something utterly unlike what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had prepared.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to say.
<p/>And besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said hurriedly, with difficulty repressing a smile, <div class="bookquote">``it's really time to be in bed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed, and, without saying more, went into the bedroom.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) came into the bedroom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was already in bed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) lips were sternly compressed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes looked away from her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
<p/>Anna got into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bed, and lay expecting every minute that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would begin to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) both feared his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) speaking and wished for it.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was silent.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) waited for a long while without moving, and had forgotten about him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought of that other; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pictured him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and felt how her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heard an even, tranquil snore.
<p/>For the first instant Alexey Alexandrovitch seemed, as it were, appalled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own snoring, and ceased; but after an interval of two breathings the snore sounded again, with a new tranquil rhythm.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's late, it's late,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) whispered with a smile.
<p/>A long while she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lay, not moving, with open eyes, whose brilliance she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) almost fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could herself see in the darkness.
<p/>Chapter 10   From that time a new life began for Alexey Alexandrovitch and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife.
<p/>Nothing special happened.
<p/>Anna went out into society, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had always done, was particularly often at Princess Betsy's, and met Vronsky everywhere.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch saw this, but could do nothing.
<p/>All his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) efforts to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) into open discussion she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) confronted with a barrier which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not penetrate, made up of a sort of amused perplexity.
<p/>Outwardly everything was the same, but their inner relations were completely changed.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch, a man of great power in the world of politics, felt himself helpless in this.
<p/>Like an ox with head bent, submissively he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) awaited the blow which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt was lifted over him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) began to think about it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) must try once more, that by kindness, tenderness, and persuasion there was still hope of saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), of bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) back to herself, and every day he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) made ready to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>But every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) began talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt that the spirit of evil and deceit, which had taken possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), had possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) too, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) in a tone quite unlike that in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had meant to talk.
<p/>Involuntarily he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) habitual tone of jeering at anyone who should say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was saying.
<p/>And in that tone it was impossible to say what needed to be said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 11   That which for Vronsky had been almost a whole year the one absorbing desire of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) life, replacing all his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) old desires; that which for Anna had been an impossible, terrible, and even for that reason more entrancing dream of bliss, that desire had been fulfilled.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), pale, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) lower jaw quivering, and besought her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to be calm, not knowing how or why.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna!
<p/>Anna!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said with a choking voice, <div class="bookquote">``Anna, for pity's sake!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But the louder he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) spoke, the lower she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) once proud and gay, now shame-stricken head, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bowed down and sank from the sofa where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was sitting, down on the floor, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) feet; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would have fallen on the carpet if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had not held her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My God!
<p/>Forgive me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, sobbing, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bosom.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt so sinful, so guilty, that nothing was left her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) but to humiliate herself and beg forgiveness; and as now there was no one in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) life but him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) prayer for forgiveness.
<p/>Looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had a physical sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) humiliation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could say nothing more.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt what a murderer must feel, when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sees the body he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has robbed of life.
<p/>That body, robbed by him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) of life, was their love, the first stage of their love.
<p/>There was something awful and revolting in the memory of what had been bought at this fearful price of shame.
<p/>Shame at their spiritual nakedness crushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and infected him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>But in spite of all the murderer's horror before the body of his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) victim, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) must hack it to pieces, hide the body, must use what he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) has gained by his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) murder.
<p/>And with fury, as it were with passion, the murderer falls on the body, and drags it and hacks at it; so he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face and shoulders with kisses.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) hand, and did not stir.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, these kisses--that is what has been bought by this shame.
<p/>Yes, and one hand, which will always be mine--the hand of my accomplice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lifted up that hand and kissed it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) sank on his (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) knees and tried to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hid it, and said nothing.
<p/>At last, as though making an effort over herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) got up and pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) away.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face was still as beautiful, but it was only the more pitiful for that.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All is over,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I have nothing but you.
<p/>Remember that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can never forget what is my whole life.
<p/>For one instant of this happiness...''   (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Happiness!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said with horror and loathing and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) horror unconsciously infected him (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For pity's sake, not a word, not a word more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) rose quickly and moved away from him (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word more,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) repeated, and with a look of chill despair, incomprehensible to him (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) parted from him (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that at that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not put into words the sense of shame, of rapture, and of horror at this stepping into a new life, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not want to speak of it, to vulgarize this feeling by inappropriate words.
<p/>But later too, and the next day and the third day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) still found no words in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could express the complexity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) feelings; indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not even find thoughts in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could clearly think out all that was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soul.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to herself: <div class="bookquote">``No, just now I can't think of it, later on, when I am calmer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>But this calm for thought never came; every time the thought rose of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had done and what would happen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ought to do, a horror came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) drove those thoughts away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Later, later,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``when I am calmer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But in dreams, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had no control over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thoughts, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) position presented itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in all its hideous nakedness.
<p/>One dream haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) almost every night.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dreamed that both were her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husbands at once, that both were lavishing caresses on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch was weeping, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hands, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``How happy we are now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>And Alexey Vronsky was there too, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) too was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was marveling that it had once seemed impossible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), was explaining to them, laughing, that this was ever so much simpler, and that now both of them were happy and contented.
<p/>But this dream weighed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) like a nightmare, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) awoke from it in terror.
<p/>Chapter 12   In the early days after his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) return from Moscow, whenever Levin shuddered and grew red, remembering the disgrace of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) rejection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to himself:  <div class="bookquote">``This was just how I used to shudder and blush, thinking myself utterly lost, when I was plucked in physics and did not get my remove; and how I thought myself utterly ruined after I had mismanaged that affair of my sister's that was entrusted to me.
<p/>And yet, now that years have passed, I recall it and wonder that it could distress me so much.
<p/>It will be the same thing too with this trouble.
<p/>Time will go by and I shall not mind about this either.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But three months had passed and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had not left off minding about it; and it was as painful for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to think of it as it had been those first days.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could not be at peace because after dreaming so long of family life, and feeling himself so ripe for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was still not married, and was further than ever from marriage.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was painfully conscious himself, as were all about him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), that at his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) years it is not well for man to be alone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) remembered how before starting for Moscow he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had once said to his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cowman Nikolay, a simple-hearted peasant, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) liked talking to:  <div class="bookquote">``Well, Nikolay!
<p/>I mean to get married,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and how Nikolay had promptly answered, as of a matter on which there could be no possible doubt: <div class="bookquote">``And high time too, Konstantin Demitrievitch.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>But marriage had now become further off than ever.
<p/>The place was taken, and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) tried to imagine any of the girls he (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) knew in that place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) felt that it was utterly impossible.
<p/>Moreover, the recollection of the rejection and the part he (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) had played in the affair tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) with shame.
<p/>However often he (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) told himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) was in no wise to blame in it, that recollection, like other humiliating reminiscences of a similar kind, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) twinge and blush.
<p/>There had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) past, as in every man's, actions, recognized by him (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) as bad, for which his (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) conscience ought to have tormented him (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>); but the memory of these evil actions was far from causing him (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) so much suffering as those trivial but humiliating reminiscences.
<p/>These wounds never healed.
<p/>And with these memories was now ranged his (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) rejection and the pitiful position in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) must have appeared to others that evening.
<p/>But time and work did their part.
<p/>Bitter memories were more and more covered up by the incidents--paltry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) eyes, but really important--of his (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) country life.
<p/>Every week he (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) thought less often of Kitty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) was impatiently looking forward to the news that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was married, or just going to be married, hoping that such news would, like having a tooth out, completely cure him (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>).
<p/>Meanwhile spring came on, beautiful and kindly, without the delays and treacheries of spring,--one of those rare springs in which plants, beasts, and man rejoice alike.
<p/>This lovely spring roused Levin still more, and strengthened him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) resolution of renouncing all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) past and building up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lonely life firmly and independently.
<p/>Though many of the plans with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had returned to the country had not been carried out, still his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) most important resolution--that of purity--had been kept by him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was free from that shame, which had usually harassed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) after a fall; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could look everyone straight in the face.
<p/>In February he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had received a letter from Marya Nikolaevna telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother Nikolay's health was getting worse, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would not take advice, and in consequence of this letter Levin went to Moscow to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's and succeeded in persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to see a doctor and to go to a watering-place abroad.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) succeeded so well in persuading his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, and in lending him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) money for the journey without irritating him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was satisfied with himself in that matter.
<p/>In addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) farming, which called for special attention in spring, and in addition to reading, Levin had begun that winter a work on agriculture, the plan of which turned on taking into account the character of the laborer on the land as one of the unalterable data of the question, like the climate and the soil, and consequently deducing all the principles of scientific culture, not simply from the data of soil and climate, but from the data of soil, climate, and a certain unalterable character of the laborer.
<p/>Thus, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) solitude, or in consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) solitude, his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) life was exceedingly full.
<p/>Only rarely he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) suffered from an unsatisfied desire to communicate his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) stray ideas to someone besides Agafea Mihalovna.
<p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>Mihalovna</b></font>) indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) not infrequently fell into discussion upon physics, the theory of agriculture, and especially philosophy; philosophy was Agafea Mihalovna's favorite subject.
<p/>Spring was slow in unfolding.
<p/>For the last few weeks it had been steadily fine frosty weather.
<p/>In the daytime it thawed in the sun, but at night there were even seven degrees of frost.
<p/>There was such a frozen surface on the snow that they drove the wagons anywhere off the roads.
<p/>Easter came in the snow.
<p/>Then all of a sudden, on Easter Monday, a warm wind sprang up, storm clouds swooped down, and for three days and three nights the warm, driving rain fell in streams.
<p/>On Thursday the wind dropped, and a thick gray fog brooded over the land as though hiding the mysteries of the transformations that were being wrought in nature.
<p/>Behind the fog there was the flowing of water, the cracking and floating of ice, the swift rush of turbid, foaming torrents; and on the following Monday, in the evening, the fog parted, the storm clouds split up into little curling crests of cloud, the sky cleared, and the real spring had come.
<p/>In the morning the sun rose brilliant and quickly wore away the thin layer of ice that covered the water, and all the warm air was quivering with the steam that rose up from the quickened earth.
<p/>The old grass looked greener, and the young grass thrust up its tiny blades; the buds of the guelder-rose and of the currant and the sticky birch-buds were swollen with sap, and an exploring bee was humming about the golden blossoms that studded the willow.
<p/>Larks trilled unseen above the velvety green fields and the ice-covered stubble-land; peewits wailed over the low lands and marshes flooded by the pools; cranes and wild geese flew high across the sky uttering their spring calls.
<p/>The cattle, bald in patches where the new hair had not grown yet, lowed in the pastures; the bowlegged lambs frisked round their bleating mothers.
<p/>Nimble children ran about the drying paths, covered with the prints of bare feet.
<p/>There was a merry chatter of peasant women over their linen at the pond, and the ring of axes in the yard, where the peasants were repairing ploughs and harrows.
<p/>The real spring had come.
<p/>Chapter 13   Levin put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) big boots, and, for the first time, a cloth jacket, instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fur cloak, and went out to look after his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) farm, stepping over streams of water that flashed in the sunshine and dazzled his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes, and treading one minute on ice and the next into sticky mud.
<p/>Spring is the time of plans and projects.
<p/>And, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) came out into the farmyard, Levin, like a tree in spring that knows not what form will be taken by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned in its swelling buds, hardly knew what undertakings he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was going to begin upon now in the farm work that was so dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was full of the most splendid plans and projects.
<p/>First of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went to the cattle.
<p/>The cows had been let out into their paddock, and their smooth sides were already shining with their new, sleek, spring coats; they basked in the sunshine and lowed to go to the meadow.
<p/>Levin gazed admiringly at the cows he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew so intimately to the minutest detail of their condition, and gave orders for them to be driven out into the meadow, and the calves to be let into the paddock.
<p/>The herdsman ran gaily to get ready for the meadow.
<p/>The cowherd girls, picking up their petticoats, ran splashing through the mud with bare legs, still white, not yet brown from the sun, waving brush wood in their hands, chasing the calves that frolicked in the mirth of spring.
<p/>After admiring the young ones of that year, who were particularly fine--the early calves were the size of a peasant's cow, and Pava's daughter, at three months old, was as big as a yearling-- Levin gave orders for a trough to be brought out and for them to be fed in the paddock.
<p/>But it appeared that as the paddock had not been used during the winter, the hurdles made in the autumn for it were broken.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sent for the carpenter, who, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) orders, ought to have been at work at the thrashing machine.
<p/>But it appeared that the carpenter was repairing the harrows, which ought to have been repaired before Lent.
<p/>This was very annoying to Levin.
<p/>It was annoying to come upon that everlasting slovenliness in the farm work against which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been striving with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) might for so many years.
<p/>The hurdles, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ascertained, being not wanted in winter, had been carried to the cart-horses' stable; and there broken, as they were of light construction, only meant for feeding calves.
<p/>Moreover, it was apparent also that the harrows and all the agricultural implements, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had directed to be looked over and repaired in the winter, for which very purpose he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had hired three carpenters, had not been put into repair, and the harrows were being repaired when they ought to have been harrowing the field.
<p/>Levin sent for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bailiff, but immediately went off himself to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>The bailiff, beaming all over, like everyone that day, in a sheepskin bordered with astrachan, came out of the barn, twisting a bit of straw in his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) hands.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why isn't the carpenter at the thrashing machine?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I meant to tell you yesterday, the harrows want repairing.
<p/>Here it's time they got to work in the fields.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what were they doing in the winter, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what did you want the carpenter for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are the hurdles for the calves' paddock?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ordered them to be got ready.
<p/>What would you have with those peasants!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the bailiff</b></font>)</div><p/>said the bailiff, with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not those peasants but this bailiff!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, getting angry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what do I keep you for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) cried.
<p/>But, bethinking himself that this would not help matters, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stopped short in the middle of a sentence, and merely sighed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what do you say?
<p/>Can sowing begin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) asked, after a pause.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Behind Turkin tomorrow or the next day they might begin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the clover?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've sent Vassily and Mishka; they're sowing.
<p/>Only I don't know if they'll manage to get through; it's so slushy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How many acres?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About fifteen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not sow all?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Levin.
<p/>That they were only sowing the clover on fifteen acres, not on all the forty-five, was still more annoying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Clover, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew, both from books and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own experience, never did well except when it was sown as early as possible, almost in the snow.
<p/>And yet Levin could never get this done.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no one to send.
<p/>What would you have with such a set of peasants?
<p/>Three haven't turned up.
<p/>And there's Semyon...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, you should have taken some men from the thatching.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so I have, as it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are the peasants, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five are making comp√¥te''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>-LRB-which meant compost-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``four are shifting the oats for fear of a touch of mildew, Konstantin Dmitrievitch.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin knew very well that <div class="bookquote">``a touch of mildew''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>meant that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) English seed oats were already ruined.
<p/>Again they had not done as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had ordered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, but I told you during Lent to put in pipes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) cried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't put yourself out; we shall get it all done in time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand angrily, went into the granary to glance at the oats, and then to the stable.
<p/>The oats were not yet spoiled.
<p/>But the peasants were carrying the oats in spades when they might simply let them slide down into the lower granary; and arranging for this to be done, and taking two workmen from there for sowing clover, Levin got over his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) vexation with the bailiff.
<p/>Indeed, it was such a lovely day that one could not be angry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ignat!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) called to the coachman, who, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sleeves tucked up, was washing the carriage wheels, <div class="bookquote">``saddle me...''   (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Which, sir?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let it be Kolpik.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>While they were saddling his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) horse, Levin again called up the bailiff, who was hanging about in sight, to make it up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and began talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) about the spring operations before them, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) plans for the farm.
<p/>The wagons were to begin carting manure earlier, so as to get all done before the early mowing.
<p/>And the ploughing of the further land to go on without a break so as to let it ripen lying fallow.
<p/>And the mowing to be all done by hired labor, not on half-profits.
<p/>The bailiff listened attentively, and obviously made an effort to approve of his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) employer's projects.
<p/>But still he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) had that look Levin knew so well that always irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), a look of hopelessness and despondency.
<p/>That look said:  <div class="bookquote">``That's all very well, but as God wills.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing mortified Levin so much as that tone.
<p/>But it was the tone common to all the bailiffs he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had ever had.
<p/>They had all taken up that attitude to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) plans, and so now he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not angered by it, but mortified, and felt all the more roused to struggle against this, as it seemed, elemental force continually ranged against him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could find no other expression than <div class="bookquote">``as God wills.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If we can manage it, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bailiff</b></font>)</div>said the bailiff.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why ever shouldn't you manage it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We positively must have another fifteen laborers.
<p/>And they don't turn up.
<p/>There were some here today asking seventy roubles for the summer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin was silent.
<p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was brought face to face with that opposing force.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew that however much they tried, they could not hire more than forty--thirty-seven perhaps or thirty-eight-- laborers for a reasonable sum.
<p/>Some forty had been taken on, and there were no more.
<p/>But still he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not help struggling against it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Send to Sury, to Tchefirovka; if they don't come we must look for them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'll send, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vassily/Vassily Fedorovitch</b></font>)</div>said Vassily Fedorovitch despondently.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But there are the horses, too, they're not good for much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll get some more.
<p/>I know, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin added laughing, <div class="bookquote">``you always want to do with as little and as poor quality as possible; but this year I'm not going to let you have things your own way.
<p/>I'll see to everything myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I don't think you take much rest as it is.
<p/>It cheers us up to work under the master's eye...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So they're sowing clover behind the Birch Dale?
<p/>I'll go and have a look at them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dale</b></font>) said, getting on to the little bay cob, Kolpik, who was led up by the coachman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't get across the streams, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>the coachman shouted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, I'll go by the forest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>And Levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out into the open country, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) good little horse, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) long inactivity, stepping out gallantly, snorting over the pools, and asking, as it were, for guidance.
<p/>If Levin had felt happy before in the cattle pens and farmyard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt happier yet in the open country.
<p/>Swaying rhythmically with the ambling paces of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) good little cob, drinking in the warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) rode through his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) forest over the crumbling, wasted snow, still left in parts, and covered with dissolving tracks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) rejoiced over every tree, with the moss reviving on its bark and the buds swelling on its shoots.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) came out of the forest, in the immense plain before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) grass fields stretched in an unbroken carpet of green, without one bare place or swamp, only spotted here and there in the hollows with patches of melting snow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not put out of temper even by the sight of the peasants' horses and colts trampling down his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) young grass -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) told a peasant he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) met to drive them out-RRB-, nor by the sarcastic and stupid reply of the peasant Ipat, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) met on the way, and asked, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Ipat, shall we soon be sowing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must get the ploughing done first, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Ipat.
<p/>The further he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) rode, the happier he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) became, and plans for the land rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) mind each better than the last; to plant all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) fields with hedges along the southern borders, so that the snow should not lie under them; to divide them up into six fields of arable and three of pasture and hay; to build a cattle yard at the further end of the estate, and to dig a pond and to construct movable pens for the cattle as a means of manuring the land.
<p/>And then eight hundred acres of wheat, three hundred of potatoes, and four hundred of clover, and not one acre exhausted.
<p/>Absorbed in such dreams, carefully keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) horse by the hedges, so as not to trample his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) young crops, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) rode up to the laborers who had been sent to sow clover.
<p/>A cart with the seed in it was standing, not at the edge, but in the middle of the crop, and the winter corn had been torn up by the wheels and trampled by the horse.
<p/>Both the laborers were sitting in the hedge, probably smoking a pipe together.
<p/>The earth in the cart, with which the seed was mixed, was not crushed to powder, but crusted together or adhering in clods.
<p/>Seeing the master, the laborer, Vassily, went towards the cart, while Mishka set to work sowing.
<p/>This was not as it should be, but with the laborers Levin seldom lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) temper.
<p/>When Vassily came up, Levin told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to lead the horse to the hedge.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right, sir, it'll spring up again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vassily/Vassily Fedorovitch</b></font>)</div>responded Vassily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't argue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, <div class="bookquote">``but do as you're told.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vassily/Vassily Fedorovitch</b></font>)</div>answered Vassily, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took the horse's head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a sowing, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) said, hesitating; <div class="bookquote">``first rate.
<p/>Only it's a work to get about!
<p/>You drag a ton of earth on your shoes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is it you have earth that's not sifted?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we crumble it up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vassily/Vassily Fedorovitch</b></font>)</div>answered Vassily, taking up some seed and rolling the earth in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) palms.
<p/>Vassily was not to blame for their having filled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) cart with unsifted earth, but still it was annoying.
<p/>Levin had more than once already tried a way he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew for stifling his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) anger, and turning all that seemed dark right again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tried that way now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) watched how Mishka strode along, swinging the huge clods of earth that clung to each foot; and getting off his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took the sieve from Vassily and started sowing himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did you stop?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vassily/Vassily Fedorovitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Vassily pointed to the mark with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) foot, and Levin went forward as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could, scattering the seed on the land.
<p/>Walking was as difficult as on a bog, and by the time Levin had ended the row he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was in a great heat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stopped and gave up the sieve to Vassily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, master, when summer's here, mind you don't scold me for these rows,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vassily/Vassily Fedorovitch</b></font>)</div>said Vassily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin cheerily, already feeling the effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) method.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you'll see in the summer time.
<p/>It'll look different.
<p/>Look you where I sowed last spring.
<p/>How I did work at it!
<p/>I do my best, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, d'ye see, as I would for my own father.
<p/>I don't like bad work myself, nor would I let another man do it.
<p/>What's good for the master's good for us too.
<p/>To look out yonder now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vassily/Vassily Fedorovitch</b></font>)</div>said Vassily, pointing, <div class="bookquote">``it does one's heart good.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vassily/Vassily Fedorovitch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a lovely spring, Vassily.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's a spring such as the old men don't remember the like of.
<p/>I was up home; an old man up there has sown wheat too, about an acre of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was saying you wouldn't know it from rye.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been sowing wheat long?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, sir, it was you taught us the year before last.
<p/>You gave me two measures.
<p/>We sold about eight bushels and sowed a rood.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mind you crumble up the clods,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, going towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) horse, <div class="bookquote">``and keep an eye on Mishka.
<p/>And if there's a good crop you shall have half a rouble for every acre.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humbly thankful.
<p/>We are very well content, sir, as it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin got on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) horse and rode towards the field where was last year's clover, and the one which was ploughed ready for the spring corn.
<p/>The crop of clover coming up in the stubble was magnificent.
<p/>It had survived everything, and stood up vividly green through the broken stalks of last year's wheat.
<p/>The horse sank in up to the pasterns, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drew each hoof with a sucking sound out of the half-thawed ground.
<p/>Over the ploughland riding was utterly impossible; the horse could only keep a foothold where there was ice, and in the thawing furrows he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sank deep in at each step.
<p/>The ploughland was in splendid condition; in a couple of days it would be fit for harrowing and sowing.
<p/>Everything was capital, everything was cheering.
<p/>Levin rode back across the streams, hoping the water would have gone down.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did in fact get across, and startled two ducks.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There must be snipe too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought, and just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) reached the turning homewards he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) met the forest keeper, who confirmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) theory about the snipe.
<p/>Levin went home at a trot, so as to have time to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dinner and get his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun ready for the evening.
<p/>Chapter 14   As he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) rode up to the house in the happiest frame of mind, Levin heard the bell ring at the side of the principal entrance of the house.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's someone from the railway station,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``just the time to be here from the Moscow train...Who could it be?
<p/>What if it's brother Nikolay?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) did say:  `Maybe I'll go to the waters, or maybe I'll come down to you.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) felt dismayed and vexed for the first minute, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) brother Nikolay's presence should come to disturb his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) happy mood of spring.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) felt ashamed of the feeling, and at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) opened, as it were, the arms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) soul, and with a softened feeling of joy and expectation, now he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) hoped with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) heart that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) brother.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) pricked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) horse, and riding out from behind the acacias he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) saw a hired three-horse sledge from the railway station, and a gentleman in a fur coat.
<p/>It was not his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if it were only some nice person one could talk to a little!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>cried Levin joyfully, flinging up both his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a delightful visitor!
<p/>Ah, how glad I am to see you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shouted, recognizing Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall find out for certain whether she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s married, or when she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s going to be married,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought.
<p/>And on that delicious spring day he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did not hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) at all.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you didn't expect me, eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting out of the sledge, splashed with mud on the bridge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) nose, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) cheek, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyebrows, but radiant with health and good spirits.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come to see you in the first place,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, embracing and kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to have some stand-shooting second, and to sell the forest at Ergushovo third.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Delightful!
<p/>What a spring we're having!
<p/>How ever did you get along in a sledge?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a cart it would have been worse still, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>answered the driver, who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm very, very glad to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, with a genuine smile of childlike delight.
<p/>Levin led his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) friend to the room set apart for visitors, where Stepan Arkadyevitch's things were carried also--a bag, a gun in a case, a satchel for cigars.
<p/>Leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) there to wash and change his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) clothes, Levin went off to the counting house to speak about the ploughing and clover.
<p/>Agafea Mihalovna, always very anxious for the credit of the house, met him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in the hall with inquiries about dinner.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do just as you like, only let it be as soon as possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, and went to the bailiff.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) came back, Stepan Arkadyevitch, washed and combed, came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) room with a beaming smile, and they went upstairs together.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am glad I managed to get away to you!
<p/>Now I shall understand what the mysterious business is that you are always absorbed in here.
<p/>No, really, I envy you.
<p/>What a house, how nice it all is!
<p/>So bright, so cheerful!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, forgetting that it was not always spring and fine weather like that day.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And your nurse is simply charming!
<p/>A pretty maid in an apron might be even more agreeable, perhaps; but for your severe monastic style it does very well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch told him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) many interesting pieces of news; especially interesting to Levin was the news that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, Sergey Ivanovitch, was intending to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) a visit in the summer.
<p/>Not one word did Stepan Arkadyevitch say in reference to Kitty and the Shtcherbatskys; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) merely gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) greetings from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife.
<p/>Levin was grateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) delicacy and was very glad of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) visitor.
<p/>As always happened with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) during his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) solitude, a mass of ideas and feelings had been accumulating within him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not communicate to those about him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) poured out upon Stepan Arkadyevitch his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) poetic joy in the spring, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) failures and plans for the land, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thoughts and criticisms on the books he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been reading, and the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own book, the basis of which really was, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was unaware of it himself, a criticism of all the old books on agriculture.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch, always charming, understanding everything at the slightest reference, was particularly charming on this visit, and Levin noticed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) a special tenderness, as it were, and a new tone of respect that flattered him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>The efforts of Agafea Mihalovna and the cook, that the dinner should be particularly good, only ended in the two famished friends attacking the preliminary course, eating a great deal of bread and butter, salt goose and salted mushrooms, and in Levin's finally ordering the soup to be served without the accompaniment of little pies, with which the cook had particularly meant to impress their visitor.
<p/>But though Stepan Arkadyevitch was accustomed to very different dinners, he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) thought everything excellent: the herb brandy, and the bread, and the butter, and above all the salt goose and the mushrooms, and the nettle soup, and the chicken in white sauce, and the white Crimean wine-- everything was superb and delicious.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Splendid, splendid!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) said, lighting a fat cigar after the roast.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel as if, coming to you, I had landed on a peaceful shore after the noise and jolting of a steamer.
<p/>And so you maintain that the laborer himself is an element to be studied and to regulate the choice of methods in agriculture.
<p/>Of course, I'm an ignorant outsider; but I should fancy theory and its application will have its influence on the laborer too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but wait a bit.
<p/>I'm not talking of political economy, I'm talking of the science of agriculture.
<p/>It ought to be like the natural sciences, and to observe given phenomena and the laborer in his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) economic, ethnographical...''   (<font color='red'><b>Agafea Mihalovna</b></font>)</div>At that instant Agafea Mihalovna came in with jam.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Agafea Mihalovna,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, kissing the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) plump fingers, <div class="bookquote">``what salt goose, what herb brandy!...What do you think, isn't it time to start, Kostya?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) added.
<p/>Levin looked out of the window at the sun sinking behind the bare tree-tops of the forest.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kouzma, get ready the trap,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ran downstairs.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch, going down, carefully took the canvas cover off his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) varnished gun case with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own hands, and opening it, began to get ready his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) expensive new-fashioned gun.
<p/>Kouzma, who already scented a big tip, never left Stepan Arkadyevitch's side, and put on him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) both his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stockings and boots, a task which Stepan Arkadyevitch readily left him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kostya, give orders that if the merchant Ryabinin comes...I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) to come today, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>)'s to be brought in and to wait for me...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, do you mean to say you're selling the forest to Ryabinin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.
<p/>Do you know him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure I do.
<p/>I have had to do business with him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>), `positively and conclusively.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Positively and conclusively''  (<font color='red'><b>the merchant</b></font>)</div>were the merchant's favorite words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's wonderfully funny the way he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) talks.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) knows where her (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) master's going!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) added, patting Laska, who hung about Levin, whining and licking his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) boots, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun.
<p/>The trap was already at the steps when they went out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told them to bring the trap round; or would you rather walk?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, we'd better drive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting into the trap.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sat down, tucked the tiger-skin rug round him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and lighted a cigar.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is it you don't smoke?
<p/>A cigar is a sort of thing, not exactly a pleasure, but the crown and outward sign of pleasure.
<p/>Come, this is life!
<p/>How splendid it is!
<p/>This is how I should like to live!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, who prevents you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you're a lucky man!
<p/>You've got everything you like.
<p/>You like horses--and you have them; dogs--you have them; shooting-- you have it; farming--you have it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps because I rejoice in what I have, and don't fret for what I haven't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, thinking of Kitty.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch comprehended, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), but said nothing.
<p/>Levin was grateful to Oblonsky for noticing, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) never-failing tact, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dreaded conversation about the Shtcherbatskys, and so saying nothing about them.
<p/>But now Levin was longing to find out what was tormenting him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) so, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not the courage to begin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, tell me how things are going with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, bethinking himself that it was not nice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to think only of himself.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch's eyes sparkled merrily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't admit, I know, that one can be fond of new rolls when one has had one's rations of bread--to your mind it's a crime; but I don't count life as life without love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, taking Levin's question his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to do?
<p/>I'm made that way.
<p/>And really, one does so little harm to anyone, and gives oneself so much pleasure...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What!
<p/>is there something new, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>queried Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my boy, there is!
<p/>There, do you see, you know the type of Ossian's women....  Women, such as one sees in dreams....  Well, these women are sometimes to be met in reality...and these women are terrible.
<p/>Woman, don't you know, is such a subject that however much you study it, it's always perfectly new.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, it would be better not to study it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.
<p/>Some mathematician has said that enjoyment lies in the search for truth, not in the finding it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin listened in silence, and in spite of all the efforts he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) made, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not in the least enter into the feelings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) friend and understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sentiments and the charm of studying such women.
<p/>Chapter 15   The place fixed on for the stand-shooting was not far above a stream in a little aspen copse.
<p/>On reaching the copse, Levin got out of the trap and led Oblonsky to a corner of a mossy, swampy glade, already quite free from snow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went back himself to a double birch tree on the other side, and leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun on the fork of a dead lower branch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) full overcoat, fastened his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) belt again, and worked his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arms to see if they were free.
<p/>Gray old Laska, who had followed them, sat down warily opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) and pricked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ears.
<p/>The sun was setting behind a thick forest, and in the glow of sunset the birch trees, dotted about in the aspen copse, stood out clearly with their hanging twigs, and their buds swollen almost to bursting.
<p/>From the thickest parts of the copse, where the snow still remained, came the faint sound of narrow winding threads of water running away.
<p/>Tiny birds twittered, and now and then fluttered from tree to tree.
<p/>In the pauses of complete stillness there came the rustle of last year's leaves, stirred by the thawing of the earth and the growth of the grass.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Imagine!
<p/>One can hear and see the grass growing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin said to himself, noticing a wet, slate-colored aspen leaf moving beside a blade of young grass.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stood, listened, and gazed sometimes down at the wet mossy ground, sometimes at Laska listening all alert, sometimes at the sea of bare tree tops that stretched on the slope below him (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>), sometimes at the darkening sky, covered with white streaks of cloud.
<p/>A hawk flew high over a forest far away with slow sweep of its wings; another flew with exactly the same motion in the same direction and vanished.
<p/>The birds twittered more and more loudly and busily in the thicket.
<p/>An owl hooted not far off, and Laska, starting, stepped cautiously a few steps forward, and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) head on one side, began to listen intently.
<p/>Beyond the stream was heard the cuckoo.
<p/>Twice she (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) uttered her (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) usual cuckoo call, and then gave a hoarse, hurried call and broke down.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Imagine!
<p/>the cuckoo already!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, coming out from behind a bush.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin, reluctantly breaking the stillness with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) voice, which sounded disagreeable to himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now it's coming!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch's figure again went behind the bush, and Levin saw nothing but the bright flash of a match, followed by the red glow and blue smoke of a cigarette.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tchk!
<p/>tchk!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>came the snapping sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch cocking his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that cry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Oblonsky, drawing Levin's attention to a prolonged cry, as though a colt were whinnying in a high voice, in play.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't you know it?
<p/>That's the hare.
<p/>But enough talking!
<p/>Listen, it's flying!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>almost shrieked Levin, cocking his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun.
<p/>They heard a shrill whistle in the distance, and in the exact time, so well known to the sportsman, two seconds later-- another, a third, and after the third whistle the hoarse, guttural cry could be heard.
<p/>Levin looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to right and to left, and there, just facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) against the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoots of the aspens, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw the flying bird.
<p/>It was flying straight towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>); the guttural cry, like the even tearing of some strong stuff, sounded close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ear; the long beak and neck of the bird could be seen, and at the very instant when Levin was taking aim, behind the bush where Oblonsky stood, there was a flash of red lightning: the bird dropped like an arrow, and darted upwards again.
<p/>Again came the red flash and the sound of a blow, and fluttering its wings as though trying to keep up in the air, the bird halted, stopped still an instant, and fell with a heavy splash on the slushy ground.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I have missed it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch, who could not see for the smoke.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here it is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, pointing to Laska, who with one ear raised, wagging the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shaggy tail, came slowly back as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would prolong the pleasure, and as it were smiling, brought the dead bird to her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) master.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm glad you were successful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, who, at the same time, had a sense of envy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not succeeded in shooting the snipe.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a bad shot from the right barrel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>responded Stepan Arkadyevitch, loading his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sh...it's flying!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The shrill whistles rapidly following one another were heard again.
<p/>Two snipe, playing and chasing one another, and only whistling, not crying, flew straight at the very heads of the sportsmen.
<p/>There was the report of four shots, and like swallows the snipe turned swift somersaults in the air and vanished from sight.
<p/>The stand-shooting was capital.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch shot two more birds and Levin two, of which one was not found.
<p/>It began to get dark.
<p/>Venus, bright and silvery, shone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) soft light low down in the west behind the birch trees, and high up in the east twinkled the red lights of Arcturus.
<p/>Over his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head Levin made out the stars of the Great Bear and lost them again.
<p/>The snipe had ceased flying; but Levin resolved to stay a little longer, till Venus, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw below a branch of birch, should be above it, and the stars of the Great Bear should be perfectly plain.
<p/>Venus had risen above the branch, and the ear of the Great Bear with its shaft was now all plainly visible against the dark blue sky, yet still he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) waited.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it time to go home?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>It was quite still now in the copse, and not a bird was stirring.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's stay a little while,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``As you like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were standing now about fifteen paces from one another.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stiva!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin unexpectedly; <div class="bookquote">``how is it you don't tell me whether your sister-in-law's married yet, or when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>)'s going to be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin felt so resolute and serene that no answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fancied, could affect him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had never dreamed of what Stepan Arkadyevitch replied.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>)'s never thought of being married, and isn't thinking of it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>)'s very ill, and the doctors have sent her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) abroad.
<p/>They're positively afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) may not live.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very ill?
<p/>What is wrong with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>)?
<p/>How has she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>)...?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Laska</b></font>)</div><p/>While they were saying this, Laska, with ears pricked up, was looking upwards at the sky, and reproachfully at them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have chosen a time to talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) was thinking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's on the wing....
<p/>Here it is, yes, it is.
<p/>They'll miss it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laska</b></font>)</div>thought Laska.
<p/>But at that very instant both suddenly heard a shrill whistle which, as it were, smote on their ears, and both suddenly seized their guns and two flashes gleamed, and two gangs sounded at the very same instant.
<p/>The snipe flying high above instantly folded its wings and fell into a thicket, bending down the delicate shoots.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Splendid!
<p/>Together!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Levin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ran with Laska into the thicket to look for the snipe.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, what was it that was unpleasant?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wondered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Kitty's ill....  Well, it can't be helped; I'm very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)'s found it!
<p/>Isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) a clever thing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, taking the warm bird from Laska's mouth and packing it into the almost full game bag.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got it, Stiva!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) shouted.
<p/>Chapter 16   On the way home Levin asked all details of Kitty's illness and the Shtcherbatskys' plans, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would have been ashamed to admit it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was pleased at what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was pleased that there was still hope, and still more pleased that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) should be suffering who had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) suffer so much.
<p/>But when Stepan Arkadyevitch began to speak of the causes of Kitty's illness, and mentioned Vronsky's name, Levin cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) short.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no right whatever to know family matters, and, to tell the truth, no interest in them either.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled hardly perceptibly, catching the instantaneous change he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew so well in Levin's face, which had become as gloomy as it had been bright a minute before.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you quite settled about the forest with Ryabinin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's settled.
<p/>The price is magnificent; thirty-eight thousand.
<p/>Eight straight away, and the rest in six years.
<p/>I've been bothering about it for ever so long.
<p/>No one would give more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you've as good as given away your forest for nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin gloomily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean for nothing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a good-humored smile, knowing that nothing would be right in Levin's eyes now.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because the forest is worth at least a hundred and fifty roubles the acre,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, these farmers!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch playfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your tone of contempt for us poor townsfolk!...
<p/>But when it comes to business, we do it better than anyone.
<p/>I assure you I have reckoned it all out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and the forest is fetching a very good price--so much so that I'm afraid of this fellow's crying off, in fact.
<p/>You know it's not `timber,'''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, hoping by this distinction to convince Levin completely of the unfairness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) doubts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it won't run to more than twenty-five yards of fagots per acre, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s giving me at the rate of seventy roubles the acre.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin smiled contemptuously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``that fashion not only in him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), but in all city people, who, after being twice in ten years in the country, pick up two or three phrases and use them in season and out of season, firmly persuaded that they know all about it.

<p/>Timber, run to so many yards the acre. '
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) says those words without understanding them himself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't attempt to teach you what you write about in your office,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and if need arose, I should come to you to ask about it.
<p/>But you're so positive you know all the lore of the forest.
<p/>It's difficult.
<p/>Have you counted the trees?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How count the trees?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing, still trying to draw his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) friend out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ill-temper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Count the sands of the sea, number the stars.
<p/>Some higher power might do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, the higher power of Ryabinin can.
<p/>Not a single merchant ever buys a forest without counting the trees, unless they get it given them for nothing, as you're doing now.
<p/>I know your forest.
<p/>I go there every year shooting, and your forest's worth a hundred and fifty roubles an acre paid down, while he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>)'s giving you sixty by installments.
<p/>So that in fact you're making him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) a present of thirty thousand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, don't let your imagination run away with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch piteously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why was it none would give it, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, because he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) has an understanding with the merchants; he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>)'s bought them off.
<p/>I've had to do with all of them; I know them.
<p/>They're not merchants, you know: they're speculators.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) wouldn't look at a bargain that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) ten, fifteen per cent profit, but holds back to buy a rouble's worth for twenty kopecks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, enough of it!
<p/>You're out of temper.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the least,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin gloomily, as they drove up to the house.
<p/>At the steps there stood a trap tightly covered with iron and leather, with a sleek horse tightly harnessed with broad collar-straps.
<p/>In the trap sat the chubby, tightly belted clerk who served Ryabinin as coachman.
<p/>Ryabinin himself was already in the house, and met the friends in the hall.
<p/>Ryabinin was a tall, thinnish, middle-aged man, with mustache and a projecting clean-shaven chin, and prominent muddy-looking eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dressed in a long-skirted blue coat, with buttons below the waist at the back, and wore high boots wrinkled over the ankles and straight over the calf, with big galoshes drawn over them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handkerchief, and wrapping round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat, which sat extremely well as it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) greeted them with a smile, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand to Stepan Arkadyevitch, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to catch something.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So here you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's capital.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not venture to disregard your excellency's commands, though the road was extremely bad.
<p/>I positively walked the whole way, but I am here at my time.
<p/>Konstantin Dmitrievitch, my respects'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) turned to Levin, trying to seize his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) hand too.
<p/>But Levin, scowling, made as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not notice his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand, and took out the snipe.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your honors have been diverting yourselves with the chase?
<p/>What kind of bird may it be, pray?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ryabinin</b></font>)</div><p/>added Ryabinin, looking contemptuously at the snipe: <div class="bookquote">``a great delicacy, I suppose.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ryabinin</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head disapprovingly, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had grave doubts whether this game were worth the candle.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you like to go into my study?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin said in French to Stepan Arkadyevitch, scowling morosely.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go into my study; you can talk there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite so, where you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ryabinin</b></font>)</div>said Ryabinin with contemptuous dignity, as though wishing to make it felt that others might be in difficulties as to how to behave, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could never be in any difficulty about anything.
<p/>On entering the study Ryabinin looked about, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) habit was, as though seeking the holy picture, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had found it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not cross himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scanned the bookcases and bookshelves, and with the same dubious air with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had regarded the snipe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) smiled contemptuously and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head disapprovingly, as though by no means willing to allow that this game were worth the candle.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, have you brought the money?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Oblonsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't trouble about the money.
<p/>I've come to see you to talk it over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is there to talk over?
<p/>But do sit down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind if I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ryabinin</b></font>)</div>said Ryabinin, sitting down and leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) elbows on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) chair in a position of the intensest discomfort to himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must knock it down a bit, prince.
<p/>It would be too bad.
<p/>The money is ready conclusively to the last farthing.
<p/>As to paying the money down, there'll be no hitch there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin, who had meanwhile been putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun away in the cupboard, was just going out of the door, but catching the merchant's words, he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) stopped.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you've got the forest for nothing as it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) came to me too late, or I'd have fixed the price for him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ryabinin</b></font>)</div><p/>Ryabinin got up, and in silence, with a smile, he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) looked Levin down and up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very close about money is Konstantin Dmitrievitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) said with a smile, turning to Stepan Arkadyevitch; <div class="bookquote">``there's positively no dealing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>).
<p/>I was bargaining for some wheat of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>), and a pretty price I offered too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I give you my goods for nothing?

<p/>We are just talking things over like gentlemen.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) excellency's asking too much for the forest.
<p/>I can't make both ends meet over it.
<p/>I must ask for a little concession.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But is the thing settled between you or not?
<p/>If it's settled, it's useless haggling; but if it's not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, <div class="bookquote">``I'll buy the forest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>The smile vanished at once from Ryabinin's face.
<p/>A hawklike, greedy, cruel expression was left upon it.
<p/>With rapid, bony fingers he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) unbuttoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) coat, revealing a shirt, bronze waistcoat buttons, and a watch chain, and quickly pulled out a fat old pocketbook.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here you are, the forest is mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, crossing himself quickly, and holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take the money; it's my forest.
<p/>That's Ryabinin's way of doing business; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) doesn't haggle over every half-penny,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) added, scowling and waving the pocketbook.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't be in a hurry if I were you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, really,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div>said Oblonsky in surprise.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've given my word, you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin went out of the room, slamming the door.

<p/>And as to the profits, why, I must make what God gives.
<p/>In God's name.
<p/>If you would kindly sign the title-deed...''   (<font color='red'><b>the merchant</b></font>)</div>Within an hour the merchant, stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) big overcoat neatly down, and hooking up his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) jacket, with the agreement in his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) pocket, seated himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) tightly covered trap, and drove homewards.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ugh, these gentlefolks!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) said to the clerk.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>responded the clerk, handing him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) the reins and buttoning the leather apron.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can congratulate you on the purchase, Mihail Ignatitch?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well...''     (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>Chapter 17   Stepan Arkadyevitch went upstairs with his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) pocket bulging with notes, which the merchant had paid him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) for three months in advance.
<p/>The business of the forest was over, the money in his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) pocket; their shooting had been excellent, and Stepan Arkadyevitch was in the happiest frame of mind, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) felt specially anxious to dissipate the ill-humor that had come upon Levin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wanted to finish the day at supper as pleasantly as it had been begun.
<p/>Levin certainly was out of humor, and in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) desire to be affectionate and cordial to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) charming visitor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not control his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mood.
<p/>The intoxication of the news that Kitty was not married had gradually begun to work upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Kitty was not married, but ill, and ill from love for a man who had slighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>This slight, as it were, rebounded upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Vronsky had slighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had slighted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Levin.
<p/>Consequently Vronsky had the right to despise Levin, and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) enemy.
<p/>But all this Levin did not think out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) vaguely felt that there was something in it insulting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not angry now at what had disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fell foul of everything that presented itself.
<p/>The stupid sale of the forest, the fraud practiced upon Oblonsky and concluded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) house, exasperated him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, finished?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, meeting Stepan Arkadyevitch upstairs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you like supper?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I wouldn't say no to it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am out of temper, and do you know why?
<p/>Because--excuse me--of your stupid sale...''   (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>Stepan Arkadyevitch frowned good-humoredly, like one who feels himself teased and attacked for no fault of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, enough about it!''

<p/>You'll say again that I'm a reactionist, or some other terrible word; but all the same it does annoy and anger me to see on all sides the impoverishing of the nobility to which I belong, and, in spite of the amalgamation of classes, I'm glad to belong.
<p/>And their impoverishment is not due to extravagance--that would be nothing; living in good style --that's the proper thing for noblemen; it's only the nobles who know how to do it.
<p/>Now the peasants about us buy land, and I don't mind that.
<p/>The gentleman does nothing, while the peasant works and supplants the idle man.
<p/>That's as it ought to be.
<p/>And I'm very glad for the peasant.
<p/>But I do mind seeing the process of impoverishment from a sort of--I don't know what to call it-- innocence.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the electric light,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.
<p/>Oh, and where's Vronsky now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) asked suddenly, laying down the soap.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vronsky?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, checking his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) yawn; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s in Petersburg.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) left soon after you did, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s not once been in Moscow since.
<p/>And do you know, Kostya, I'll tell you the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) went on, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) elbow on the table, and propping on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) hand his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) handsome ruddy face, in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) moist, good-natured, sleepy eyes shone like stars.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's your own fault.
<p/>You took fright at the sight of your rival.

<p/>I told you at the time that...''   (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) yawned inwardly, without opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) mouth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) know, or doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>), that I did make an offer?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin wondered, gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there's something humbugging, diplomatic in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was blushing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looked Stepan Arkadyevitch straight in the face without speaking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If there was anything on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) side at the time, it was nothing but a superficial attraction,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div>pursued Oblonsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) being such a perfect aristocrat, don't you know, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) future position in society, had an influence not with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>), but with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) mother.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin scowled.
<p/>The humiliation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) rejection stung him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to the heart, as though it were a fresh wound he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had only just received.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was at home, and the walls of home are a support.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay, stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began, interrupting Oblonsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You talk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) being an aristocrat.
<p/>But allow me to ask what it consists in, that aristocracy of Vronsky or of anybody else, beside which I can be looked down upon?
<p/>You consider Vronsky an aristocrat, but I don't.
<p/>A man whose father crawled up from nothing at all by intrigue, and whose mother--God knows whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wasn't mixed up with....  No, excuse me, but I consider myself aristocratic, and people like me, who can point back in the past to three or four honorable generations of their family, of the highest degree of breeding -LRB-talent and intellect, of course that's another matter-RRB-, and have never curried favor with anyone, never depended on anyone for anything, like my father and my grandfather.
<p/>And I know many such.
<p/>You think it mean of me to count the trees in my forest, while you make Ryabinin a present of thirty thousand; but you get rents from your lands and I don't know what, while I don't and so I prize what's come to me from my ancestors or been won by hard work....

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but whom are you attacking?
<p/>I agree with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, sincerely and genially; though he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was aware that in the class of those who could be bought for twopence halfpenny Levin was reckoning him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) too.
<p/>Levin's warmth gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) genuine pleasure.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom are you attacking?
<p/>Though a good deal is not true that you say about Vronsky, but I won't talk about that.

<p/>Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) became as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been in the morning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not angry with me, Stiva?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not; not a bit, and no reason to be.
<p/>I'm glad we've spoken openly.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Capital.''
 (<font color='red'><b>all Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 18   Although all Vronsky's inner life was absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) passion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) external life unalterably and inevitably followed along the old accustomed lines of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) social and regimental ties and interests.
<p/>The interests of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) regiment took an important place in Vronsky's life, both because he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was fond of the regiment, and because the regiment was fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>They were not only fond of Vronsky in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) regiment, they respected him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) too, and were proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>); proud that this man, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immense wealth, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brilliant education and abilities, and the path open before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to every kind of success, distinction, and ambition, had disregarded all that, and of all the interests of life had the interests of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regiment and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comrades nearest to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Vronsky was aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) comrades' view of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), and in addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) liking for the life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) felt bound to keep up that reputation.
<p/>It need not be said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) did not speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) love to any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) comrades, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) betray his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) secret even in the wildest drinking bouts -LRB-though indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was never so drunk as to lose all control of himself-RRB-.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) shut up any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) thoughtless comrades who attempted to allude to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) connection.
<p/>But in spite of that, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) love was known to all the town; everyone guessed with more or less confidence at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) relations with Madame Karenina.
<p/>The majority of the younger men envied him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) for just what was the most irksome factor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) love--the exalted position of Karenin, and the consequent publicity of their connection in society.
<p/>The greater number of the young women, who envied Anna and had long been weary of hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) called  virtuous , rejoiced at the fulfillment of their predictions, and were only waiting for a decisive turn in public opinion to fall upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with all the weight of their scorn.
<p/>They were already making ready their handfuls of mud to fling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) when the right moment arrived.
<p/>The greater number of the middle-aged people and certain great personages were displeased at the prospect of the impending scandal in society.
<p/>Vronsky's mother, on hearing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) connection, was at first pleased at it, because nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind gave such a finishing touch to a brilliant young man as a  liaison  in the highest society; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was pleased, too, that Madame Karenina, who had so taken her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fancy, and had talked so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son, was, after all, just like all other pretty and well-bred women,--at least according to the Countess Vronskaya's ideas.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) had heard of late that her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) son had refused a position offered him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) of great importance to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) career, simply in order to remain in the regiment, where he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could be constantly seeing Madame Karenina.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) learned that great personages were displeased with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) on this account, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) opinion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) was vexed, too, that from all she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) could learn of this connection it was not that brilliant, graceful, worldly  liaison  which she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) would have welcomed, but a sort of Wertherish, desperate passion, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) was told, which might well lead him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) into imprudence.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) since his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) abrupt departure from Moscow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) elder son to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) come to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>).
<p/>This elder son, too, was displeased with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) younger brother.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did not distinguish what sort of love his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might be, big or little, passionate or passionless, lasting or passing -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) kept a ballet girl himself, though he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was the father of a family, so he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was lenient in these matters-RRB-, but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) knew that this love affair was viewed with displeasure by those whom it was necessary to please, and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did not approve of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) brother's conduct.
<p/>Besides the service and society, Vronsky had another great interest--horses; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was passionately fond of horses.
<p/>That year races and a steeplechase had been arranged for the officers.
<p/>Vronsky had put his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) name down, bought a thoroughbred English mare, and in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) love affair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was looking forward to the races with intense, though reserved, excitement...
<p/>These two passions did not interfere with one another.
<p/>On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) needed occupation and distraction quite apart from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) love, so as to recruit and rest himself from the violent emotions that agitated him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 19   On the day of the races at Krasnoe Selo, Vronsky had come earlier than usual to eat beefsteak in the common messroom of the regiment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had no need to be strict with himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had very quickly been brought down to the required light weight; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had to avoid gaining flesh, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) eschewed farinaceous and sweet dishes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) coat unbuttoned over a white waistcoat, resting both elbows on the table, and while waiting for the steak he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had ordered he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) looked at a French novel that lay open on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) plate.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was only looking at the book to avoid conversation with the officers coming in and out; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was thinking.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was thinking of Anna's promise to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) that day after the races.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) for three days, and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband had just returned from abroad, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) did not know whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would be able to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) today or not, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) did not know how to find out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) last interview with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) cousin Betsy's summer villa.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) visited the Karenins' summer villa as rarely as possible.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) wanted to go there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) pondered the question how to do it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I shall say Betsy has sent me to ask whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>)'s coming to the races.
<p/>Of course, I'll go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) decided, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) head from the book.
<p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) vividly pictured the happiness of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) face lighted up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Send to my house, and tell them to have out the carriage and three horses as quick as they can,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said to the servant, who handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) the steak on a hot silver dish, and moving the dish up he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) began eating.
<p/>From the billiard room next door came the sound of balls knocking, of talk and laughter.
<p/>Two officers appeared at the entrance-door:  one, a young fellow, with a feeble, delicate face, who had lately joined the regiment from the Corps of Pages; the other, a plump, elderly officer, with a bracelet on his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) wrist, and little eyes, lost in fat.
<p/>Vronsky glanced at them, frowned, and looking down at his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) book as though he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had not noticed them, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) proceeded to eat and read at the same time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?
<p/>Fortifying yourself for your work?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div><p/>said the plump officer, sitting down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``As you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>responded Vronsky, knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) brows, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) mouth, and not looking at the officer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you're not afraid of getting fat?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div><p/>said the latter, turning a chair round for the young officer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vronsky angrily, making a wry face of disgust, and showing his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) even teeth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not afraid of getting fat?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Waiter, sherry!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vronsky, without replying, and moving the book to the other side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Waiter</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Waiter</b></font>) went on reading.
<p/>The plump officer took up the list of wines and turned to the young officer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You choose what we're to drink,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) said, handing him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) the card, and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rhine wine, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>said the young officer, stealing a timid glance at Vronsky, and trying to pull his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) scarcely visible mustache.
<p/>Seeing that Vronsky did not turn round, the young officer got up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go into the billiard room,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) said.
<p/>The plump officer rose submissively, and they moved towards the door.
<p/>At that moment there walked into the room the tall and well-built Captain Yashvin.
<p/>Nodding with an air of lofty contempt to the two officers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) went up to Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>here he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) cried, bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) big hand down heavily on his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) epaulet.
<p/>Vronsky looked round angrily, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) face lighted up immediately with his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) characteristic expression of genial and manly serenity.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it, Alexey,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>said the captain, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) loud baritone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must just eat a mouthful, now, and drink only one tiny glass.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm not hungry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There go the inseparables,''  (<font color='red'><b>Yashvin/Prince Yashvin</b></font>)</div>Yashvin dropped, glancing sarcastically at the two officers who were at that instant leaving the room.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) long legs, swathed in tight riding breeches, and sat down in the chair, too low for him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>), so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) knees were cramped up in a sharp angle.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you turn up at the Red Theater yesterday?
<p/>Numerova wasn't at all bad.
<p/>Where were you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was late at the Tverskoys',''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Yashvin/Prince Yashvin</b></font>)</div><p/>responded Yashvin.
<p/>Yashvin, a gambler and a rake, a man not merely without moral principles, but of immoral principles, Yashvin was Vronsky's greatest friend in the regiment.
<p/>Vronsky liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) both for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) exceptional physical strength, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) showed for the most part by being able to drink like a fish, and do without sleep without being in the slightest degree affected by it; and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) great strength of character, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) showed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) relations with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) comrades and superior officers, commanding both fear and respect, and also at cards, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) would play for tens of thousands and however much he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) might have drunk, always with such skill and decision that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was reckoned the best player in the English Club.
<p/>Vronsky respected and liked Yashvin particularly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) felt Yashvin liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>), not for his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) name and his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) money, but for himself.
<p/>And of all men he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) was the only one with whom Vronsky would have liked to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) love.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) felt that Yashvin, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) apparent contempt for every sort of feeling, was the only man who could, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) fancied, comprehend the intense passion which now filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) whole life.
<p/>Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) felt certain that Yashvin, as it was, took no delight in gossip and scandal, and interpreted his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) feeling rightly, that is to say, knew and believed that this passion was not a jest, not a pastime, but something more serious and important.
<p/>Vronsky had never spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) passion, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) was aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) knew all about it, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) put the right interpretation on it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) was glad to see that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) said, to the announcement that Vronsky had been at the Tverskoys'; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) black eyes shining, he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) plucked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) left mustache, and began twisting it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) mouth, a bad habit he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) had.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and what did you do yesterday?
<p/>Win anything?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eight thousand.
<p/>But three don't count; he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) won't pay up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, then you can afford to lose over me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, laughing.
<p/>-LRB-Yashvin had bet heavily on Vronsky in the races.-RRB-
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No chance of my losing.
<p/>Mahotin's the only one that's risky.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>And the conversation passed to forecasts of the coming race, the only thing Vronsky could think of just now.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along, I've finished,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, and getting up he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) went to the door.
<p/>Yashvin got up too, stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) long legs and his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) long back.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's too early for me to dine, but I must have a drink.
<p/>I'll come along directly.
<p/>Hi, wine!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) shouted, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) rich voice, that always rang out so loudly at drill, and set the windows shaking now.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) shouted again immediately after.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're going home, so I'll go with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) walked out with Vronsky.
<p/>Chapter 20   Vronsky was staying in a roomy, clean, Finnish hut, divided into two by a partition.
<p/>Petritsky lived with him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) in camp too.
<p/>Petritsky was asleep when Vronsky and Yashvin came into the hut.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get up, don't go on sleeping,''  (<font color='red'><b>Yashvin/Prince Yashvin</b></font>)</div>said Yashvin, going behind the partition and giving Petritsky, who was lying with ruffled hair and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) nose in the pillow, a prod on the shoulder.
<p/>Petritsky jumped up suddenly onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) knees and looked round.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your brother's been here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) said to Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) waked me up, damn him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>), and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>)'d look in again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And pulling up the rug he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) flung himself back on the pillow.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do shut up, Yashvin!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) said, getting furious with Yashvin, who was pulling the rug off him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut up!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) turned over and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better tell me what to drink; such a nasty taste in my mouth, that...''   (<font color='red'><b>Yashvin/Prince Yashvin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Brandy's better than anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Yashvin/Prince Yashvin</b></font>)</div>boomed Yashvin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tereshtchenko!
<p/>brandy for your master and cucumbers,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) shouted, obviously taking pleasure in the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) own voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brandy, do you think?
<p/>Eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Petritsky</b></font>)</div><p/>queried Petritsky, blinking and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'll drink something?
<p/>All right then, we'll have a drink together!
<p/>Vronsky, have a drink?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Petritsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Petritsky, getting up and wrapping the tiger-skin rug round him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) went to the door of the partition wall, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) hands, and hummed in French, <div class="bookquote">``There was a king in Thule.''
 (<font color='red'><b>French</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Vronsky, will you have a drink?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go along,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, putting on the coat his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) valet handed to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you off to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Yashvin/Prince Yashvin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Yashvin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, here are your three horses,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) added, seeing the carriage drive up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the stables, and I've got to see Bryansky, too, about the horses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky.
<p/>Vronsky had as a fact promised to call at Bryansky's, some eight miles from Peterhof, and to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) some money owing for some horses; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) hoped to have time to get that in too.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) comrades were at once aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) was not only going there.
<p/>Petritsky, still humming, winked and made a pout with his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) lips, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) would say: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, we know your Bryansky.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind you're not late!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Yashvin/Prince Yashvin</b></font>)</div><p/>was Yashvin's only comment; and to change the conversation: <div class="bookquote">``How's my roan?
<p/>is he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) doing all right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Yashvin/Prince Yashvin</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) inquired, looking out of the window at the middle one of the three horses, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) had sold Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Petritsky</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Petritsky to Vronsky as he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) was just going out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your brother left a letter and a note for you.
<p/>Wait a bit; where are they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky stopped.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, where are they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are they?
<p/>That's just the question!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Petritsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Petritsky solemnly, moving his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) forefinger upwards from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) nose.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, tell me; this is silly!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vronsky smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not lighted the fire.
<p/>Here somewhere about.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, enough fooling!
<p/>Where is the letter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I've forgotten really.
<p/>Or was it a dream?
<p/>Wait a bit, wait a bit!
<p/>But what's the use of getting in a rage.
<p/>If you'd drunk four bottles yesterday as I did you'd forget where you were lying.
<p/>Wait a bit, I'll remember!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Petritsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Petritsky went behind the partition and lay down on his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) bed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a bit!
<p/>This was how I was lying, and this was how he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was standing.
<p/>Yes--yes--yes....
<p/>Here it is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Petritsky</b></font>)</div><p/>--and Petritsky pulled a letter out from under the mattress, where he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had hidden it.
<p/>Vronsky took the letter and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) brother's note.
<p/>It was the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was expecting--from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mother, reproaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) for not having been to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--and the note was from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) brother to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) must have a little talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>Vronsky knew that it was all about the same thing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What business is it of theirs!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Vronsky, and crumpling up the letters he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) thrust them between the buttons of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) coat so as to read them carefully on the road.
<p/>In the porch of the hut he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was met by two officers; one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) regiment and one of another.
<p/>Vronsky's quarters were always a meeting place for all the officers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you off to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go to Peterhof.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has the mare come from Tsarskoe?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I've not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say Mahotin's Gladiator's lame.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!
<p/>But however are you going to race in this mud?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>said the other.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here are my saviors!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Petritsky</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Petritsky, seeing them come in.
<p/>Before him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) stood the orderly with a tray of brandy and salted cucumbers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's Yashvin ordering me to drink a pick-me-up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you did give it to us yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one of those who had come in; <div class="bookquote">``you didn't let us get a wink of sleep all night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, didn't we make a pretty finish!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Petritsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Petritsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Volkov climbed onto the roof and began telling us how sad he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was.
<p/>I said: `Let's have music, the funeral march!'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) fairly dropped asleep on the roof over the funeral march.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Drink it up; you positively must drink the brandy, and then seltzer water and a lot of lemon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Yashvin/Prince Yashvin</b></font>)</div>said Yashvin, standing over Petritsky like a mother making a child take medicine, <div class="bookquote">``and then a little champagne--just a small bottle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, there's some sense in that.
<p/>Stop a bit, Vronsky.
<p/>We'll all have a drink.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; good-bye all of you.
<p/>I'm not going to drink today.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, are you gaining weight?
<p/>All right, then we must have it alone.
<p/>Give us the seltzer water and lemon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Vronsky!''
 (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div><p/>shouted someone when he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) was already outside.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better get your hair cut, it'll weigh you down, especially at the top.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky was in fact beginning, prematurely, to get a little bald.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) laughed gaily, showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) even teeth, and pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) cap over the thin place, went out and got into his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) carriage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the stables!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) said, and was just pulling out the letters to read them through, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) thought better of it, and put off reading them so as not to distract his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) attention before looking at the mare.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Later!''
 (<font color='red'><b>mare</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 21   The temporary stable, a wooden shed, had been put up close to the race course, and there his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) mare was to have been taken the previous day.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) had not yet seen her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) there.
<p/>During the last few days he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) had not ridden her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) out for exercise himself, but had put her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) in the charge of the trainer, and so now he (<font color='blue'><b>trainer</b></font>) positively did not know in what condition his (<font color='blue'><b>trainer</b></font>) mare had arrived yesterday and was today.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>trainer</b></font>) had scarcely got out of his (<font color='blue'><b>trainer</b></font>) carriage when his (<font color='blue'><b>trainer</b></font>) groom, the so-called <div class="bookquote">``stable boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>groom boy</b></font>)</div>recognizing the carriage some way off, called the trainer.
<p/>A dry-looking Englishman, in high boots and a short jacket, clean-shaven, except for a tuft below his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) chin, came to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>), walking with the uncouth gait of jockey, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) elbows out and swaying from side to side.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how's Frou-Frou?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky asked in English.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Englishman</b></font>)</div>the Englishman's voice responded somewhere in the inside of his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) throat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better not go in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) added, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) hat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've put a muzzle on her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>), and the mare's fidgety.
<p/>Better not go in, it'll excite the mare.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm going in.
<p/>I want to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Englishman</b></font>)</div>said the Englishman, frowning, and speaking with his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) mouth shut, and, with swinging elbows, he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) went on in front with his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) disjointed gait.
<p/>They went into the little yard in front of the shed.
<p/>A stable boy, spruce and smart in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) holiday attire, met them with a broom in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand, and followed them.
<p/>In the shed there were five horses in their separate stalls, and Vronsky knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) chief rival, Gladiator, a very tall chestnut horse, had been brought there, and must be standing among them.
<p/>Even more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mare, Vronsky longed to see Gladiator, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had never seen.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) knew that by the etiquette of the race course it was not merely impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) to see the horse, but improper even to ask questions about him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was passing along the passage, the boy opened the door into the second horse-box on the left, and Vronsky caught a glimpse of a big chestnut horse with white legs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew that this was Gladiator, but, with the feeling of a man turning away from the sight of another man's open letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned round and went into Frou-Frou's stall.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The horse is here belonging to Mak...Mak...I never can say the name,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Englishman</b></font>)</div>said the Englishman, over his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) shoulder, pointing his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) big finger and dirty nail towards Gladiator's stall.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mahotin?
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>)'s my most serious rival,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were riding him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the Englishman</b></font>)</div>said the Englishman, <div class="bookquote">``I'd bet on you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Englishman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Frou-Frou's more nervous; he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>)'s stronger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, smiling at the compliment to his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) riding.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a steeplechase it all depends on riding and on pluck,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Englishman</b></font>)</div>said the Englishman.
<p/>Of pluck--that is, energy and courage--Vronsky did not merely feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) had enough; what was of far more importance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) was firmly convinced that no one in the world could have more of this <div class="bookquote">``pluck''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>than he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) had.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think I want more thinning down?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Englishman</b></font>)</div>answered the Englishman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, don't speak loud.
<p/>The mare's fidgety,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) added, nodding towards the horse-box, before which they were standing, and from which came the sound of restless stamping in the straw.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) opened the door, and Vronsky went into the horse-box, dimly lighted by one little window.
<p/>In the horse-box stood a dark bay mare, with a muzzle on, picking at the fresh straw with her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) hoofs.
<p/>Looking round him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) in the twilight of the horse-box, Vronsky unconsciously took in once more in a comprehensive glance all the points of his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) favorite mare.
<p/>Frou-Frou was a beast of medium size, not altogether free from reproach, from a breeder's point of view.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) was small-boned all over; though her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) chest was extremely prominent in front, it was narrow.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) hind-quarters were a little drooping, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) fore-legs, and still more in her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) hind-legs, there was a noticeable curvature.
<p/>The muscles of both hind- and fore-legs were not very thick; but across her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) shoulders the mare was exceptionally broad, a peculiarity specially striking now that she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) was lean from training.
<p/>The bones of her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) legs below the knees looked no thicker than a finger from in front, but were extraordinarily thick seen from the side.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) looked altogether, except across the shoulders, as it were, pinched in at the sides and pressed out in depth.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) had in the highest degree the quality that makes all defects forgotten: that quality was  blood , the blood that tells , as the English expression has it.
<p/>The muscles stood up sharply under the network of sinews, covered with the delicate, mobile skin, soft as satin, and they were hard as bone.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) clean-cut head, with prominent, bright, spirited eyes, broadened out at the open nostrils, that showed the red blood in the cartilage within.
<p/>About all her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) figure, and especially her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) head, there was a certain expression of energy, and, at the same time, of softness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) was one of those creatures which seem only not to speak because the mechanism of their mouth does not allow them to.
<p/>To Vronsky, at any rate, it seemed that she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) understood all he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) felt at that moment, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>).
<p/>Directly Vronsky went towards her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) drew in a deep breath, and, turning back her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) prominent eye till the white looked bloodshot, she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) started at the approaching figures from the opposite side, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) muzzle, and shifting lightly from one leg to the other.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, you see how fidgety she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Englishman</b></font>)</div>said the Englishman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, darling!
<p/>There!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vronsky, going up to the mare and speaking soothingly to her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>).
<p/>But the nearer he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) came, the more excited she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) grew.
<p/>Only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) stood by her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) was suddenly quieter, while the muscles quivered under her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) soft, delicate coat.
<p/>Vronsky patted her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) strong neck, straightened over her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) sharp withers a stray lock of her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) mane that had fallen on the other side, and moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) face near her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) dilated nostrils, transparent as a bat's wing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) drew a loud breath and snorted out through her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) tense nostrils, started, pricked up her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) sharp ear, and put out her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) strong, black lip towards Vronsky, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) would nip hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) sleeve.
<p/>But remembering the muzzle, she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) shook it and again began restlessly stamping one after the other her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) shapely legs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quiet, darling, quiet!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said, patting her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) again over her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) hind-quarters; and with a glad sense that his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) mare was in the best possible condition, he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) went out of the horse-box.
<p/>The mare's excitement had infected Vronsky.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) heart was throbbing, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), too, like the mare, longed to move, to bite; it was both dreadful and delicious.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I rely on you, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) said to the Englishman; <div class="bookquote">``half-past six on the ground.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Englishman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Englishman</b></font>)</div>said the Englishman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, where are you going, my lord?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) asked suddenly, using the title <div class="bookquote">``my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had scarcely ever used before.
<p/>Vronsky in amazement raised his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) head, and stared, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) knew how to stare, not into the Englishman's eyes, but at his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) forehead, astounded at the impertinence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) question.
<p/>But realizing that in asking this the Englishman had been looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) not as an employer, but as a jockey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) answered:  <div class="bookquote">``I've got to go to Bryansky's; I shall be home within an hour.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How often I'm asked that question today!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) said to himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) blushed, a thing which rarely happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>).
<p/>The Englishman looked gravely at him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>); and, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>), too, knew where Vronsky was going, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) added:  <div class="bookquote">``The great thing's to keep quiet before a race,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``don't get out of temper or upset about anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>right Vronsky</b></font>)</div>answered Vronsky, smiling; and jumping into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) carriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) told the man to drive to Peterhof.
<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had driven many paces away, the dark clouds that had been threatening rain all day broke, and there was a heavy downpour of rain.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Vronsky, putting up the roof of the carriage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was muddy before, now it will be a perfect swamp.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) sat in solitude in the closed carriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mother's letter and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) brother's note, and read them through.
<p/>Yes, it was the same thing over and over again.
<p/>Everyone, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mother, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) brother, everyone thought fit to interfere in the affairs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) heart.
<p/>This interference aroused in him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) a feeling of angry hatred--a feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had rarely known before.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What business is it of theirs?
<p/>Why does everybody feel called upon to concern himself about me?
<p/>And why do they worry me so?
<p/>Just because they see that this is something they can't understand.
<p/>If it were a common, vulgar, worldly intrigue, they would have left me alone.
<p/>They feel that this is something different, that this is not a mere pastime, that this woman is dearer to me than life.
<p/>And this is incomprehensible, and that's why it annoys them.
<p/>Whatever our destiny is or may be, we have made it ourselves, and we do not complain of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said, in the word we  linking himself with Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, they must needs teach us how to live.
<p/>They haven't an idea of what happiness is; they don't know that without our love, for us there is neither happiness nor unhappiness--no life at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) thought.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was angry with all of them for their interference just because he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) soul that they, all these people, were right.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) felt that the love that bound him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) to Anna was not a momentary impulse, which would pass, as worldly intrigues do pass, leaving no other traces in the life of either but pleasant or unpleasant memories.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) felt all the torture of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) position, all the difficulty there was for them, conspicuous as they were in the eye of all the world, in concealing their love, in lying and deceiving; and in lying, deceiving, feigning, and continually thinking of others, when the passion that united them was so intense that they were both oblivious of everything else but their love.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) vividly recalled all the constantly recurring instances of inevitable necessity for lying and deceit, which were so against his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) natural bent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) recalled particularly vividly the shame he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had more than once detected in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) at this necessity for lying and deceit.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) experienced the strange feeling that had sometimes come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) since his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) secret love for Anna.
<p/>This was a feeling of loathing for something--whether for Alexey Alexandrovitch, or for himself, or for the whole world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not have said.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) always drove away this strange feeling.
<p/>Now, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) shook it off and continued the thread of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) thoughts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was unhappy before, but proud and at peace; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cannot be at peace and feel secure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dignity, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) does not show it.
<p/>Yes, we must put an end to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) decided.
<p/>And for the first time the idea clearly presented itself that it was essential to put an end to this false position, and the sooner the better.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Throw up everything, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and I, and hide ourselves somewhere alone with our love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said to himself.
<p/>Chapter 22   The rain did not last long, and by the time Vronsky arrived, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) shaft-horse trotting at full speed and dragging the trace-horses galloping through the mud, with their reins hanging loose, the sun had peeped out again, the roofs of the summer villas and the old limetrees in the gardens on both sides of the principal streets sparkled with wet brilliance, and from the twigs came a pleasant drip and from the roofs rushing streams of water.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) thought no more of the shower spoiling the race course, but was rejoicing now that--thanks to the rain--he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would be sure to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) at home and alone, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knew that Alexey Alexandrovitch, who had lately returned from a foreign watering place, had not moved from Petersburg.
<p/>Hoping to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) alone, Vronsky alighted, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) always did, to avoid attracting attention, before crossing the bridge, and walked to the house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) did not go up the steps to the street door, but went into the court.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has your master come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) asked a gardener.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir.
<p/>The mistress is at home.
<p/>But will you please go to the front door; there are servants there,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gardener</b></font>)</div>the gardener answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll open the door.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'll go in from the garden.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And feeling satisfied that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was alone, and wanting to take her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) by surprise, since he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) had not promised to be there today, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) would certainly not expect him (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) to come before the races, he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) walked, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) sword and stepping cautiously over the sandy path, bordered with flowers, to the terrace that looked out upon the garden.
<p/>Vronsky forgot now all that he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) had thought on the way of the hardships and difficulties of their position.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) thought of nothing but that he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) would see her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) directly, not in imagination, but living, all of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was in reality.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) was just going in, stepping on his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) whole foot so as not to creak, up the worn steps of the terrace, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) suddenly remembered what he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) always forgot, and what caused the most torturing side of his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) relations with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) son with his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) questioning--hostile, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) fancied--eyes.
<p/>This boy was more often than anyone else a check upon their freedom.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) was present, both Vronsky and Anna did not merely avoid speaking of anything that they could not have repeated before everyone; they did not even allow themselves to refer by hints to anything the boy did not understand.
<p/>They had made no agreement about this, it had settled itself.
<p/>They would have felt it wounding themselves to deceive the child.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) presence they talked like acquaintances.
<p/>But in spite of this caution, Vronsky often saw the child's intent, bewildered glance fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and a strange shyness, uncertainty, at one time friendliness, at another, coldness and reserve, in the boy's manner to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); as though the child felt that between this man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother there existed some important bond, the significance of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not understand.
<p/>As a fact, the boy did feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could not understand this relation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tried painfully, and was not able to make clear to himself what feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ought to have for this man.
<p/>With a child's keen instinct for every manifestation of feeling, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw distinctly that his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) governess, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nurse,--all did not merely dislike Vronsky, but looked on him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with horror and aversion, though they never said anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), while his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother looked on him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) greatest friend.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it mean?
<p/>Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?
<p/>How ought I to love him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?
<p/>If I don't know, it's my fault; either I'm stupid or a naughty boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>thought the child.
<p/>And this was what caused his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dubious, inquiring, sometimes hostile, expression, and the shyness and uncertainty which Vronsky found so irksome.
<p/>This child's presence always and infallibly called up in Vronsky that strange feeling of inexplicable loathing which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had experienced of late.
<p/>This child's presence called up both in Vronsky and in Anna a feeling akin to the feeling of a sailor who sees by the compass that the direction in which he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) is swiftly moving is far from the right one, but that to arrest his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) motion is not in his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) power, that every instant is carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) further and further away, and that to admit to himself his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) deviation from the right direction is the same as admitting his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) certain ruin.
<p/>This child, with his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) innocent outlook upon life, was the compass that showed them the point to which they had departed from what they knew, but did not want to know.
<p/>This time Seryozha was not at home, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was completely alone.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was sitting on the terrace waiting for the return of her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) son, who had gone out for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) walk and been caught in the rain.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) had sent a manservant and a maid out to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>Dressed in a white gown, deeply embroidered, she (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was sitting in a corner of the terrace behind some flowers, and did not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>Bending her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) curly black head, she (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) forehead against a cool watering pot that stood on the parapet, and both her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) lovely hands, with the rings he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) knew so well, clasped the pot.
<p/>The beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) whole figure, her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) head, her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) neck, her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) hands, struck Vronsky every time as something new and unexpected.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) stood still, gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) in ecstasy.
<p/>But, directly he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would have made a step to come nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) presence, pushed away the watering pot, and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) flushed face towards him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?
<p/>You are ill?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) in French, going up to her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would have run to her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>), but remembering that there might be spectators, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) looked round towards the balcony door, and reddened a little, as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) always reddened, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had to be afraid and be on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) guard.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm quite well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) said, getting up and pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) outstretched hand tightly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not expect...thee.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy!
<p/>what cold hands!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You startled me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm alone, and expecting Seryozha; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s out for a walk; they'll come in from this side.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) efforts to be calm, her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) lips were quivering.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me for coming, but I couldn't pass the day without seeing you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) went on, speaking French, as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) always did to avoid using the stiff Russian plural form, so impossibly frigid between them, and the dangerously intimate singular.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive you?
<p/>I'm so glad!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you're ill or worried,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) went on, not letting go her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) hands and bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What were you thinking of?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Always the same thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) said, with a smile.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) spoke the truth.
<p/>If ever at any moment she (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) had been asked what she (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was thinking of, she (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) could have answered truly: of the same thing, of her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) happiness and her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) unhappiness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was thinking, just when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>), of this: why was it, she (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) wondered, that to others, to Betsy -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) knew of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) secret connection with Tushkevitch-RRB- it was all easy, while to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) it was such torture?
<p/>Today this thought gained special poignancy from certain other considerations.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) about the races.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) questions, and, seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) was agitated, trying to calm her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) began telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) in the simplest tone the details of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) preparations for the races.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) or not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) thought, looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) quiet, affectionate eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is so happy, so absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) races that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) won't understand as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ought, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) won't understand all the gravity of this fact to us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you haven't told me what you were thinking of when I came in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, interrupting his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) narrative; <div class="bookquote">``please tell me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) did not answer, and, bending her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) head a little, she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) looked inquiringly at him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) brows, her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) eyes shining under their long lashes.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) hand shook as it played with a leaf she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) had picked.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) saw it, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) face expressed that utter subjection, that slavish devotion, which had done so much to win her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see something has happened.
<p/>Do you suppose I can be at peace, knowing you have a trouble I am not sharing?
<p/>Tell me, for God's sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) repeated imploringly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shan't be able to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) does not realize all the gravity of it.
<p/>Better not tell; why put him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to the proof?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) thought, still staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in the same way, and feeling the hand that held the leaf was trembling more and more.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For God's sake!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) repeated, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, yes .
<p/>.
<p/>.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm with child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) said, softly and deliberately.
<p/>The leaf in her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) hand shook more violently, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) did not take her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) eyes off him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), watching how he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would take it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) turned white, would have said something, but stopped; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) hand, and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head sank on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) breast.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) realizes all the gravity of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) thought, and gratefully she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) was mistaken in thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) realized the gravity of the fact as she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>), a woman, realized it.
<p/>On hearing it, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with tenfold intensity that strange feeling of loathing of someone.
<p/>But at the same time, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt that the turning-point he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been longing for had come now; that it was impossible to go on concealing things from her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) husband, and it was inevitable in one way or another that they should soon put an end to their unnatural position.
<p/>But, besides that, her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) emotion physically affected him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in the same way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) with a look of submissive tenderness, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) hand, got up, and, in silence, paced up and down the terrace.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, going up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) resolutely.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither you nor I have looked on our relations as a passing amusement, and now our fate is sealed.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) said softly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) was calmer now, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) face lighted up with a tender smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave your husband and make our life one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is one as it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) answered, scarcely audibly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but altogether; altogether.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how, Alexey, tell me how?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) said in melancholy mockery at the hopelessness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) own position.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there any way out of such a position?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a way out of every position.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not over my husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, with a quiet smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we won't talk of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chapter Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 23   Vronsky had several times already, though not so resolutely as now, tried to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to consider their position, and every time he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been confronted by the same superficiality and triviality with which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) appeal now.
<p/>It was as though there were something in this which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could not or would not face, as though directly she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) began to speak of this, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), the real Anna, retreated somehow into herself, and another strange and unaccountable woman came out, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not love, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) feared, and who was in opposition to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>But today he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was resolved to have it out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knows or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) usual quiet and resolute tone, <div class="bookquote">``that's nothing to do with us.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who had so feared he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) condition too lightly was now vexed with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for deducing from it the necessity of taking some step.

<p/>Vronsky could not understand how she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) strong and truthful nature, could endure this state of deceit, and not long to get out of it.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did not suspect that the chief cause of it was the word-- son , which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not bring herself to pronounce.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) future attitude to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother, who had abandoned his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt such terror at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had done, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not face it; but, like a woman, could only try to comfort herself with lying assurances that everything would remain as it always had been, and that it was possible to forget the fearful question of how it would be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg you, I entreat you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said suddenly, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hand, and speaking in quite a different tone, sincere and tender, <div class="bookquote">``never speak to me of that!''

(<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could hear the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) son's voice coming towards them, and glancing swiftly round the terrace, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) got up impulsively.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) eyes glowed with the fire he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) knew so well; with a rapid movement she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) lovely hands, covered with rings, took his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) head, looked a long look into his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) face, and, putting up her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) face with smiling, parted lips, swiftly kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mouth and both eyes, and pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) away.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) would have gone, but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) back.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) murmured in a whisper, gazing in ecstasy at her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tonight, at one o'clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) whispered, and, with a heavy sigh, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) light, swift step to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) son.
<p/>Seryozha had been caught by the rain in the big garden, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) nurse had taken shelter in an arbor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,  au revoir ,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said to Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must soon be getting ready for the races.
<p/>Betsy promised to fetch me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) watch, went away hurriedly.
<p/>Chapter 24   When Vronsky looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) watch on the Karenins' balcony, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was so greatly agitated and lost in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) thoughts that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) saw the figures on the watch's face, but could not take in what time it was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) came out on to the high road and walked, picking his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) way carefully through the mud, to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) carriage.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was so completely absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) feeling for Anna, that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did not even think what o'clock it was, and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had time to go to Bryansky's.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had left him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), as often happens, only the external faculty of memory, that points out each step one has to take, one after the other.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) coachman, who was dozing on the box in the shadow, already lengthening, of a thick limetree; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) admired the shifting clouds of midges circling over the hot horses, and, waking the coachman, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) jumped into the carriage, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to drive to Bryansky's.
<p/>It was only after driving nearly five miles that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had sufficiently recovered himself to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) watch, and realize that it was half-past five, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was late.
<p/>There were several races fixed for that day: the Mounted Guards' race, then the officers' mile-and-a-half race, then the three-mile race, and then the race for which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was entered.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could still be in time for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) race, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) went to Bryansky's he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could only just be in time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would arrive when the whole of the court would be in their places.
<p/>That would be a pity.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had promised Bryansky to come, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) decided to drive on, telling the coachman not to spare the horses.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) reached Bryansky's, spent five minutes there, and galloped back.
<p/>This rapid drive calmed him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>All that was painful in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) relations with Anna, all the feeling of indefiniteness left by their conversation, had slipped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was thinking now with pleasure and excitement of the race, of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) being anyhow, in time, and now and then the thought of the blissful interview awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) that night flashed across his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) imagination like a flaming light.
<p/>The excitement of the approaching race gained upon him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) drove further and further into the atmosphere of the races, overtaking carriages driving up from the summer villas or out of Petersburg.
<p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) quarters no one was left at home; all were at the races, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) valet was looking out for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) at the gate.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was changing his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) clothes, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) valet told him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) that the second race had begun already, that a lot of gentlemen had been to ask for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and a boy had twice run up from the stables.
<p/>Dressing without hurry -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) never hurried himself, and never lost his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) self-possession-RRB-, Vronsky drove to the sheds.
<p/>From the sheds he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) could see a perfect sea of carriages, and people on foot, soldiers surrounding the race course, and pavilions swarming with people.
<p/>The second race was apparently going on, for just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) went into the sheds he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) heard a bell ringing.
<p/>Going towards the stable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) met the white-legged chestnut, Mahotin's Gladiator, being led to the race-course in a blue forage horsecloth, with what looked like huge ears edged with blue.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Cord?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) asked the stable-boy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the stable, putting on the saddle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In the open horse-box stood Frou-Frou, saddled ready.
<p/>They were just going to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not too late?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right!
<p/>All right!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Englishman</b></font>)</div><p/>said the Englishman; <div class="bookquote">``don't upset yourself!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Englishman</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky once more took in in one glance the exquisite lines of his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) favorite mare; who was quivering all over, and with an effort he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) tore himself from the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>), and went out of the stable.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) went towards the pavilions at the most favorable moment for escaping attention.
<p/>The mile-and-a-half race was just finishing, and all eyes were fixed on the horse-guard in front and the light hussar behind, urging their horses on with a last effort close to the winning post.
<p/>From the center and outside of the ring all were crowding to the winning post, and a group of soldiers and officers of the horse-guards were shouting loudly their delight at the expected triumph of their officer and comrade.
<p/>Vronsky moved into the middle of the crowd unnoticed, almost at the very moment when the bell rang at the finish of the race, and the tall, mudspattered horse-guard who came in first, bending over the saddle, let go the reins of his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) panting gray horse that looked dark with sweat.
<p/>The horse, stiffening out its legs, with an effort stopped its rapid course, and the officer of the horse-guards looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) like a man waking up from a heavy sleep, and just managed to smile.
<p/>A crowd of friends and outsiders pressed round him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>).
<p/>Vronsky intentionally avoided that select crowd of the upper world, which was moving and talking with discreet freedom before the pavilions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) knew that Madame Karenina was there, and Betsy, and his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) brother's wife, and he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) purposely did not go near them for fear of something distracting his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) attention.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was continually met and stopped by acquaintances, who told him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) about the previous races, and kept asking him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was so late.
<p/>At the time when the racers had to go to the pavilion to receive the prizes, and all attention was directed to that point, Vronsky's elder brother, Alexander, a colonel with heavy fringed epaulets, came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexander</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexander</b></font>) was not tall, though as broadly built as Alexey, and handsomer and rosier than he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) had a red nose, and an open, drunken-looking face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you get my note?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's never any finding you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexander Vronsky, in spite of the dissolute life, and in especial the drunken habits, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was notorious, was quite one of the court circle.
<p/>Now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) talked to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) brother of a matter bound to be exceedingly disagreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), knowing that the eyes of many people might be fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) kept a smiling countenance, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) were jesting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) brother about something of little moment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I got it, and I really can't make out what  you  are worrying yourself about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm worrying myself because the remark has just been made to me that you weren't here, and that you were seen in Peterhof on Monday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are matters which only concern those directly interested in them, and the matter you are so worried about is...''   (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Vronsky</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but if so, you may as well cut the service...''   (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Vronsky</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I beg you not to meddle, and that's all I have to say.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Vronsky's frowning face turned white, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) prominent lower jaw quivered, which happened rarely with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>Being a man of very warm heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was seldom angry; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was angry, and when his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) chin quivered, then, as Alexander Vronsky knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was dangerous.
<p/>Alexander Vronsky smiled gaily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only wanted to give you Mother's letter.
<p/>Answer it, and don't worry about anything just before the race.
<p/>Bonne chance,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) added, smiling and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) moved away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>But after him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) another friendly greeting brought Vronsky to a standstill.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you won't recognize your friends!
<p/>How are you, mon cher?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, as conspicuously brilliant in the midst of all the Petersburg brilliance as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was in Moscow, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) face rosy, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) whiskers sleek and glossy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came up yesterday, and I'm delighted that I shall see your triumph.
<p/>When shall we meet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come tomorrow to the messroom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, and squeezing him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) by the sleeve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) coat, with apologies, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) moved away to the center of the race course, where the horses were being led for the great steeplechase.
<p/>The horses who had run in the last race were being led home, steaming and exhausted, by the stable-boys, and one after another the fresh horses for the coming race made their appearance, for the most part English racers, wearing horsecloths, and looking with their drawn-up bellies like strange, huge birds.
<p/>On the right was led in Frou-Frou, lean and beautiful, lifting up her (<font color='blue'><b>racers</b></font>) elastic, rather long pasterns, as though moved by springs.
<p/>Not far from her (<font color='blue'><b>racers</b></font>) they were taking the rug off the lop-eared Gladiator.
<p/>The strong, exquisite, perfectly correct lines of the stallion, with his (<font color='blue'><b>stallion</b></font>) superb hind-quarters and excessively short pasterns almost over his (<font color='blue'><b>stallion</b></font>) hoofs, attracted Vronsky's attention in spite of himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stallion</b></font>) would have gone up to his (<font color='blue'><b>stallion</b></font>) mare, but he (<font color='blue'><b>stallion</b></font>) was again detained by an acquaintance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, there's Karenin!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the acquaintance</b></font>)</div><p/>said the acquaintance with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was chatting.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)'s looking for his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) wife, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s in the middle of the pavilion.
<p/>Didn't you see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>No Vronsky</b></font>)</div>answered Vronsky, and without even glancing round towards the pavilion where his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) friend was pointing out Madame Karenina, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) mare.
<p/>Vronsky had not had time to look at the saddle, about which he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had to give some direction, when the competitors were summoned to the pavilion to receive their numbers and places in the row at starting.
<p/>Seventeen officers, looking serious and severe, many with pale faces, met together in the pavilion and drew the numbers.
<p/>Vronsky drew the number seven.
<p/>The cry was heard: <div class="bookquote">``Mount!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/>Feeling that with the others riding in the race, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was the center upon which all eyes were fastened, Vronsky walked up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mare in that state of nervous tension in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) usually became deliberate and composed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) movements.
<p/>Cord, in honor of the races, had put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) best clothes, a black coat buttoned up, a stiffly starched collar, which propped up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) cheeks, a round black hat, and top boots.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was calm and dignified as ever, and was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) own hands holding Frou-Frou by both reins, standing straight in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>).
<p/>Frou-Frou was still trembling as though in a fever.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) eye, full of fire, glanced sideways at Vronsky.
<p/>Vronsky slipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) finger under the saddle-girth.
<p/>The mare glanced aslant at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), drew up her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) lip, and twitched her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) ear.
<p/>The Englishman puckered up his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) lips, intending to indicate a smile that anyone should verify his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) saddling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get up; you won't feel so excited.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky looked round for the last time at his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) rivals.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) would not see them during the race.
<p/>Two were already riding forward to the point from which they were to start.
<p/>Galtsin, a friend of Vronsky's and one of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) more formidable rivals, was moving round a bay horse that would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mount.
<p/>A little light hussar in tight riding breeches rode off at a gallop, crouched up like a cat on the saddle, in imitation of English jockeys.
<p/>Prince Kuzovlev sat with a white face on his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) thoroughbred mare from the Grabovsky stud, while an English groom led her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) by the bridle.
<p/>Vronsky and all his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) comrades knew Kuzovlev and his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) peculiarity of <div class="bookquote">``weak nerves''  (<font color='red'><b>Kuzovlev</b></font>)</div>and terrible vanity.
<p/>They knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) was afraid of everything, afraid of riding a spirited horse.
<p/>But now, just because it was terrible, because people broke their necks, and there was a doctor standing at each obstacle, and an ambulance with a cross on it, and a sister of mercy, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) mind to take part in the race.
<p/>Their eyes met, and Vronsky gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) a friendly and encouraging nod.
<p/>Only one he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) did not see, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) chief rival, Mahotin on Gladiator.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be in a hurry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Cord to Vronsky, <div class="bookquote">``and remember one thing: don't hold her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in at the fences, and don't urge her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) on; let her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) go as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) likes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, taking the reins.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you can, lead the race; but don't lose heart till the last minute, even if you're behind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the mare</b></font>)</div><p/>Before the mare had time to move, Vronsky stepped with an agile, vigorous movement into the steel-toothed stirrup, and lightly and firmly seated himself on the creaking leather of the saddle.
<p/>Getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) right foot in the stirrup, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) smoothed the double reins, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) always did, between his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) fingers, and Cord let go.
<p/>As though she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) did not know which foot to put first, Frou-Frou started, dragging at the reins with her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) long neck, and as though she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) were on springs, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) rider from side to side.
<p/>Cord quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) step, following him (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>).
<p/>The excited mare, trying to shake off her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) rider first on one side and then the other, pulled at the reins, and Vronsky tried in vain with voice and hand to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>).
<p/>They were just reaching the dammed-up stream on their way to the starting point.
<p/>Several of the riders were in front and several behind, when suddenly Vronsky heard the sound of a horse galloping in the mud behind him (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) was overtaken by Mahotin on his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) white-legged, lop-eared Gladiator.
<p/>Mahotin smiled, showing his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) long teeth, but Vronsky looked angrily at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) did not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), and regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) now as his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) most formidable rival.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) for galloping past and exciting his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mare.
<p/>Frou-Frou started into a gallop, her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) left foot forward, made two bounds, and fretting at the tightened reins, passed into a jolting trot, bumping her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) rider up and down.
<p/>Cord, too, scowled, and followed Vronsky almost at a trot.
<p/>Chapter 25   There were seventeen officers in all riding in this race.
<p/>The race course was a large three-mile ring of the form of an ellipse in front of the pavilion.
<p/>On this course nine obstacles had been arranged: the stream, a big and solid barrier five feet high, just before the pavilion, a dry ditch, a ditch full of water, a precipitous slope, an Irish barricade -LRB-one of the most difficult obstacles, consisting of a mound fenced with brushwood, beyond which was a ditch out of sight for the horses, so that the horse had to clear both obstacles or might be killed-RRB-; then two more ditches filled with water, and one dry one; and the end of the race was just facing the pavilion.
<p/>But the race began not in the ring, but two hundred yards away from it, and in that part of the course was the first obstacle, a dammed-up stream, seven feet in breadth, which the racers could leap or wade through as they preferred.
<p/>Three times they were ranged ready to start, but each time some horse thrust itself out of line, and they had to begin again.
<p/>The umpire who was starting them, Colonel Sestrin, was beginning to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) temper, when at last for the fourth time he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) shouted <div class="bookquote">``Away!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>and the racers started.
<p/>Every eye, every opera glass, was turned on the brightly colored group of riders at the moment they were in line to start.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're off!
<p/>They're starting!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>was heard on all sides after the hush of expectation.
<p/>And little groups and solitary figures among the public began running from place to place to get a better view.
<p/>In the very first minute the close group of horsemen drew out, and it could be seen that they were approaching the stream in twos and threes and one behind another.
<p/>To the spectators it seemed as though they had all started simultaneously, but to the racers there were seconds of difference that had great value to them.
<p/>Frou-Frou, excited and over-nervous, had lost the first moment, and several horses had started before her (<font color='blue'><b>racers</b></font>), but before reaching the stream, Vronsky, who was holding in the mare with all his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) force as she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) tugged at the bridle, easily overtook three, and there were left in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) Mahotin's chestnut Gladiator, whose hind-quarters were moving lightly and rhythmically up and down exactly in front of Vronsky, and in front of all, the dainty mare Diana bearing Kuzovlev more dead than alive.
<p/>For the first instant Vronsky was not master either of himself or his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mare.
<p/>Up to the first obstacle, the stream, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could not guide the motions of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mare.
<p/>Gladiator and Diana came up to it together and almost at the same instant; simultaneously they rose above the stream and flew across to the other side; Frou-Frou darted after them, as if flying; but at the very moment when Vronsky felt himself in the air, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) suddenly saw almost under his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mare's hoofs Kuzovlev, who was floundering with Diana on the further side of the stream.
<p/>-LRB-Kuzovlev had let go the reins as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) took the leap, and the mare had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) flying over her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) head.-RRB-
<p/>Those details Vronsky learned later; at the moment all he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) saw was that just under him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), where Frou-Frou must alight, Diana's legs or head might be in the way.
<p/>But Frou-Frou drew up her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) legs and back in the very act of leaping, like a falling cat, and, clearing the other mare, alighted beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O the darling!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Vronsky.
<p/>After crossing the stream Vronsky had complete control of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mare, and began holding her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) in, intending to cross the great barrier behind Mahotin, and to try to overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) in the clear ground of about five hundred yards that followed it.
<p/>The great barrier stood just in front of the imperial pavilion.
<p/>The Tsar and the whole court and crowds of people were all gazing at them--at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tsar</b></font>), and Mahotin a length ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tsar</b></font>), as they drew near the <div class="bookquote">``devil,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>as the solid barrier was called.
<p/>Vronsky was aware of those eyes fastened upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) from all sides, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) saw nothing except the ears and neck of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) own mare, the ground racing to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), and the back and white legs of Gladiator beating time swiftly before him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), and keeping always the same distance ahead.
<p/>Gladiator rose, with no sound of knocking against anything.
<p/>With a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) short tail he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) disappeared from Vronsky's sight.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bravo!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>cried a voice.
<p/>At the same instant, under Vronsky's eyes, right before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) flashed the palings of the barrier.
<p/>Without the slightest change in her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) action his (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) mare flew over it; the palings vanished, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) heard only a crash behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>).
<p/>The mare, excited by Gladiator's keeping ahead, had risen too soon before the barrier, and grazed it with her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) hind hoofs.
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) pace never changed, and Vronsky, feeling a spatter of mud in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) face, realized that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) was once more the same distance from Gladiator.
<p/>Once more he (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) perceived in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) the same back and short tail, and again the same swiftly moving white legs that got no further away.
<p/>At the very moment when Vronsky thought that now was the time to overtake Mahotin, Frou-Frou herself, understanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) thoughts, without any incitement on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) part, gained ground considerably, and began getting alongside of Mahotin on the most favorable side, close to the inner cord.
<p/>Mahotin would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Mahotin</b></font>) pass that side.
<p/>Vronsky had hardly formed the thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) could perhaps pass on the outer side, when Frou-Frou shifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mahotin</b></font>) pace and began overtaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) on the other side.
<p/>Frou-Frou's shoulder, beginning by now to be dark with sweat, was even with Gladiator's back.
<p/>For a few lengths they moved evenly.
<p/>But before the obstacle they were approaching, Vronsky began working at the reins, anxious to avoid having to take the outer circle, and swiftly passed Mahotin just upon the declivity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) caught a glimpse of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) mud-stained face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) flashed by.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) even fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) smiled.
<p/>Vronsky passed Mahotin, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) was immediately aware of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) close upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) never ceased hearing the even-thudding hoofs and the rapid and still quite fresh breathing of Gladiator.
<p/>The next two obstacles, the water course and the barrier, were easily crossed, but Vronsky began to hear the snorting and thud of Gladiator closer upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) urged on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mare, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) delight felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) easily quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) pace, and the thud of Gladiator's hoofs was again heard at the same distance away.
<p/>Vronsky was at the head of the race, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) wanted to be and as Cord had advised, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) felt sure of being the winner.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) excitement, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) delight, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) tenderness for Frou-Frou grew keener and keener.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) longed to look round again, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) did not dare do this, and tried to be cool and not to urge on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) mare so to keep the same reserve of force in her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) felt that Gladiator still kept.
<p/>There remained only one obstacle, the most difficult; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) could cross it ahead of the others he (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) would come in first.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) was flying towards the Irish barricade, Frou-Frou and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) both together saw the barricade in the distance, and both the man and the mare had a moment's hesitation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the uncertainty in the mare's ears and lifted the whip, but at the same time felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fears were groundless; the mare knew what was wanted.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) pace and rose smoothly, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) would, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) left the ground gave herself up to the force of her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) rush, which carried her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) far beyond the ditch; and with the same rhythm, without effort, with the same leg forward, Frou-Frou fell back into her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) pace again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bravo, Vronsky!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) heard shouts from a knot of men--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) knew they were his (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) friends in the regiment--who were standing at the obstacle.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) could not fail to recognize Yashvin's voice though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O my sweet!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) said inwardly to Frou-Frou, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) listened for what was happening behind.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>)'s cleared it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) thought, catching the thud of Gladiator's hoofs behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>).
<p/>There remained only the last ditch, filled with water and five feet wide.
<p/>Vronsky did not even look at it, but anxious to get in a long way first began sawing away at the reins, lifting the mare's head and letting it go in time with her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) paces.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) felt that the mare was at her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) very last reserve of strength; not her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) neck and shoulders merely were wet, but the sweat was standing in drops on her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) mane, her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) head, her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) sharp ears, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) breath came in short, sharp gasps.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) had strength left more than enough for the remaining five hundred yards.
<p/>It was only from feeling himself nearer the ground and from the peculiar smoothness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gladiator</b></font>) motion that Vronsky knew how greatly the mare had quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) pace.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) flew over the ditch as though not noticing it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) flew over it like a bird; but at the same instant Vronsky, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) horror, felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had failed to keep up with the mare's pace, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) did not know how, made a fearful, unpardonable mistake, in recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) seat in the saddle.
<p/>All at once his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) position had shifted and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) knew that something awful had happened.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) could not yet make out what had happened, when the white legs of a chestnut horse flashed by close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), and Mahotin passed at a swift gallop.
<p/>Vronsky was touching the ground with one foot, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mare was sinking on that foot.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) just had time to free his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) leg when she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) fell on one side, gasping painfully, and, making vain efforts to rise with her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) delicate, soaking neck, she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) fluttered on the ground at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) feet like a shot bird.
<p/>The clumsy movement made by Vronsky had broken her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) back.
<p/>But that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) only knew much later.
<p/>At that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) knew only that Mahotin had flown swiftly by, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) stood staggering alone on the muddy, motionless ground, and Frou-Frou lay gasping before him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), bending her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) head back and gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) exquisite eyes.
<p/>Still unable to realize what had happened, Vronsky tugged at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mare's reins.
<p/>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) struggled all over like a fish, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) shoulders setting the saddle heaving, she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) rose on her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) front legs but unable to lift her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) back, she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) quivered all over and again fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) side.
<p/>With a face hideous with passion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) lower jaw trembling, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) cheeks white, Vronsky kicked her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) heel in the stomach and again fell to tugging at the rein.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) did not stir, but thrusting her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) nose into the ground, she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) simply gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) master with her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) speaking eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A--a--a!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>groaned Vronsky, clutching at his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>what have I done!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The race lost!
<p/>And my fault!
<p/>shameful, unpardonable!
<p/>And the poor darling, ruined mare!
<p/>Ah!
<p/>what have I done!''
 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>A crowd of men, a doctor and his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) assistant, the officers of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) regiment, ran up to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<p/>To his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) misery he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was whole and unhurt.
<p/>The mare had broken her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) back, and it was decided to shoot her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>).
<p/>Vronsky could not answer questions, could not speak to anyone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) turned, and without picking up his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cap that had fallen off, walked away from the race course, not knowing where he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was going.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) felt utterly wretched.
<p/>For the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) knew the bitterest sort of misfortune, misfortune beyond remedy, and caused by his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) own fault.
<p/>Yashvin overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) cap, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) home, and half an hour later Vronsky had regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) self-possession.
<p/>But the memory of that race remained for long in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) heart, the cruelest and bitterest memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) life.
<p/>Chapter 26   The external relations of Alexey Alexandrovitch and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife had remained unchanged.
<p/>The sole difference lay in the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was more busily occupied than ever.
<p/>As in former years, at the beginning of the spring he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had gone to a foreign watering-place for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) health, deranged by the winter's work that every year grew heavier.
<p/>And just as always he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) returned in July and at once fell to work as usual with increased energy.
<p/>As usual, too, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife had moved for the summer to a villa out of town, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) remained in Petersburg.
<p/>From the date of their conversation after the party at Princess Tverskaya's he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had never spoken again to Anna of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) suspicions and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) jealousies, and that habitual tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) bantering mimicry was the most convenient tone possible for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) present attitude to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was a little colder to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) simply seemed to be slightly displeased with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for that first midnight conversation, which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had repelled.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) attitude to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) there was a shade of vexation, but nothing more.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not be open with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) seemed to say, mentally addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``so much the worse for you.
<p/>Now you may beg as you please, but I won't be open with you.
<p/>So much the worse for you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said mentally, like a man who, after vainly attempting to extinguish a fire, should fly in a rage with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) vain efforts and say, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well then!
<p/>you shall burn for this!''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>This man, so subtle and astute in official life, did not realize all the senselessness of such an attitude to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not realize it, because it was too terrible to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to realize his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) actual position, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shut down and locked and sealed up in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart that secret place where lay hid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feelings towards his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family, that is, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and son.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who had been such a careful father, had from the end of that winter become peculiarly frigid to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son, and adopted to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) just the same bantering tone he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha, young man!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>was the greeting with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch asserted and believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had never in any previous year had so much official business as that year.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was not aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sought work for himself that year, that this was one of the means for keeping shut that secret place where lay hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) feelings towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife and son and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) thoughts about them, which became more terrible the longer they lay there.
<p/>If anyone had had the right to ask Alexey Alexandrovitch what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife's behavior, the mild and peaceable Alexey Alexandrovitch would have made no answer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would have been greatly angered with any man who should question him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) on that subject.
<p/>For this reason there positively came into Alexey Alexandrovitch's face a look of haughtiness and severity whenever anyone inquired after his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife's health.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch did not want to think at all about his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife's behavior, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) actually succeeded in not thinking about it at all.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch's permanent summer villa was in Peterhof, and the Countess Lidia Ivanovna used as a rule to spend the summer there, close to Anna, and constantly seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>That year Countess Lidia Ivanovna declined to settle in Peterhof, was not once at Anna Arkadyevna's, and in conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch hinted at the unsuitability of Anna's close intimacy with Betsy and Vronsky.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch sternly cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) short, roundly declaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife to be above suspicion, and from that time began to avoid Countess Lidia Ivanovna.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not want to see, and did not see, that many people in society cast dubious glances on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not want to understand, and did not understand, why his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife had so particularly insisted on staying at Tsarskoe, where Betsy was staying, and not far from the camp of Vronsky's regiment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not allow himself to think about it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not think about it; but all the same though he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) never admitted it to himself, and had no proofs, not even suspicious evidence, in the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knew beyond all doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was a deceived husband, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was profoundly miserable about it.
<p/>How often during those eight years of happy life with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife Alexey Alexandrovitch had looked at other men's faithless wives and other deceived husbands and asked himself:  <div class="bookquote">``How can people descend to that?
<p/>how is it they don't put an end to such a hideous position?''
 (<font color='red'><b>husbands</b></font>)</div><p/>But now, when the misfortune had come upon himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was so far from thinking of putting an end to the position that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would not recognize it at all, would not recognize it just because it was too awful, too unnatural.
<p/>Since his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) return from abroad Alexey Alexandrovitch had twice been at their country villa.
<p/>Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) dined there, another time he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) spent the evening there with a party of friends, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had not once stayed the night there, as it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) habit to do in previous years.
<p/>The day of the races had been a very busy day for Alexey Alexandrovitch; but when mentally sketching out the day in the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) mind to go to their country house to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife immediately after dinner, and from there to the races, which all the Court were to witness, and at which he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was bound to be present.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was going to see his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) wife, because he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had determined to see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) once a week to keep up appearances.
<p/>And besides, on that day, as it was the fifteenth, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had to give his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) wife some money for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) expenses, according to their usual arrangement.
<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) habitual control over his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) thoughts, though he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) thought all this about his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) did not let his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) thoughts stray further in regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>That morning was a very full one for Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>The evening before, Countess Lidia Ivanovna had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) a pamphlet by a celebrated traveler in China, who was staying in Petersburg, and with it she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) enclosed a note begging him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to see the traveler himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was an extremely interesting person from various points of view, and likely to be useful.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch had not had time to read the pamphlet through in the evening, and finished it in the morning.
<p/>Then people began arriving with petitions, and there came the reports, interviews, appointments, dismissals, apportionment of rewards, pensions, grants, notes, the workaday round, as Alexey Alexandrovitch called it, that always took up so much time.
<p/>Then there was private business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own, a visit from the doctor and the steward who managed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) property.
<p/>The steward did not take up much time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) simply gave Alexey Alexandrovitch the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) needed together with a brief statement of the position of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) affairs, which was not altogether satisfactory, as it had happened that during that year, owing to increased expenses, more had been paid out than usual, and there was a deficit.
<p/>But the doctor, a celebrated Petersburg doctor, who was an intimate acquaintance of Alexey Alexandrovitch, took up a great deal of time.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch had not expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) that day, and was surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) visit, and still more so when the doctor questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) very carefully about his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) health, listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) breathing, and tapped at his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) liver.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch did not know that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) friend Lidia Ivanovna, noticing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was not as well as usual that year, had begged the doctor to go and examine him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do this for my sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div>the Countess Lidia Ivanovna had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do it for the sake of Russia, countess,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A priceless man!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div><p/>said the Countess Lidia Ivanovna.
<p/>The doctor was extremely dissatisfied with Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) found the liver considerably enlarged, and the digestive powers weakened, while the course of mineral waters had been quite without effect.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) prescribed more physical exercise as far as possible, and as far as possible less mental strain, and above all no worry--in other words, just what was as much out of Alexey Alexandrovitch's power as abstaining from breathing.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) withdrew, leaving in Alexey Alexandrovitch an unpleasant sense that something was wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and that there was no chance of curing it.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was coming away, the doctor chanced to meet on the staircase an acquaintance of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), Sludin, who was secretary of Alexey Alexandrovitch's department.
<p/>They had been comrades at the university, and though they rarely met, they thought highly of each other and were excellent friends, and so there was no one to whom the doctor would have given his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) opinion of a patient so freely as to Sludin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How glad I am you've been seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sludin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Sludin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s not well, and I fancy....  Well, what do you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, beckoning over Sludin's head to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) coachman to bring the carriage round.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just this,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, taking a finger of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) kid glove in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) white hands and pulling it, <div class="bookquote">``if you don't strain the strings, and then try to break them, you'll find it a difficult job; but strain a string to its very utmost, and the mere weight of one finger on the strained string will snap it.
<p/>And with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) close assiduity, his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) conscientious devotion to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) work, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s strained to the utmost; and there's some outside burden weighing on him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), and not a light one,''  (<font color='red'><b>kid</b></font>)</div>concluded the doctor, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eyebrows significantly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you be at the races?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) added, as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sank into his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) seat in the carriage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, to be sure; it does waste a lot of time,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>the doctor responded vaguely to some reply of Sludin's he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had not caught.
<p/>Directly after the doctor, who had taken up so much time, came the celebrated traveler, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, by means of the pamphlet he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had only just finished reading and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) previous acquaintance with the subject, impressed the traveler by the depth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knowledge of the subject and the breadth and enlightenment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) view of it.
<p/>At the same time as the traveler there was announced a provincial marshal of nobility on a visit to Petersburg, with whom Alexey Alexandrovitch had to have some conversation.
<p/>After his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) departure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had to finish the daily routine of business with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) secretary, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) still had to drive round to call on a certain great personage on a matter of grave and serious import.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch only just managed to be back by five o'clock, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) dinner-hour, and after dining with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) secretary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to drive with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) country villa and to the races.
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not acknowledge it to himself, Alexey Alexandrovitch always tried nowadays to secure the presence of a third person in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) interviews with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife.
<p/>Chapter 27   Anna was upstairs, standing before the looking glass, and, with Annushka's assistance, pinning the last ribbon on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) gown when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heard carriage wheels crunching the gravel at the entrance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's too early for Betsy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) thought, and glancing out of the window she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) caught sight of the carriage and the black hat of Alexey Alexandrovitch, and the ears that she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) knew so well sticking up each side of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How unlucky!
<p/>Can he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) be going to stay the night?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) wondered, and the thought of all that might come of such a chance struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) as so awful and terrible that, without dwelling on it for a moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) went down to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) with a bright and radiant face; and conscious of the presence of that spirit of falsehood and deceit in herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) had come to know of late, she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) abandoned herself to that spirit and began talking, hardly knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) was saying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, how nice of you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) said, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) husband her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) hand, and greeting Sludin, who was like one of the family, with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're staying the night, I hope?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>was the first word the spirit of falsehood prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) to utter; <div class="bookquote">``and now we'll go together.
<p/>Only it's a pity I've promised Betsy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>)'s coming for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch knit his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brows at Betsy's name.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm not going to separate the inseparables,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) usual bantering tone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going with Mihail Vassilievitch.
<p/>I'm ordered exercise by the doctors too.
<p/>I'll walk, and fancy myself at the springs again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no hurry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you like tea?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) rang.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring in tea, and tell Seryozha that Alexey Alexandrovitch is here.
<p/>Well, tell me, how have you been?
<p/>Mihail Vassilievitch, you've not been to see me before.
<p/>Look how lovely it is out on the terrace,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, turning first to one and then to the other.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) spoke very simply and naturally, but too much and too fast.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was the more aware of this from noticing in the inquisitive look Mihail Vassilievitch turned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was, as it were, keeping watch on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Mihail Vassilievitch promptly went out on the terrace.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sat down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't look quite well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``the doctor's been with me today and wasted an hour of my time.
<p/>I feel that some one of our friends must have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>): my health's so precious, it seems.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; what did he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) health and what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been doing, and tried to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to take a rest and come out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>All this she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said brightly, rapidly, and with a peculiar brilliance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>But Alexey Alexandrovitch did not now attach any special significance to this tone of hers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) heard only her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) words and gave them only the direct sense they bore.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) answered simply, though jestingly.
<p/>There was nothing remarkable in all this conversation, but never after could Anna recall this brief scene without an agonizing pang of shame.
<p/>Seryozha came in preceded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) governess.
<p/>If Alexey Alexandrovitch had allowed himself to observe he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would have noticed the timid and bewildered eyes with which Seryozha glanced first at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) father and then at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) mother.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would not see anything, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not see it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, the young man!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)'s grown.
<p/>Really, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)'s getting quite a man.
<p/>How are you, young man?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand to the scared child.
<p/>Seryozha had been shy of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father before, and now, ever since Alexey Alexandrovitch had taken to calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) young man, and since that insoluble question had occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) whether Vronsky were a friend or a foe, he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) avoided his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) father.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) looked round towards his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) mother as though seeking shelter.
<p/>It was only with his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) mother that he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) was at ease.
<p/>Meanwhile, Alexey Alexandrovitch was holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) son by the shoulder while he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was speaking to the governess, and Seryozha was so miserably uncomfortable that Anna saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was on the point of tears.
<p/>Anna, who had flushed a little the instant her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son came in, noticing that Seryozha was uncomfortable, got up hurriedly, took Alexey Alexandrovitch's hand from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son's shoulder, and kissing the boy, led him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) out onto the terrace, and quickly came back.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's time to start, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), glancing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) watch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is it Betsy doesn't come?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch, and getting up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hands and cracked his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) fingers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come to bring you some money, too, for nightingales, we know, can't live on fairy tales,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You want it, I expect?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't...yes, I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) said, not looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and crimsoning to the roots of her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) hair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you'll come back here after the races, I suppose?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>answered Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And here's the glory of Peterhof, Princess Tverskaya,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) added, looking out of the window at the elegant English carriage with the tiny seats placed extremely high.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What elegance!
<p/>Charming!
<p/>Well, let us be starting too, then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>Princess Tverskaya did not get out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) carriage, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) groom, in high boots, a cape, and black hat, darted out at the entrance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going; good-bye!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna, and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went up to Alexey Alexandrovitch and held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was ever so nice of you to come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,  au revoir , then!
<p/>You'll come back for some tea; that's delightful!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, and went out, gay and radiant.
<p/>But as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) no longer saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was aware of the spot on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) lips had touched, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) shuddered with repulsion.
<p/>Chapter 28   When Alexey Alexandrovitch reached the race-course, Anna was already sitting in the pavilion beside Betsy, in that pavilion where all the highest society had gathered.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) caught sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) husband in the distance.
<p/>Two men, her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) lover, were the two centers of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) existence, and unaided by her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) external senses she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) was aware of their nearness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) was aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) husband approaching a long way off, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) could not help following him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in the surging crowd in the midst of which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was moving.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) progress towards the pavilion, saw him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) now responding condescendingly to an ingratiating bow, now exchanging friendly, nonchalant greetings with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) equals, now assiduously trying to catch the eye of some great one of this world, and taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) big round hat that squeezed the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ears.
<p/>All these ways of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) knew, and all were hateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing but ambition, nothing but the desire to get on, that's all there is in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``as for these lofty ideals, love of culture, religion, they are only so many tools for getting on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) glances towards the ladies' pavilion -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was staring straight at her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>), but did not distinguish his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife in the sea of muslin, ribbons, feathers, parasols and flowers-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) purposely avoided noticing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexey Alexandrovitch!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>Princess Betsy called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you don't see your wife:  here she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) smiled his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) chilly smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's so much splendor here that one's eyes are dazzled,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went into the pavilion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) smiled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife as a man should smile on meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife after only just parting from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and greeted the princess and other acquaintances, giving to each what was due--that is to say, jesting with the ladies and dealing out friendly greetings among the men.
<p/>Below, near the pavilion, was standing an adjutant-general of whom Alexey Alexandrovitch had a high opinion, noted for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) intelligence and culture.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch entered into conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>There was an interval between the races, and so nothing hindered conversation.
<p/>The adjutant-general expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) disapproval of races.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch replied defending them.
<p/>Anna heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) high, measured tones, not losing one word, and every word struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as false, and stabbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ears with pain.
<p/>When the three-mile steeplechase was beginning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bent forward and gazed with fixed eyes at Vronsky as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) horse and mounted, and at the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heard that loathsome, never-ceasing voice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was in an agony of terror for Vronsky, but a still greater agony was the never-ceasing, as it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), stream of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband's shrill voice with its familiar intonations.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm a wicked woman, a lost woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``but I don't like lying, I can't endure falsehood, while as for  him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)  -LRB-her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband-RRB- it's the breath of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) life--falsehood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knows all about it, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sees it all; what does he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) care if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) can talk so calmly?
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were to kill me, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were to kill Vronsky, I might respect him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>No, all he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wants is falsehood and propriety,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Anna said to herself, not considering exactly what it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wanted of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would have liked to see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) behave.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not understand either that Alexey Alexandrovitch's peculiar loquacity that day, so exasperating to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), was merely the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) inward distress and uneasiness.
<p/>As a child that has been hurt skips about, putting all his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) muscles into movement to drown the pain, in the same way Alexey Alexandrovitch needed mental exercise to drown the thoughts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife that in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) presence and in Vronsky's, and with the continual iteration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) name, would force themselves on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) attention.
<p/>And it was as natural for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to talk well and cleverly, as it is natural for a child to skip about.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was saying:  <div class="bookquote">``Danger in the races of officers, of cavalry men, is an essential element in the race.
<p/>If England can point to the most brilliant feats of cavalry in military history, it is simply owing to the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has historically developed this force both in beasts and in men.
<p/>Sport has, in my opinion, a great value, and as is always the case, we see nothing but what is most superficial.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not superficial,''  (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div>said Princess Tverskaya.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One of the officers, they say, has broken two ribs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) smile, which uncovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) teeth, but revealed nothing more.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll admit, princess, that that's not superficial,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but internal.
<p/>But that's not the point,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) turned again to the general with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was talking seriously; <div class="bookquote">``we mustn't forget that those who are taking part in the race are military men, who have chosen that career, and one must allow that every calling has its disagreeable side.
<p/>It forms an integral part of the duties of an officer.
<p/>Low sports, such as prize-fighting or Spanish bull-fights, are a sign of barbarity.
<p/>But specialized trials of skill are a sign of development.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I shan't come another time; it's too upsetting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div>said Princess Betsy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it, Anna?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is upsetting, but one can't tear oneself away,''  (<font color='red'><b>another lady</b></font>)</div>said another lady.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I'd been a Roman woman I should never have missed a single circus.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna said nothing, and keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) opera glass up, gazed always at the same spot.
<p/>At that moment a tall general walked through the pavilion.
<p/>Breaking off what he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was saying, Alexey Alexandrovitch got up hurriedly, though with dignity, and bowed low to the general.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not racing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div><p/>the officer asked, chaffing him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My race is a harder one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch responded deferentially.
<p/>And though the answer meant nothing, the general looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had heard a witty remark from a witty man, and fully relished la pointe de la sauce .
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are two aspects,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch resumed: <div class="bookquote">``those who take part and those who look on; and love for such spectacles is an unmistakable proof of a low degree of development in the spectator, I admit, but...''   (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Princess, bets!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>sounded Stepan Arkadyevitch's voice from below, addressing Betsy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's your favorite?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna and I are for Kuzovlev,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>replied Betsy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm for Vronsky.
<p/>A pair of gloves?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Done!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is a pretty sight, isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch paused while there was talking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) began again directly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I admit that manly sports do not...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was continuing.
<p/>But at that moment the racers started, and all conversation ceased.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch too was silent, and everyone stood up and turned towards the stream.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch took no interest in the race, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not watch the racers, but fell listlessly to scanning the spectators with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) weary eyes.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes rested upon Anna.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face was white and set.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was obviously seeing nothing and no one but one man.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand had convulsively clutched her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fan, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) breath.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and hastily turned away, scrutinizing other faces.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But here's this lady too, and others very much moved as well; it's very natural,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) tried not to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), but unconsciously his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes were drawn to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) examined that face again, trying not to read what was so plainly written on it, and against his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own will, with horror read on it what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not want to know.
<p/>The first fall--Kuzovlev's, at the stream--agitated everyone, but Alexey Alexandrovitch saw distinctly on Anna's pale, triumphant face that the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was watching had not fallen.
<p/>When, after Mahotin and Vronsky had cleared the worst barrier, the next officer had been thrown straight on his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) head at it and fatally injured, and a shudder of horror passed over the whole public, Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that Anna did not even notice it, and had some difficulty in realizing what they were talking of about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>But more and more often, and with greater persistence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Anna, wholly engrossed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was with the race, became aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband's cold eyes fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) from one side.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) glanced round for an instant, looked inquiringly at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and with a slight frown turned away again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I don't care!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) seemed to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not once glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) again.
<p/>The race was an unlucky one, and of the seventeen officers who rode in it more than half were thrown and hurt.
<p/>Towards the end of the race everyone was in a state of agitation, which was intensified by the fact that the Tsar was displeased.
<p/>Chapter 29   Everyone was loudly expressing disapprobation, everyone was repeating a phrase some one had uttered--<div class="bookquote">``The lions and gladiators will be the next thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div>and everyone was feeling horrified; so that when Vronsky fell to the ground, and Anna moaned aloud, there was nothing very out of the way in it.
<p/>But afterwards a change came over Anna's face which really was beyond decorum.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) utterly lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) began fluttering like a caged bird, at one moment would have got up and moved away, at the next turned to Betsy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go, let us go!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) said.
<p/>But Betsy did not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) was bending down, talking to a general who had come up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>).
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch went up to Anna and courteously offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) arm.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go, if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said in French, but Anna was listening to the general and did not notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s broken his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) leg too, so they say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the general</b></font>)</div>the general was saying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is beyond everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>Without answering her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband, Anna lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) opera glass and gazed towards the place where Vronsky had fallen; but it was so far off, and there was such a crowd of people about it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could make out nothing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) laid down the opera glass, and would have moved away, but at that moment an officer galloped up and made some announcement to the Tsar.
<p/>Anna craned forward, listening.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stiva!
<p/>Stiva!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cried to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) brother.
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) brother did not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would have moved away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Once more I offer you my arm if you want to be going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch, reaching towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) drew back from him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) with aversion, and without looking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face answered:  <div class="bookquote">``No, no, let me be, I'll stay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw now that from the place of Vronsky's accident an officer was running across the course towards the pavilion.
<p/>Betsy waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) handkerchief to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>).
<p/>The officer brought the news that the rider was not killed, but the horse had broken its back.
<p/>On hearing this Anna sat down hurriedly, and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fan.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was weeping, and could not control her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tears, nor even the sobs that were shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bosom.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch stood so as to screen her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) time to recover herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For the third time I offer you my arm,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) after a little time, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Anna gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) and did not know what to say.
<p/>Princess Betsy came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) rescue.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Alexey Alexandrovitch; I brought Anna and I promised to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>put in Betsy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, princess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, smiling courteously but looking her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) very firmly in the face, <div class="bookquote">``but I see that Anna's not very well, and I wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to come home with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in a frightened way, got up submissively, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband's arm.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll send to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and find out, and let you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>Betsy whispered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>).
<p/>As they left the pavilion, Alexey Alexandrovitch, as always, talked to those he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) met, and Anna had, as always, to talk and answer; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was utterly beside herself, and moved hanging on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband's arm as though in a dream.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) killed or not?
<p/>Is it true?
<p/>Will he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) come or not?
<p/>Shall I see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) today?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was thinking.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) seat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband's carriage in silence, and in silence drove out of the crowd of carriages.
<p/>In spite of all he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had seen, Alexey Alexandrovitch still did not allow himself to consider his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife's real condition.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) merely saw the outward symptoms.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was behaving unbecomingly, and considered it his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) duty to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) so.
<p/>But it was very difficult for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) not to say more, to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nothing but that.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) mouth to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had behaved unbecomingly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not help saying something utterly different.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What an inclination we all have, though, for these cruel spectacles,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I observe...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Eh?
<p/>I don't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna contemptuously.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was offended, and at once began to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had meant to say.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am obliged to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) began.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So now we are to have it out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt frightened.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am obliged to tell you that your behavior has been unbecoming today,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in French.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way has my behavior been unbecoming?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said aloud, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head swiftly and looking him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) straight in the face, not with the bright expression that seemed covering something, but with a look of determination, under which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) concealed with difficulty the dismay she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was feeling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, pointing to the open window opposite the coachman.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) got up and pulled up the window.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you consider unbecoming?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) repeated.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The despair you were unable to conceal at the accident to one of the riders.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to answer, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was silent, looking straight before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have already begged you so to conduct yourself in society that even malicious tongues can find nothing to say against you.
<p/>There was a time when I spoke of your inward attitude, but I am not speaking of that now.
<p/>Now I speak only of your external attitude.
<p/>You have behaved improperly, and I would wish it not to occur again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not hear half of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was saying; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt panic-stricken before him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and was thinking whether it was true that Vronsky was not killed.
<p/>Was it of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) they were speaking when they said the rider was unhurt, but the horse had broken its back?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) merely smiled with a pretense of irony when he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) finished, and made no reply, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not heard what he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) said.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch had begun to speak boldly, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) realized plainly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was speaking of, the dismay she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was feeling infected him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) too.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw the smile, and a strange misapprehension came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is smiling at my suspicions.
<p/>Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) will tell me directly what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) told me before; that there is no foundation for my suspicions, that it's absurd.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment, when the revelation of everything was hanging over him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), there was nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) expected so much as that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would answer mockingly as before that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) suspicions were absurd and utterly groundless.
<p/>So terrible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knew that now he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was ready to believe anything.
<p/>But the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face, scared and gloomy, did not now promise even deception.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly I was mistaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If so, I beg your pardon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you were not mistaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said deliberately, looking desperately into his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) cold face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were not mistaken.
<p/>I was, and I could not help being in despair.
<p/>I hear you, but I am thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) mistress; I can't bear you; I'm afraid of you, and I hate you....  You can do what you like to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And dropping back into the corner of the carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) broke into sobs, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch did not stir, and kept looking straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) whole face suddenly bore the solemn rigidity of the dead, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) expression did not change during the whole time of the drive home.
<p/>On reaching the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), still with the same expression.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well!
<p/>But I expect a strict observance of the external forms of propriety till such time'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>--his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) voice shook--<div class="bookquote">``as I may take measures to secure my honor and communicate them to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) got out first and helped her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to get out.
<p/>Before the servants he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hand, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) seat in the carriage, and drove back to Petersburg.
<p/>Immediately afterwards a footman came from Princess Betsy and brought Anna a note.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I sent to Alexey to find out how he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) is, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) writes me he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) is quite well and unhurt, but in despair.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So  he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>)  will be here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought.

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) watch.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had still three hours to wait, and the memories of their last meeting set her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) blood in flame.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My God, how light it is!

<p/>everything's over with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 30   In the little German watering-place to which the Shtcherbatskys had betaken themselves, as in all places indeed where people are gathered together, the usual process, as it were, of the crystallization of society went on, assigning to each member of that society a definite and unalterable place.
<p/>Just as the particle of water in frost, definitely and unalterably, takes the special form of the crystal of snow, so each new person that arrived at the springs was at once placed in his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) special place.
<p/>F√ºrst  Shtcherbatsky,  sammt Gemahlin und Tochter , by the apartments they took, and from their name and from the friends they made, were immediately crystallized into a definite place marked out for them.
<p/>There was visiting the watering-place that year a real German F√ºrstin, in consequence of which the crystallizing process went on more vigorously than ever.
<p/>Princess Shtcherbatskaya wished, above everything, to present her (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) daughter to this German princess, and the day after their arrival she (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) duly performed this rite.
<p/>Kitty made a low and graceful curtsey in the  very simple , that is to say, very elegant frock that had been ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) from Paris.
<p/>The German princess said, <div class="bookquote">``I hope the roses will soon come back to this pretty little face,''  (<font color='red'><b>The princess</b></font>)</div>and for the Shtcherbatskys certain definite lines of existence were at once laid down from which there was no departing.
<p/>The Shtcherbatskys made the acquaintance too of the family of an English Lady Somebody, and of a German countess and her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) son, wounded in the last war, and of a learned Swede, and of M. Canut and his (<font color='blue'><b>Swede</b></font>) sister.
<p/>But yet inevitably the Shtcherbatskys were thrown most into the society of a Moscow lady, Marya Yevgenyevna Rtishtcheva and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter, whom Kitty disliked, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had fallen ill, like herself, over a love affair, and a Moscow colonel, whom Kitty had known from childhood, and always seen in uniform and epaulets, and who now, with his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) little eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) open neck and flowered cravat, was uncommonly ridiculous and tedious, because there was no getting rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>).
<p/>When all this was so firmly established, Kitty began to be very much bored, especially as the prince went away to Carlsbad and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was left alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) took no interest in the people she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knew, feeling that nothing fresh would come of them.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) chief mental interest in the watering-place consisted in watching and making theories about the people she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not know.
<p/>It was characteristic of Kitty that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) always imagined everything in people in the most favorable light possible, especially so in those she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not know.
<p/>And now as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) made surmises as to who people were, what were their relations to one another, and what they were like, Kitty endowed them with the most marvelous and noble characters, and found confirmation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) idea in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) observations.
<p/>Of these people the one that attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) most was a Russian girl who had come to the watering-place with an invalid Russian lady, Madame Stahl, as everyone called her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>Madame Stahl belonged to the highest society, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so ill that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not walk, and only on exceptionally fine days made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appearance at the springs in an invalid carriage.
<p/>But it was not so much from ill-health as from pride--so Princess Shtcherbatskaya interpreted it--that Madame Stahl had not made the acquaintance of anyone among the Russians there.
<p/>The Russian girl looked after Madame Stahl, and besides that, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was, as Kitty observed, on friendly terms with all the invalids who were seriously ill, and there were many of them at the springs, and looked after them in the most natural way.
<p/>This Russian girl was not, as Kitty gathered, related to Madame Stahl, nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) a paid attendant.
<p/>Madame Stahl called her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) Varenka, and other people called her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle Varenka.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Apart from the interest Kitty took in this girl's relations with Madame Stahl and with other unknown persons, Kitty, as often happened, felt an inexplicable attraction to Mademoiselle Varenka, and was aware when their eyes met that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) too liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>Of Mademoiselle Varenka one would not say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) first youth, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was, as it were, a creature without youth; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) might have been taken for nineteen or for thirty.
<p/>If her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) features were criticized separately, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was handsome rather than plain, in spite of the sickly hue of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) would have been a good figure, too, if it had not been for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) extreme thinness and the size of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) head, which was too large for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) medium height.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was not likely to be attractive to men.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was like a fine flower, already past its bloom and without fragrance, though the petals were still unwithered.
<p/>Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) would have been unattractive to men also from the lack of just what Kitty had too much of--of the suppressed fire of vitality, and the consciousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own attractiveness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) always seemed absorbed in work about which there could be no doubt, and so it seemed she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not take interest in anything outside it.
<p/>It was just this contrast with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own position that was for Kitty the great attraction of Mademoiselle Varenka.
<p/>Kitty felt that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) manner of life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) would find an example of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was now so painfully seeking: interest in life, a dignity in life--apart from the worldly relations of girls with men, which so revolted Kitty, and appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) now as a shameful hawking about of goods in search of a purchaser.
<p/>The more attentively Kitty watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) unknown friend, the more convinced she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was this girl was the perfect creature she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) fancied her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and the more eagerly she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wished to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) acquaintance.
<p/>The two girls used to meet several times a day, and every time they met, Kitty's eyes said:  <div class="bookquote">``Who are you?
<p/>What are you?
<p/>Are you really the exquisite creature I imagine you to be?
<p/>But for goodness' sake don't suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes added, <div class="bookquote">``that I would force my acquaintance on you, I simply admire you and like you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like you too, and you're very, very sweet.
<p/>And I should like you better still, if I had time,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>answered the eyes of the unknown girl.
<p/>Kitty saw indeed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was always busy.
<p/>Either she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was taking the children of a Russian family home from the springs, or fetching a shawl for a sick lady, and wrapping her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) up in it, or trying to interest an irritable invalid, or selecting and buying cakes for tea for someone.
<p/>Soon after the arrival of the Shtcherbatskys there appeared in the morning crowd at the springs two persons who attracted universal and unfavorable attention.
<p/>These were a tall man with a stooping figure, and huge hands, in an old coat too short for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with black, simple, and yet terrible eyes, and a pockmarked, kind-looking woman, very badly and tastelessly dressed.
<p/>Recognizing these persons as Russians, Kitty had already in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) imagination begun constructing a delightful and touching romance about them.
<p/>But the princess, having ascertained from the visitors' list that this was Nikolay Levin and Marya Nikolaevna, explained to Kitty what a bad man this Levin was, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) fancies about these two people vanished.
<p/>Not so much from what her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), as from the fact that it was Konstantin's brother, this pair suddenly seemed to Kitty intensely unpleasant.
<p/>This Levin, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) continual twitching of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head, aroused in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) now an irrepressible feeling of disgust.
<p/>It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) big, terrible eyes, which persistently pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), expressed a feeling of hatred and contempt, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) tried to avoid meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 31   It was a wet day; it had been raining all the morning, and the invalids, with their parasols, had flocked into the arcades.
<p/>Kitty was walking there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother and the Moscow colonel, smart and jaunty in his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) European coat, bought ready-made at Frankfort.
<p/>They were walking on one side of the arcade, trying to avoid Levin, who was walking on the other side.
<p/>Varenka, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) dark dress, in a black hat with a turn-down brim, was walking up and down the whole length of the arcade with a blind Frenchwoman, and, every time she (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) met Kitty, they exchanged friendly glances.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, couldn't I speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Kitty, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) unknown friend, and noticing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was going up to the spring, and that they might come there together.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you want to so much, I'll find out about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) first and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) acquaintance myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you see in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) out of the way?
<p/>A companion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) must be.
<p/>If you like, I'll make acquaintance with Madame Stahl; I used to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)  belle-soeur ,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>added the princess, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) head haughtily.
<p/>Kitty knew that the princess was offended that Madame Stahl had seemed to avoid making her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) acquaintance.
<p/>Kitty did not insist.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How wonderfully sweet she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, gazing at Varenka just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) handed a glass to the Frenchwoman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look how natural and sweet it all is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's so funny to see your  engouements ,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, we'd better go back,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) added, noticing Levin coming towards them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) companion and a German doctor, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was talking very noisily and angrily.
<p/>They turned to go back, when suddenly they heard, not noisy talk, but shouting.
<p/>Levin, stopping short, was shouting at the doctor, and the doctor, too, was excited.
<p/>A crowd gathered about them.
<p/>The princess and Kitty beat a hasty retreat, while the colonel joined the crowd to find out what was the matter.
<p/>A few minutes later the colonel overtook them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>inquired the princess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scandalous and disgraceful!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>answered the colonel.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The one thing to be dreaded is meeting Russians abroad.
<p/>That tall gentleman was abusing the doctor, flinging all sorts of insults at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wasn't treating him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) quite as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) liked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) began waving his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) stick at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<p/>It's simply a scandal!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how unpleasant!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>said the princess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and how did it end?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Luckily at that point that...the one in the mushroom hat... intervened.
<p/>A Russian lady, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the colonel</b></font>)</div>said the colonel.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle Varenka?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) came to the rescue before anyone; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) took the man by the arm and led him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty; <div class="bookquote">``you wonder that I'm enthusiastic about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) unknown friend, Kitty noticed that Mademoiselle Varenka was already on the same terms with Levin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) companion as with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) other  prot√©g√©s .
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) went up to them, entered into conversation with them, and served as interpreter for the woman, who could not speak any foreign language.
<p/>Kitty began to entreat her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother still more urgently to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) make friends with Varenka.
<p/>And, disagreeable as it was to the princess to seem to take the first step in wishing to make the acquaintance of Madame Stahl, who thought fit to give herself airs, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) made inquiries about Varenka, and, having ascertained particulars about her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) tending to prove that there could be no harm though little good in the acquaintance, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) herself approached Varenka and made acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).
<p/>Choosing a time when her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) daughter had gone to the spring, while Varenka had stopped outside the baker's, the princess went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Allow me to make your acquaintance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) said, with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) dignified smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My daughter has lost her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) heart to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly you do not know me.
<p/>I am...''   (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That feeling is more than reciprocal, princess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>Varenka answered hurriedly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a good deed you did yesterday to our poor compatriot!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>said the princess.
<p/>Varenka flushed a little.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember.
<p/>I don't think I did anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you saved that Levin from disagreeable consequences.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,  sa compagne  called me, and I tried to pacify him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s very ill, and was dissatisfied with the doctor.
<p/>I'm used to looking after such invalids.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I've heard you live at Mentone with your aunt--I think-- Madame Stahl: I used to know her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)  belle-soeur .''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)'s not my aunt.
<p/>I call her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) mamma, but I am not related to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>); I was brought up by her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>answered Varenka, flushing a little again.
<p/>This was so simply said, and so sweet was the truthful and candid expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) face, that the princess saw why Kitty had taken such a fancy to Varenka.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and what's this Levin going to do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>asked the princess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s going away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>answered Varenka.
<p/>At that instant Kitty came up from the spring beaming with delight that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother had become acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) unknown friend.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, see, Kitty, your intense desire to make friends with Mademoiselle.
<p/>.
<p/>.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Varenka,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>Varenka put in smiling, <div class="bookquote">``that's what everyone calls me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty blushed with pleasure, and slowly, without speaking, pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) new friend's hand, which did not respond to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) pressure, but lay motionless in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hand.
<p/>The hand did not respond to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) pressure, but the face of Mademoiselle Varenka glowed with a soft, glad, though rather mournful smile, that showed large but handsome teeth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have long wished for this too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are so busy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, I'm not at all busy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>answered Varenka, but at that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) new friends because two little Russian girls, children of an invalid, ran up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Varenka, mamma's calling!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>they cried.
<p/>And Varenka went after them.
<p/>Chapter 32   The particulars which the princess had learned in regard to Varenka's past and her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) relations with Madame Stahl were as follows:  Madame Stahl, of whom some people said that she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had worried her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) husband out of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) life, while others said it was he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) who had made her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) wretched by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) immoral behavior, had always been a woman of weak health and enthusiastic temperament.
<p/>When, after her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) separation from her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) gave birth to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) only child, the child had died almost immediately, and the family of Madame Stahl, knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) sensibility, and fearing the news would kill her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), had substituted another child, a baby born the same night and in the same house in Petersburg, the daughter of the chief cook of the Imperial Household.
<p/>This was Varenka.
<p/>Madame Stahl learned later on that Varenka was not her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own child, but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) went on bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) up, especially as very soon afterwards Varenka had not a relation of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own living.
<p/>Madame Stahl had now been living more than ten years continuously abroad, in the south, never leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) couch.
<p/>And some people said that Madame Stahl had made her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) social position as a philanthropic, highly religious woman; other people said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) really was at heart the highly ethical being, living for nothing but the good of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) fellow creatures, which she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) represented herself to be.
<p/>No one knew what her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) faith was--Catholic, Protestant, or Orthodox.
<p/>But one fact was indubitable--she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was in amicable relations with the highest dignitaries of all the churches and sects.
<p/>Varenka lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) all the while abroad, and everyone who knew Madame Stahl knew and liked Mademoiselle Varenka, as everyone called her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).
<p/>Having learned all these facts, the princess found nothing to object to in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) daughter's intimacy with Varenka, more especially as Varenka's breeding and education were of the best--she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) spoke French and English extremely well--and what was of the most weight, brought a message from Madame Stahl expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) regret that she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was prevented by her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) ill health from making the acquaintance of the princess.
<p/>After getting to know Varenka, Kitty became more and more fascinated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) friend, and every day she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) discovered new virtues in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>The princess, hearing that Varenka had a good voice, asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to come and sing to them in the evening.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kitty plays, and we have a piano; not a good one, it's true, but you will give us so much pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) affected smile, which Kitty disliked particularly just then, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) noticed that Varenka had no inclination to sing.
<p/>Varenka came, however, in the evening and brought a roll of music with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>The princess had invited Marya Yevgenyevna and her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) daughter and the colonel.
<p/>Varenka seemed quite unaffected by there being persons present she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) did not know, and she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) went directly to the piano.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) could not accompany herself, but she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) could sing music at sight very well.
<p/>Kitty, who played well, accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have an extraordinary talent,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>the princess said to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) after Varenka had sung the first song extremely well.
<p/>Marya Yevgenyevna and her (<font color='blue'><b>Yevgenyevna</b></font>) daughter expressed their thanks and admiration.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look,''  (<font color='red'><b>the colonel</b></font>)</div>said the colonel, looking out of the window, <div class="bookquote">``what an audience has collected to listen to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>There actually was quite a considerable crowd under the windows.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad it gives you pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>Varenka answered simply.
<p/>Kitty looked with pride at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) friend.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was enchanted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) talent, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) voice, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face, but most of all by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) manner, by the way Varenka obviously thought nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) singing and was quite unmoved by their praises.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) seemed only to be asking: <div class="bookquote">``Am I to sing again, or is that enough?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it had been I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>thought Kitty, <div class="bookquote">``how proud I should have been!
<p/>How delighted I should have been to see that crowd under the windows!
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)'s utterly unmoved by it.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) only motive is to avoid refusing and to please mamma.
<p/>What is there in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)?
<p/>What is it gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) the power to look down on everything, to be calm independently of everything?
<p/>How I should like to know it and to learn it of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Kitty, gazing into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) serene face.
<p/>The princess asked Varenka to sing again, and Varenka sang another song, also smoothly, distinctly, and well, standing erect at the piano and beating time on it with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) thin, dark-skinned hand.
<p/>The next song in the book was an Italian one.
<p/>Kitty played the opening bars, and looked round at Varenka.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's skip that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Varenka, flushing a little.
<p/>Kitty let her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes rest on Varenka's face, with a look of dismay and inquiry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, the next one,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said hurriedly, turning over the pages, and at once feeling that there was something connected with the song.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>answered Varenka with a smile, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hand on the music, <div class="bookquote">``no, let's have that one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sang it just as quietly, as coolly, and as well as the others.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had finished, they all thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) again, and went off to tea.
<p/>Kitty and Varenka went out into the little garden that adjoined the house.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I right, that you have some reminiscences connected with that song?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) added hastily, <div class="bookquote">``only say if I'm right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, why not?
<p/>I'll tell you simply,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Varenka, and, without waiting for a reply, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) went on: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it brings up memories, once painful ones.
<p/>I cared for someone once, and I used to sing him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) that song.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty with big, wide-open eyes gazed silently, sympathetically at Varenka.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cared for him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) cared for me; but his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) mother did not wish it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) married another girl.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s living now not far from us, and I see him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sometimes.
<p/>You didn't think I had a love story too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, and there was a faint gleam in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) handsome face of that fire which Kitty felt must once have glowed all over her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't think so?
<p/>Why, if I were a man, I could never care for anyone else after knowing you.
<p/>Only I can't understand how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could, to please his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, forget you and make you unhappy; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no heart.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a very good man, and I'm not unhappy; quite the contrary, I'm very happy.
<p/>Well, so we shan't be singing any more now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) added, turning towards the house.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How good you are!
<p/>how good you are!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Kitty, and stopping her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I could only be even a little like you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you be like anyone?
<p/>You're nice as you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Varenka, smiling her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) gentle, weary smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not nice at all.
<p/>Come, tell me....  Stop a minute, let's sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sit down again beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, isn't it humiliating to think that a man has disdained your love, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hasn't cared for it?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't disdain it; I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cared for me, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a dutiful son...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but if it hadn't been on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, if it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own doing?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Kitty, feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was giving away her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) secret, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face, burning with the flush of shame, had betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) already.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have done wrong, and I should not have regretted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>answered Varenka, evidently realizing that they were now talking not of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), but of Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the humiliation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, <div class="bookquote">``the humiliation one can never forget, can never forget,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, remembering her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) look at the last ball during the pause in the music.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is the humiliation?
<p/>Why, you did nothing wrong?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Worse than wrong--shameful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Varenka shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) head and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hand on Kitty's hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what is there shameful?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't tell a man, who didn't care for you, that you loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), did you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not; I never said a word, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew it.
<p/>No, no, there are looks, there are ways; I can't forget it, if I live a hundred years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so?
<p/>I don't understand.
<p/>The whole point is whether you love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Varenka, who called everything by its name.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); I can't forgive myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The shame, the humiliation!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>if everyone were as sensitive as you are!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>said Varenka.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There isn't a girl who hasn't been through the same.
<p/>And it's all so unimportant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what is important?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Kitty, looking into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face with inquisitive wonder.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, there's so much that's important,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Varenka, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, so much that's more important,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>answered Varenka, not knowing what to say.
<p/>But at that instant they heard the princess's voice from the window.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kitty, it's cold!
<p/>Either get a shawl, or come indoors.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It really is time to go in!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>said Varenka, getting up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have to go on to Madame Berthe's; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) asked me to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty held her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) by the hand, and with passionate curiosity and entreaty her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``What is it, what is this of such importance that gives you such tranquillity?
<p/>You know, tell me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>But Varenka did not even know what Kitty's eyes were asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) merely thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had to go to see Madame Berthe too that evening, and to make haste home in time for  maman's  tea at twelve o'clock.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) went indoors, collected her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) music, and saying good-bye to everyone, was about to go.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Allow me to see you home,''  (<font color='red'><b>the colonel</b></font>)</div>said the colonel.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, how can you go alone at night like this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>chimed in the princess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyway, I'll send Parasha.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty saw that Varenka could hardly restrain a smile at the idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) needed an escort.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I always go about alone and nothing ever happens to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hat.
<p/>And kissing Kitty once more, without saying what was important, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) stepped out courageously with the music under her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) arm and vanished into the twilight of the summer night, bearing away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) secret of what was important and what gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) the calm and dignity so much to be envied.
<p/>Chapter 33   Kitty made the acquaintance of Madame Stahl too, and this acquaintance, together with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) friendship with Varenka, did not merely exercise a great influence on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), it also comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mental distress.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) found this comfort through a completely new world being opened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) by means of this acquaintance, a world having nothing in common with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) past, an exalted, noble world, from the height of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could contemplate her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) past calmly.
<p/>It was revealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) that besides the instinctive life to which Kitty had given herself up hitherto there was a spiritual life.
<p/>This life was disclosed in religion, but a religion having nothing in common with that one which Kitty had known from childhood, and which found expression in litanies and all-night services at the Widow's Home, where one might meet one's friends, and in learning by heart Slavonic texts with the priest.
<p/>This was a lofty, mysterious religion connected with a whole series of noble thoughts and feelings, which one could do more than merely believe because one was told to, which one could love.
<p/>Kitty found all this out not from words.
<p/>Madame Stahl talked to Kitty as to a charming child that one looks on with pleasure as on the memory of one's youth, and only once she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said in passing that in all human sorrows nothing gives comfort but love and faith, and that in the sight of Christ's compassion for us no sorrow is trifling--and immediately talked of other things.
<p/>But in every gesture of Madame Stahl, in every word, in every heavenly--as Kitty called it--look, and above all in the whole story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) life, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) heard from Varenka, Kitty recognized that something <div class="bookquote">``that was important,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>of which, till then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had known nothing.
<p/>Yet, elevated as Madame Stahl's character was, touching as was her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) story, and exalted and moving as was her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) speech, Kitty could not help detecting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) some traits which perplexed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) noticed that when questioning her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) family, Madame Stahl had smiled contemptuously, which was not in accord with Christian meekness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) noticed, too, that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had found a Catholic priest with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), Madame Stahl had studiously kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face in the shadow of the lamp-shade and had smiled in a peculiar way.
<p/>Trivial as these two observations were, they perplexed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) doubts as to Madame Stahl.
<p/>But on the other hand Varenka, alone in the world, without friends or relations, with a melancholy disappointment in the past, desiring nothing, regretting nothing, was just that perfection of which Kitty dared hardly dream.
<p/>In Varenka she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) realized that one has but to forget oneself and love others, and one will be calm, happy, and noble.
<p/>And that was what Kitty longed to be.
<p/>Seeing now clearly what was  the most important , Kitty was not satisfied with being enthusiastic over it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) at once gave herself up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) whole soul to the new life that was opening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>From Varenka's accounts of the doings of Madame Stahl and other people whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mentioned, Kitty had already constructed the plan of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own future life.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) would, like Madame Stahl's niece, Aline, of whom Varenka had talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Aline</b></font>) a great deal, seek out those who were in trouble, wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Aline</b></font>) might be living, help them as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Aline</b></font>) could, give them the Gospel, read the Gospel to the sick, to criminals, to the dying.
<p/>The idea of reading the Gospel to criminals, as Aline did, particularly fascinated Kitty.
<p/>But all these were secret dreams, of which Kitty did not talk either to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother or to Varenka.
<p/>While awaiting the time for carrying out her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) plans on a large scale, however, Kitty, even then at the springs, where there were so many people ill and unhappy, readily found a chance for practicing her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) new principles in imitation of Varenka.
<p/>At first the princess noticed nothing but that Kitty was much under the influence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)  engouement , as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) called it, for Madame Stahl, and still more for Varenka.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) saw that Kitty did not merely imitate Varenka in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) conduct, but unconsciously imitated her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) manner of walking, of talking, of blinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>But later on the princess noticed that, apart from this adoration, some kind of serious spiritual change was taking place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) daughter.
<p/>The princess saw that in the evenings Kitty read a French testament that Madame Stahl had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)--a thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had never done before; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) avoided society acquaintances and associated with the sick people who were under Varenka's protection, and especially one poor family, that of a sick painter, Petrov.
<p/>Kitty was unmistakably proud of playing the part of a sister of mercy in that family.
<p/>All this was well enough, and the princess had nothing to say against it, especially as Petrov's wife was a perfectly nice sort of woman, and that the German princess, noticing Kitty's devotion, praised her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) an angel of consolation.
<p/>All this would have been very well, if there had been no exaggeration.
<p/>But the princess saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) daughter was rushing into extremes, and so indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).  ''
<p/>Il ne faut jamais rien outrer ,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) daughter made her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) no reply, only in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) thought that one could not talk about exaggeration where Christianity was concerned.
<p/>What exaggeration could there be in the practice of a doctrine wherein one was bidden to turn the other cheek when one was smitten, and give one's cloak if one's coat were taken?
<p/>But the princess disliked this exaggeration, and disliked even more the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) daughter did not care to show her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Kitty did in fact conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) new views and feelings from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) concealed them not because she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not respect or did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother, but simply because she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) would have revealed them to anyone sooner than to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is it Anna Pavlovna's not been to see us for so long?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>the princess said one day of Madame Petrova.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've asked her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) seems put out about something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I've not noticed it, maman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, flushing hotly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it long since you went to see them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We're meaning to make an expedition to the mountains tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>answered Kitty,  <div class="bookquote">``Well, you can go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>answered the princess, gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) daughter's embarrassed face and trying to guess the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) embarrassment.
<p/>That day Varenka came to dinner and told them that Anna Pavlovna had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) mind and given up the expedition for the morrow.
<p/>And the princess noticed again that Kitty reddened.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kitty, haven't you had some misunderstanding with the Petrovs?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>said the princess, when they were left alone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why has she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) given up sending the children and coming to see us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty answered that nothing had happened between them, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not tell why Anna Pavlovna seemed displeased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>).
<p/>Kitty answered perfectly truly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not know the reason Anna Pavlovna had changed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) guessed it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) guessed at something which she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) could not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) mother, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) did not put into words to herself.
<p/>It was one of those things which one knows but which one can never speak of even to oneself, so terrible and shameful would it be to be mistaken.
<p/>Again and again she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) went over in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) memory all her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) relations with the family.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) remembered the simple delight expressed on the round, good-humored face of Anna Pavlovna at their meetings; she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) remembered their secret confabulations about the invalid, their plots to draw him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) away from the work which was forbidden him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>), and to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) out-of-doors; the devotion of the youngest boy, who used to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``my Kitty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>and would not go to bed without her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>How nice it all was!
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) recalled the thin, terribly thin figure of Petrov, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrov</b></font>) long neck, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrov</b></font>) brown coat, his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrov</b></font>) scant, curly hair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrov</b></font>) questioning blue eyes that were so terrible to Kitty at first, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrov</b></font>) painful attempts to seem hearty and lively in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) presence.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) recalled the efforts she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had made at first to overcome the repugnance she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt for him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrov</b></font>), as for all consumptive people, and the pains it had cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to think of things to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrov</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) recalled the timid, softened look with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrov</b></font>) gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and the strange feeling of compassion and awkwardness, and later of a sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own goodness, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had felt at it.
<p/>How nice it all was!
<p/>But all that was at first.
<p/>Now, a few days ago, everything was suddenly spoiled.
<p/>Anna Pavlovna had met Kitty with affected cordiality, and had kept continual watch on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) husband.
<p/>Could that touching pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) showed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) came near be the cause of Anna Pavlovna's coolness?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) mused, <div class="bookquote">``there was something unnatural about Anna Pavlovna, and utterly unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) good nature, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) said angrily the day before yesterday: `There, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will keep waiting for you; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wouldn't drink his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) coffee without you, though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s grown so dreadfully weak.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, perhaps, too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) didn't like it when I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the rug.
<p/>It was all so simple, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) took it so awkwardly, and was so long thanking me, that I felt awkward too.
<p/>And then that portrait of me he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did so well.
<p/>And most of all that look of confusion and tenderness!
<p/>Yes, yes, that's it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty repeated to herself with horror.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it can't be, it oughtn't to be!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s so much to be pitied!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said to herself directly after.
<p/>This doubt poisoned the charm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) new life.
<p/>Chapter 34   Before the end of the course of drinking the waters, Prince Shtcherbatsky, who had gone on from Carlsbad to Baden and Kissingen to Russian friends--to get a breath of Russian air, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) said--came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) wife and daughter.
<p/>The views of the prince and of the princess on life abroad were completely opposed.
<p/>The princess thought everything delightful, and in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) established position in Russian society, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) tried abroad to be like a European fashionable lady, which she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was not--for the simple reason that she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was a typical Russian gentlewoman; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was affected, which did not altogether suit her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).
<p/>The prince, on the contrary, thought everything foreign detestable, got sick of European life, kept to his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Russian habits, and purposely tried to show himself abroad less European than he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) was in reality.
<p/>The prince returned thinner, with the skin hanging in loose bags on his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) cheeks, but in the most cheerful frame of mind.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) good humor was even greater when he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) saw Kitty completely recovered.
<p/>The news of Kitty's friendship with Madame Stahl and Varenka, and the reports the princess gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Stahl</b></font>) of some kind of change she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had noticed in Kitty, troubled the prince and aroused his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) habitual feeling of jealousy of everything that drew his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) daughter away from him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>), and a dread that his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) daughter might have got out of the reach of his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) influence into regions inaccessible to him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>).
<p/>But these unpleasant matters were all drowned in the sea of kindliness and good humor which was always within him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>), and more so than ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) course of Carlsbad waters.
<p/>The day after his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) arrival the prince, in his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) long overcoat, with his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Russian wrinkles and baggy cheeks propped up by a starched collar, set off with his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) daughter to the spring in the greatest good humor.
<p/>It was a lovely morning: the bright, cheerful houses with their little gardens, the sight of the red-faced, red-armed, beer-drinking German waitresses, working away merrily, did the heart good.
<p/>But the nearer they got to the springs the oftener they met sick people; and their appearance seemed more pitiable than ever among the everyday conditions of prosperous German life.
<p/>Kitty was no longer struck by this contrast.
<p/>The bright sun, the brilliant green of the foliage, the strains of the music were for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) the natural setting of all these familiar faces, with their changes to greater emaciation or to convalescence, for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) watched.
<p/>But to the prince the brightness and gaiety of the June morning, and the sound of the orchestra playing a gay waltz then in fashion, and above all, the appearance of the healthy attendants, seemed something unseemly and monstrous, in conjunction with these slowly moving, dying figures gathered together from all parts of Europe.
<p/>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) feeling of pride and, as it were, of the return of youth, with his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) favorite daughter on his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) felt awkward, and almost ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) vigorous step and his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) sturdy, stout limbs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) felt almost like a man not dressed in a crowd.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Present me to your new friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) daughter, squeezing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hand with his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) elbow.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like even your horrid Soden for making you so well again.
<p/>Only it's melancholy, very melancholy here.
<p/>Who's that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty mentioned the names of all the people they met, with some of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was acquainted and some not.
<p/>At the entrance of the garden they met the blind lady, Madame Berthe, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) guide, and the prince was delighted to see the old Frenchwoman's face light up when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heard Kitty's voice.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) at once began talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) with French exaggerated politeness, applauding him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) for having such a delightful daughter, extolling Kitty to the skies before her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face, and calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) a treasure, a pearl, and a consoling angel.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)'s the second angel, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div>said the prince, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) calls Mademoiselle Varenka angel number one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>Mademoiselle Varenka, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)'s a real angel, allez,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Berthe</b></font>)</div>Madame Berthe assented.
<p/>In the arcade they met Varenka herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was walking rapidly towards them carrying an elegant red bag.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is papa come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>Kitty said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>Varenka made--simply and naturally as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did everything--a movement between a bow and a curtsey, and immediately began talking to the prince, without shyness, naturally, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) talked to everyone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I know you; I know you very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div>the prince said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) with a smile, in which Kitty detected with joy that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) friend.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you off to in such haste?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maman's here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, turning to Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) has not slept all night, and the doctor advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to go out.
<p/>I'm taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that's angel number one?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>said the prince when Varenka had gone on.
<p/>Kitty saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father had meant to make fun of Varenka, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not do it because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, so we shall see all your friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``even Madame Stahl, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) deigns to recognize me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, did you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), papa?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty asked apprehensively, catching the gleam of irony that kindled in the prince's eyes at the mention of Madame Stahl.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I used to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) too a little, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)'d joined the Pietists.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is a Pietist, papa?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Kitty, dismayed to find that what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) prized so highly in Madame Stahl had a name.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't quite know myself.
<p/>I only know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) thanks God for everything, for every misfortune, and thanks God too that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband died.
<p/>And that's rather droll, as they didn't get on together.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's that?
<p/>What a piteous face!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) asked, noticing a sick man of medium height sitting on a bench, wearing a brown overcoat and white trousers that fell in strange folds about his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) long, fleshless legs.
<p/>This man lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) straw hat, showed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scanty curly hair and high forehead, painfully reddened by the pressure of the hat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's Petrov, an artist,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>answered Kitty, blushing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrov</b></font>) wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) added, indicating Anna Pavlovna, who, as though on purpose, at the very instant they approached walked away after a child that had run off along a path.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor fellow!
<p/>and what a nice face he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>said the prince.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you go up to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wanted to speak to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let us go, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, turning round resolutely.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you feeling today?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) asked Petrov.
<p/>Petrov got up, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrov</b></font>) stick, and looked shyly at the prince.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is my daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div>said the prince.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me introduce myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The painter</b></font>)</div><p/>The painter bowed and smiled, showing his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) strangely dazzling white teeth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We expected you yesterday, princess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) said to Kitty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) staggered as he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) said this, and then repeated the motion, trying to make it seem as if it had been intentional.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant to come, but Varenka said that Anna Pavlovna sent word you were not going.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not going!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Petrov</b></font>)</div><p/>said Petrov, blushing, and immediately beginning to cough, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrov</b></font>) eyes sought his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrov</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anita!
<p/>Anita!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrov</b></font>) said loudly, and the swollen veins stood out like cords on his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrov</b></font>) thin white neck.
<p/>Anna Pavlovna came up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you sent word to the princess that we weren't going!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrov</b></font>) whispered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) angrily, losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrov</b></font>) voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, princess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna Pavlovna</b></font>)</div>said Anna Pavlovna, with an assumed smile utterly unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) former manner.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very glad to make your acquaintance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) said to the prince.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've long been expected, prince.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you send word to the princess that we weren't going for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the artist</b></font>)</div><p/>the artist whispered hoarsely once more, still more angrily, obviously exasperated that his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) voice failed him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) so that he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) could not give his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) words the expression he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) would have liked to.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mercy on us!
<p/>I thought we weren't going,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) wife answered crossly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, when...''   (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) coughed and waved his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) hand.
<p/>The prince took off his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) hat and moved away with his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) daughter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>ah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) sighed deeply.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, poor things!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>answered Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you must know they've three children, no servant, and scarcely any means.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) gets something from the Academy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) went on briskly, trying to drown the distress that the queer change in Anna Pavlovna's manner to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>) had aroused in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, here's Madame Stahl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, indicating an invalid carriage, where, propped on pillows, something in gray and blue was lying under a sunshade.
<p/>This was Madame Stahl.
<p/>Behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) stood the gloomy, healthy-looking German workman who pushed the carriage.
<p/>Close by was standing a flaxen-headed Swedish count, whom Kitty knew by name.
<p/>Several invalids were lingering near the low carriage, staring at the lady as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) were some curiosity.
<p/>The prince went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and Kitty detected that disconcerting gleam of irony in his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) went up to Madame Stahl, and addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) with extreme courtesy and affability in that excellent French that so few speak nowadays.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know if you remember me, but I must recall myself to thank you for your kindness to my daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stahl</b></font>) said, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Stahl</b></font>) hat and not putting it on again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Prince Alexander Shtcherbatsky,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Stahl/Stahl</b></font>)</div>said Madame Stahl, lifting upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Stahl</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) heavenly eyes, in which Kitty discerned a look of annoyance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Delighted!
<p/>I have taken a great fancy to your daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I'm used to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Stahl/Stahl</b></font>)</div>said Madame Stahl, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) introduced the prince to the Swedish count.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are scarcely changed at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div>the prince said to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's ten or eleven years since I had the honor of seeing you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; God sends the cross and sends the strength to bear it.
<p/>Often one wonders what is the goal of this life?...
<p/>The other side!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said angrily to Varenka, who had rearranged the rug over her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) feet not to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) satisfaction.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To do good, probably,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div>said the prince with a twinkle in his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) eye.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not for us to judge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Stahl/Stahl</b></font>)</div>said Madame Stahl, perceiving the shade of expression on the prince's face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you will send me that book, dear count?
<p/>I'm very grateful to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said to the young Swede.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>cried the prince, catching sight of the Moscow colonel standing near, and with a bow to Madame Stahl he (<font color='blue'><b>Stahl</b></font>) walked away with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stahl</b></font>) daughter and the Moscow colonel, who joined them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's our aristocracy, prince!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Moscow colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>the Moscow colonel said with ironical intention.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, papa!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty objected warmly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Varenka worships her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) does so much good!
<p/>Ask anyone!
<p/>Everyone knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) and Aline Stahl.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div>said the prince, squeezing her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hand with his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) elbow; <div class="bookquote">``but it's better when one does good so that you may ask everyone and no one knows.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty did not answer, not because she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had nothing to say, but because she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not care to reveal her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) secret thoughts even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father.
<p/>But, strange to say, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had so made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mind not to be influenced by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father's views, not to let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) inmost sanctuary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt that the heavenly image of Madame Stahl, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had carried for a whole month in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) heart, had vanished, never to return, just as the fantastic figure made up of some clothes thrown down at random vanishes when one sees that it is only some garment lying there.
<p/>All that was left was a woman with short legs, who lay down because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a bad figure, and worried patient Varenka for not arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rug to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) liking.
<p/>And by no effort of the imagination could Kitty bring back the former Madame Stahl.
<p/>Chapter 35   The prince communicated his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) good humor to his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) own family and his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) friends, and even to the German landlord in whose rooms the Shtcherbatskys were staying.
<p/>On coming back with Kitty from the springs, the prince, who had asked the colonel, and Marya Yevgenyevna, and Varenka all to come and have coffee with them, gave orders for a table and chairs to be taken into the garden under the chestnut tree, and lunch to be laid there.
<p/>The landlord and the servants, too, grew brisker under the influence of his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) good spirits.
<p/>They knew his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) open-handedness; and half an hour later the invalid doctor from Hamburg, who lived on the top floor, looked enviously out of the window at the merry party of healthy Russians assembled under the chestnut tree.
<p/>In the trembling circles of shadow cast by the leaves, at a table, covered with a white cloth, and set with coffeepot, bread-and-butter, cheese, and cold game, sat the princess in a high cap with lilac ribbons, distributing cups and bread-and-butter.
<p/>At the other end sat the prince, eating heartily, and talking loudly and merrily.
<p/>The prince had spread out near him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) purchases, carved boxes, and knick-knacks, paper-knives of all sorts, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) bought a heap at every watering-place, and bestowed them upon everyone, including Lieschen, the servant girl, and the landlord, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) jested in his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) comically bad German, assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) that it was not the water had cured Kitty, but his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) splendid cookery, especially his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) plum soup.
<p/>The princess laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) husband for his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) Russian ways, but she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was more lively and good-humored than she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had been all the while she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had been at the waters.
<p/>The colonel smiled, as he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) always did, at the prince's jokes, but as far as regards Europe, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) believed himself to be making a careful study, he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) took the princess's side.
<p/>The simple-hearted Marya Yevgenyevna simply roared with laughter at everything absurd the prince said, and his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) jokes made Varenka helpless with feeble but infectious laughter, which was something Kitty had never seen before.
<p/>Kitty was glad of all this, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not be light-hearted.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not solve the problem her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father had unconsciously set her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) goodhumored view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) friends, and of the life that had so attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>To this doubt there was joined the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) relations with the Petrovs, which had been so conspicuously and unpleasantly marked that morning.
<p/>Everyone was good humored, but Kitty could not feel good humored, and this increased her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) distress.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt a feeling such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had known in childhood, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had been shut in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) room as a punishment, and had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sisters' merry laughter outside.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but what did you buy this mass of things for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>said the princess, smiling, and handing her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) husband a cup of coffee.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One goes for a walk, one looks in a shop, and they ask you to buy. '
<p/>Erlaucht, Durchlaucht? '
<p/>Directly they say ' Durchlaucht ,' I can't hold out.
<p/>I lose ten thalers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's simply from boredom,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it is.
<p/>Such boredom, my dear, that one doesn't know what to do with oneself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you be bored, prince?
<p/>There's so much that's interesting now in Germany,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marya Yevgenyevna</b></font>)</div>said Marya Yevgenyevna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I know everything that's interesting: the plum soup I know, and the pea sausages I know.
<p/>I know everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you may say what you like, prince, there's the interest of their institutions,''  (<font color='red'><b>the colonel</b></font>)</div>said the colonel.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is there interesting about it?
<p/>They're all as pleased as brass halfpence.
<p/>They've conquered everybody, and why am I to be pleased at that?
<p/>I haven't conquered anyone; and I'm obliged to take off my own boots, yes, and put them away too; in the morning, get up and dress at once, and go to the dining room to drink bad tea!
<p/>How different it is at home!
<p/>You get up in no haste, you get cross, grumble a little, and come round again.
<p/>You've time to think things over, and no hurry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But time's money, you forget that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the colonel</b></font>)</div>said the colonel.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Time, indeed, that depends!
<p/>Why, there's time one would give a month of for sixpence, and time you wouldn't give half an hour of for any money.
<p/>Isn't that so, Katinka?
<p/>What is it?
<p/>why are you so depressed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not depressed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you off to?
<p/>Stay a little longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) said to Varenka.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must be going home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Varenka, getting up, and again she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) went off into a giggle.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had recovered, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said good-bye, and went into the house to get her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hat.
<p/>Kitty followed her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
<p/>Even Varenka struck her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) as different.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was not worse, but different from what she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had fancied her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) before.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear!

 (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Varenka.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>answered Varenka.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're getting ready to go away, so I promised to help them pack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Kitty, opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes wide, and clutching at Varenka's parasol, so as not to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) go.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, wait a minute; why not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing; your father has come, and besides, they will feel awkward at your helping.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Varenka.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything, everything!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty assented.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's really nothing of any consequence; only that Mihail Alexeyevitch''  (<font color='red'><b>the artist</b></font>)</div>-LRB-that was the artist's name-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``had meant to leave earlier, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) doesn't want to go away,''  (<font color='red'><b>the artist</b></font>)</div>said Varenka, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty urged impatiently, looking darkly at Varenka.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and for some reason Anna Pavlovna told him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) didn't want to go because you are here.
<p/>Of course, that was nonsense; but there was a dispute over it--over you.
<p/>You know how irritable these sick people are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty, scowling more than ever, kept silent, and Varenka went on speaking alone, trying to soften or soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and seeing a storm coming--she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not know whether of tears or of words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you'd better not go....  You understand; you won't be offended?...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty cried quickly, snatching the parasol out of Varenka's hand, and looking past her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) friend's face.
<p/>Varenka felt inclined to smile, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) childish fury, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was afraid of wounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How does it serve you right?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A sham!

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To seem better to people, to myself, to God; to deceive everyone.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is not that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Varenka in bewilderment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything.

<p/>I liked you simply, but you most likely only wanted to save me, to improve me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are unjust,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Varenka.

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty, with a haughty air, without making peace with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) friend, took the necklace in a little box from the table and went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?
<p/>Why are you so red?''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother father</b></font>)</div><p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother and father said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) with one voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be back directly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) ran back.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)'s still here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)?

<p/>Why was I rude to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)?
<p/>What am I to do?
<p/>What am I to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Kitty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) stopped in the doorway.
<p/>Varenka in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hat and with the parasol in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hands was sitting at the table examining the spring which Kitty had broken.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Varenka, forgive me, do forgive me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>whispered Kitty, going up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember what I said.
<p/>I...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I really didn't mean to hurt you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Varenka, smiling.
<p/>Peace was made.
<p/>But with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father's coming all the world in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had been living was transformed for Kitty.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not give up everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had learned, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) became aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had deceived herself in supposing she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could be what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wanted to be.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes were, it seemed, opened; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt all the difficulty of maintaining herself without hypocrisy and self-conceit on the pinnacle to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had wished to mount.
<p/>Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) became aware of all the dreariness of the world of sorrow, of sick and dying people, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had been living.
<p/>The efforts she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had made to like it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) intolerable, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt a longing to get back quickly into the fresh air, to Russia, to Ergushovo, where, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knew from letters, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sister Dolly had already gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) children.
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) affection for Varenka did not wane.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said good-bye, Kitty begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to come to them in Russia.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll come when you get married,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Varenka.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never marry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I shall never come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I shall be married simply for that.
<p/>Mind now, remember your promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty.
<p/>The doctor's prediction was fulfilled.
<p/>Kitty returned home to Russia cured.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was not so gay and thoughtless as before, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was serene.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) Moscow troubles had become a memory to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>PART THREE    Chapter 1   Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev wanted a rest from mental work, and instead of going abroad as he (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) usually did, he (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) came towards the end of May to stay in the country with his (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) brother.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) judgment the best sort of life was a country life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) had come now to enjoy such a life at his (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) brother's.
<p/>Konstantin Levin was very glad to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), especially as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not expect his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother Nikolay that summer.
<p/>But in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) affection and respect for Sergey Ivanovitch, Konstantin Levin was uncomfortable with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother in the country.
<p/>It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) uncomfortable, and it positively annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's attitude to the country.
<p/>To Konstantin Levin the country was the background of life, that is of pleasures, endeavors, labor.
<p/>To Sergey Ivanovitch the country meant on one hand rest from work, on the other a valuable antidote to the corrupt influences of town, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) took with satisfaction and a sense of its utility.
<p/>To Konstantin Levin the country was good first because it afforded a field for labor, of the usefulness of which there could be no doubt.
<p/>To Sergey Ivanovitch the country was particularly good, because there it was possible and fitting to do nothing.
<p/>Moreover, Sergey Ivanovitch's attitude to the peasants rather piqued Konstantin.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch used to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) knew and liked the peasantry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) often talked to the peasants, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) knew how to do without affectation or condescension, and from every such conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) would deduce general conclusions in favor of the peasantry and in confirmation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) knowing them.
<p/>Konstantin Levin did not like such an attitude to the peasants.
<p/>To Konstantin the peasant was simply the chief partner in their common labor, and in spite of all the respect and the love, almost like that of kinship, he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) had for the peasant-- sucked in probably, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) said himself, with the milk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) peasant nurse--still as a fellow-worker with him (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>), while sometimes enthusiastic over the vigor, gentleness, and justice of these men, he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) was very often, when their common labors called for other qualities, exasperated with the peasant for his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) carelessness, lack of method, drunkenness, and lying.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had been asked whether he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) liked or didn't like the peasants, Konstantin Levin would have been absolutely at a loss what to reply.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) liked and did not like the peasants, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) liked and did not like men in general.
<p/>Of course, being a good-hearted man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked men rather than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disliked them, and so too with the peasants.
<p/>But like or dislike <div class="bookquote">``the people''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as something apart he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not, not only because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lived with <div class="bookquote">``the people,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) interests were bound up with theirs, but also because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regarded himself as a part of <div class="bookquote">``the people,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>did not see any special qualities or failings distinguishing himself and <div class="bookquote">``the people,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and could not contrast himself with them.
<p/>Moreover, although he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lived so long in the closest relations with the peasants, as farmer and arbitrator, and what was more, as adviser -LRB-the peasants trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>), and for thirty miles round they would come to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) advice-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) had no definite views of <div class="bookquote">``the people,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and would have been as much at a loss to answer the question whether he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) knew <div class="bookquote">``the people''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as the question whether he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) liked them.
<p/>For him (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) to say he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) knew the peasantry would have been the same as to say he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) knew men.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) was continually watching and getting to know people of all sorts, and among them peasants, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) regarded as good and interesting people, and he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) was continually observing new points in them, altering his (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) former views of them and forming new ones.
<p/>With Sergey Ivanovitch it was quite the contrary.
<p/>Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) liked and praised a country life in comparison with the life he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) did not like, so too he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) liked the peasantry in contradistinction to the class of men he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) did not like, and so too he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) knew the peasantry as something distinct from and opposed to men generally.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) methodical brain there were distinctly formulated certain aspects of peasant life, deduced partly from that life itself, but chiefly from contrast with other modes of life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) never changed his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) opinion of the peasantry and his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) sympathetic attitude towards them.
<p/>In the discussions that arose between the brothers on their views of the peasantry, Sergey Ivanovitch always got the better of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother, precisely because Sergey Ivanovitch had definite ideas about the peasant--his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) character, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) qualities, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) tastes.
<p/>Konstantin Levin had no definite and unalterable idea on the subject, and so in their arguments Konstantin was readily convicted of contradicting himself.
<p/>In Sergey Ivanovitch's eyes his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) younger brother was a capital fellow,  with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) heart in the right place  -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) expressed it in French-RRB-, but with a mind which, though fairly quick, was too much influenced by the impressions of the moment, and consequently filled with contradictions.
<p/>With all the condescension of an elder brother he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sometimes explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) the true import of things, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) derived little satisfaction from arguing with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) got the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) too easily.
<p/>Konstantin Levin regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother as a man of immense intellect and culture, as generous in the highest sense of the word, and possessed of a special faculty for working for the public good.
<p/>But in the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart, the older he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) became, and the more intimately he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, the more and more frequently the thought struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that this faculty of working for the public good, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt himself utterly devoid, was possibly not so much a quality as a lack of something --not a lack of good, honest, noble desires and tastes, but a lack of vital force, of what is called heart, of that impulse which drives a man to choose someone out of the innumerable paths of life, and to care only for that one.
<p/>The better he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) noticed that Sergey Ivanovitch, and many other people who worked for the public welfare, were not led by an impulse of the heart to care for the public good, but reasoned from intellectual considerations that it was a right thing to take interest in public affairs, and consequently took interest in them.
<p/>Levin was confirmed in this generalization by observing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother did not take questions affecting the public welfare or the question of the immortality of the soul a bit more to heart than he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did chess problems, or the ingenious construction of a new machine.
<p/>Besides this, Konstantin Levin was not at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ease with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, because in summer in the country Levin was continually busy with work on the land, and the long summer day was not long enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to get through all he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to do, while Sergey Ivanovitch was taking a holiday.
<p/>But though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was taking a holiday now, that is to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was doing no writing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was so used to intellectual activity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) liked to put into concise and eloquent shape the ideas that occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), and liked to have someone to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) most usual and natural listener was his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother.
<p/>And so in spite of the friendliness and directness of their relations, Konstantin felt an awkwardness in leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) alone.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch liked to stretch himself on the grass in the sun, and to lie so, basking and chatting lazily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) would say to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother, <div class="bookquote">``what a pleasure this rural laziness is to me.
<p/>Not an idea in one's brain, as empty as a drum!''
 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>But Konstantin Levin found it dull sitting and listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew that while he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was away they would be carting dung onto the fields not ploughed ready for it, and heaping it all up anyhow; and would not screw the shares in the ploughs, but would let them come off and then say that the new ploughs were a silly invention, and there was nothing like the old Andreevna plough, and so on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, you've done enough trudging about in the heat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>Sergey Ivanovitch would say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I must just run round to the counting-house for a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin would answer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would run off to the fields.
<p/>Chapter 2   Early in June it happened that Agafea Mihalovna, the old nurse and housekeeper, in carrying to the cellar a jar of mushrooms she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) had just pickled, slipped, fell, and sprained her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) wrist.
<p/>The district doctor, a talkative young medical student, who had just finished his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) studies, came to see her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) examined the wrist, said it was not broken, was delighted at a chance of talking to the celebrated Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev, and to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) advanced views of things told him (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) all the scandal of the district, complaining of the poor state into which the district council had fallen.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch listened attentively, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) questions, and, roused by a new listener, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) talked fluently, uttered a few keen and weighty observations, respectfully appreciated by the young doctor, and was soon in that eager frame of mind his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) brother knew so well, which always, with him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), followed a brilliant and eager conversation.
<p/>After the departure of the doctor, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wanted to go with a fishing rod to the river.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch was fond of angling, and was, it seemed, proud of being able to care for such a stupid occupation.
<p/>Konstantin Levin, whose presence was needed in the plough land and meadows, had come to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother in the trap.
<p/>It was that time of the year, the turning-point of summer, when the crops of the present year are a certainty, when one begins to think of the sowing for next year, and the mowing is at hand; when the rye is all in ear, though its ears are still light, not yet full, and it waves in gray-green billows in the wind; when the green oats, with tufts of yellow grass scattered here and there among it, droop irregularly over the late-sown fields; when the early buckwheat is already out and hiding the ground; when the fallow lands, trodden hard as stone by the cattle, are half ploughed over, with paths left untouched by the plough; when from the dry dung-heaps carted onto the fields there comes at sunset a smell of manure mixed with meadow-sweet, and on the low-lying lands the riverside meadows are a thick sea of grass waiting for the mowing, with blackened heaps of the stalks of sorrel among it.
<p/>It was the time when there comes a brief pause in the toil of the fields before the beginning of the labors of harvest--every year recurring, every year straining every nerve of the peasants.
<p/>The crop was a splendid one, and bright, hot summer days had set in with short, dewy nights.
<p/>The brothers had to drive through the woods to reach the meadows.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch was all the while admiring the beauty of the woods, which were a tangled mass of leaves, pointing out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother now an old lime tree on the point of flowering, dark on the shady side, and brightly spotted with yellow stipules, now the young shoots of this year's saplings brilliant with emerald.
<p/>Konstantin Levin did not like talking and hearing about the beauty of nature.
<p/>Words for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took away the beauty of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) assented to what his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not help beginning to think of other things.
<p/>When they came out of the woods, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) attention was engrossed by the view of the fallow land on the upland, in parts yellow with grass, in parts trampled and checkered with furrows, in parts dotted with ridges of dung, and in parts even ploughed.
<p/>A string of carts was moving across it.
<p/>Levin counted the carts, and was pleased that all that were wanted had been brought, and at the sight of the meadows his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thoughts passed to the mowing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) always felt something special moving him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to the quick at the hay-making.
<p/>On reaching the meadow Levin stopped the horse.
<p/>The morning dew was still lying on the thick undergrowth of the grass, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) might not get his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) feet wet, Sergey Ivanovitch asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother to drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) in the trap up to the willow tree from which the carp was caught.
<p/>Sorry as Konstantin Levin was to crush down his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mowing grass, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) into the meadow.
<p/>The high grass softly turned about the wheels and the horse's legs, leaving its seeds clinging to the wet axles and spokes of the wheels.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother seated himself under a bush, arranging his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tackle, while Levin led the horse away, fastened him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) up, and walked into the vast gray-green sea of grass unstirred by the wind.
<p/>The silky grass with its ripe seeds came almost to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) waist in the dampest spots.
<p/>Crossing the meadow, Konstantin Levin came out onto the road, and met an old man with a swollen eye, carrying a skep on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?
<p/>taken a stray swarm, Fomitch?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, Konstantin Dmitrich!
<p/>All we can do to keep our own!
<p/>This is the second swarm that has flown away....  Luckily the lads caught them.
<p/>They were ploughing your field.
<p/>They unyoked the horses and galloped after them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what do you say, Fomitch--start mowing or wait a bit?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, well.
<p/>Our way's to wait till St. Peter's Day.
<p/>But you always mow sooner.
<p/>Well, to be sure, please God, the hay's good.
<p/>There'll be plenty for the beasts.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think about the weather?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's in God's hands.
<p/>Maybe it will be fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch had caught nothing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was not bored, and seemed in the most cheerful frame of mind.
<p/>Levin saw that, stimulated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) conversation with the doctor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wanted to talk.
<p/>Levin, on the other hand, would have liked to get home as soon as possible to give orders about getting together the mowers for next day, and to set at rest his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) doubts about the mowing, which greatly absorbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let's be going,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why be in such a hurry?
<p/>Let's stay a little.
<p/>But how wet you are!
<p/>Even though one catches nothing, it's nice.
<p/>That's the best thing about every part of sport, that one has to do with nature.
<p/>How exquisite this steely water is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>said Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``These riverside banks always remind me of the riddle--do you know it?
<p/>`The grass says to the water: we quiver and we quiver.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know the riddle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin wearily.
<p/>Chapter 3   <div class="bookquote">``Do you know, I've been thinking about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's beyond everything what's being done in the district, according to what this doctor tells me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s a very intelligent fellow.
<p/>And as I've told you before, I tell you again:  it's not right for you not to go to the meetings, and altogether to keep out of the district business.
<p/>If decent people won't go into it, of course it's bound to go all wrong.
<p/>We pay the money, and it all goes in salaries, and there are no schools, nor district nurses, nor midwives, nor drugstores-- nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I did try, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin said slowly and unwillingly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't!
<p/>and so there's no help for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why can't you?
<p/>I must own I can't make it out.
<p/>Indifference, incapacity--I won't admit; surely it's not simply laziness?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None of those things.
<p/>I've tried, and I see I can do nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had hardly grasped what his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother was saying.
<p/>Looking towards the plough land across the river, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) made out something black, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not distinguish whether it was a horse or the bailiff on horseback.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is it you can do nothing?
<p/>You made an attempt and didn't succeed, as you think, and you give in.
<p/>How can you have so little self-respect?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Self-respect!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, stung to the quick by his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's words; <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand.
<p/>If they'd told me at college that other people understood the integral calculus, and I didn't, then pride would have come in.
<p/>But in this case one wants first to be convinced that one has certain qualifications for this sort of business, and especially that all this business is of great importance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!
<p/>do you mean to say it's not of importance?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>said Sergey Ivanovitch, stung to the quick too at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother's considering anything of no importance that interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), and still more at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) obviously paying little attention to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was saying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it important; it does not take hold of me, I can't help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin, making out that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw was the bailiff, and that the bailiff seemed to be letting the peasants go off the ploughed land.
<p/>They were turning the plough over.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can they have finished ploughing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) wondered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, really though,''  (<font color='red'><b>the brother</b></font>)</div>said the elder brother, with a frown on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) handsome, clever face, <div class="bookquote">``there's a limit to everything.
<p/>It's very well to be original and genuine, and to dislike everything conventional--I know all about that; but really, what you're saying either has no meaning, or it has a very wrong meaning.
<p/>How can you think it a matter of no importance whether the peasant, whom you love as you assert...''   (<font color='red'><b>the brother</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I never did assert it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div>thought Konstantin Levin.
<p/>''...dies without help?
<p/>The ignorant peasant-women starve the children, and the people stagnate in darkness, and are helpless in the hands of every village clerk, while you have at your disposal a means of helping them, and don't help them because to your mind it's of no importance.''
<p/>And Sergey Ivanovitch put before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) the alternative: either you are so undeveloped that you can't see all that you can do, or you won't sacrifice your ease, your vanity, or whatever it is, to do it.
<p/>Konstantin Levin felt that there was no course open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) but to submit, or to confess to a lack of zeal for the public good.
<p/>And this mortified him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) feelings.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's both,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said resolutely: <div class="bookquote">``I don't see that it was possible...''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What!
<p/>was it impossible, if the money were properly laid out, to provide medical aid?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible, as it seems to me....  For the three thousand square miles of our district, what with our thaws, and the storms, and the work in the fields, I don't see how it is possible to provide medical aid all over.
<p/>And besides, I don't believe in medicine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, that's unfair...I can quote to you thousands of instances....
<p/>But the schools, anyway.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why have schools?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?
<p/>Can there be two opinions of the advantage of education?
<p/>If it's a good thing for you, it's a good thing for everyone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Konstantin Levin felt himself morally pinned against a wall, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) got hot, and unconsciously blurted out the chief cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) indifference to public business.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it may all be very good; but why should I worry myself about establishing dispensaries which I shall never make use of, and schools to which I shall never send my children, to which even the peasants don't want to send their children, and to which I've no very firm faith that they ought to send them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch was for a minute surprised at this unexpected view of the subject; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) promptly made a new plan of attack.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was silent for a little, drew out a hook, threw it in again, and turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, now....
<p/>In the first place, the dispensary is needed.
<p/>We ourselves sent for the district doctor for Agafea Mihalovna.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, but I fancy her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wrist will never be straight again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That remains to be proved....  Next, the peasant who can read and write is as a workman of more use and value to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you can ask anyone you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div>Konstantin Levin answered with decision, <div class="bookquote">``the man that can read and write is much inferior as a workman.
<p/>And mending the highroads is an impossibility; and as soon as they put up bridges they're stolen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, that's not the point,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) disliked contradiction, and still more, arguments that were continually skipping from one thing to another, introducing new and disconnected points, so that there was no knowing to which to reply.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you admit that education is a benefit for the people?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I admit it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin without thinking, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was conscious immediately that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had said what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not think.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) admitted that, it would be proved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been talking meaningless rubbish.
<p/>How it would be proved he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not tell, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew that this would inevitably be logically proved to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) awaited the proofs.
<p/>The argument turned out to be far simpler than he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had expected.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you admit that it is a benefit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, <div class="bookquote">``then, as an honest man, you cannot help caring about it and sympathizing with the movement, and so wishing to work for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I still do not admit this movement to be just,''  (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div>said Konstantin Levin, reddening a little.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; since we are talking, explain it to me from the philosophical point of view,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't see where philosophy comes in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, in a tone, Levin fancied, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not admit his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's right to talk about philosophy.
<p/>And that irritated Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said with heat, <div class="bookquote">``I imagine the mainspring of all our actions is, after all, self-interest.

<p/>An arbitrator of disputes is no use to me.
<p/>I never appeal to him (<font color='blue'><b>arbitrator</b></font>), and never shall appeal to him (<font color='blue'><b>arbitrator</b></font>).
<p/>The schools are no good to me, but positively harmful, as I told you.
<p/>For me the district institutions simply mean the liability to pay fourpence halfpenny for every three acres, to drive into the town, sleep with bugs, and listen to all sorts of idiocy and loathsomeness, and self-interest offers me no inducement.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>Sergey Ivanovitch interposed with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``self-interest did not induce us to work for the emancipation of the serfs, but we did work for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Konstantin Levin broke in with still greater heat; <div class="bookquote">``the emancipation of the serfs was a different matter.

<p/>`Eh?'''
 (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Konstantin Levin had warmed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) subject, and began mimicking the president and the half-witted Alioshka: it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that it was all to the point.
<p/>But Sergey Ivanovitch shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) shoulders.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I simply mean to say that those rights that touch me...my interest, I shall always defend to the best of my ability; that when they made raids on us students, and the police read our letters, I was ready to defend those rights to the utmost, to defend my rights to education and freedom.
<p/>I can understand compulsory military service, which affects my children, my brothers, and myself, I am ready to deliberate on what concerns me; but deliberating on how to spend forty thousand roubles of district council money, or judging the half-witted Alioshka--I don't understand, and I can't do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Konstantin Levin spoke as though the floodgates of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) speech had burst open.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch smiled.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to be tried.
<p/>I shan't murder anybody, and I've no need of it.
<p/>Well, I tell you what,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) went on, flying off again to a subject quite beside the point, <div class="bookquote">``our district self-government and all the rest of it--it's just like the birch branches we stick in the ground on Trinity Day, for instance, to look like a copse which has grown up of itself in Europe, and I can't gush over these birch branches and believe in them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sergey Ivanovitch merely shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) shoulders, as though to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) wonder how the birch branches had come into their argument at that point, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) did really understand at once what his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother meant.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, but you know one really can't argue in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) observed.
<p/>But Konstantin Levin wanted to justify himself for the failing, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was conscious, of lack of zeal for the public welfare, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I imagine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that no sort of activity is likely to be lasting if it is not founded on self-interest, that's a universal principle, a philosophical principle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, repeating the word <div class="bookquote">``philosophical''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with determination, as though wishing to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had as much right as any one else to talk of philosophy.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch smiled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) too has a philosophy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) own at the service of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) natural tendencies,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, you'd better let philosophy alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The chief problem of the philosophy of all ages consists just in finding the indispensable connection which exists between individual and social interests.

<p/>It's only those peoples that have an intuitive sense of what's of importance and significance in their institutions, and know how to value them, that have a future before them--it's only those peoples that one can truly call historical.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>And Sergey Ivanovitch carried the subject into the regions of philosophical history where Konstantin Levin could not follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) all the incorrectness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) view.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``As for your dislike of it, excuse my saying so, that's simply our Russian sloth and old serf-owner's ways, and I'm convinced that in you it's a temporary error and will pass.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Konstantin was silent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) felt himself vanquished on all sides, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) felt at the same time that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) wanted to say was unintelligible to his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) brother.
<p/>Only he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) could not make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) mind whether it was unintelligible because he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) was not capable of expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) meaning clearly, or because his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) brother would not or could not understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>).
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) did not pursue the speculation, and without replying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) fell to musing on a quite different and personal matter.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch wound up the last line, untied the horse, and they drove off.
<p/>Chapter 4   The personal matter that absorbed Levin during his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) conversation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother was this.
<p/>Once in a previous year he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had gone to look at the mowing, and being made very angry by the bailiff he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) had recourse to his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) favorite means for regaining his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) temper,-- he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) took a scythe from a peasant and began mowing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) liked the work so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) had several times tried his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) hand at mowing since.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) had cut the whole of the meadow in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) house, and this year ever since the early spring he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) had cherished a plan for mowing for whole days together with the peasants.
<p/>Ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) brother's arrival, he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) had been in doubt whether to mow or not.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) was loath to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) brother alone all day long, and he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) was afraid his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) brother would laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) about it.
<p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) drove into the meadow, and recalled the sensations of mowing, he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) came near deciding that he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) would go mowing.
<p/>After the irritating discussion with his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) pondered over this intention again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must have physical exercise, or my temper'll certainly be ruined,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) thought, and he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) determined he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) would go mowing, however awkward he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) might feel about it with his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) brother or the peasants.
<p/>Towards evening Konstantin Levin went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) counting house, gave directions as to the work to be done, and sent about the village to summon the mowers for the morrow, to cut the hay in Kalinov meadow, the largest and best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) grass lands.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And send my scythe, please, to Tit, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to set it, and bring it round tomorrow.
<p/>I shall maybe do some mowing myself too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, trying not to be embarrassed.
<p/>The bailiff smiled and said: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The bailiff</b></font>)</div><p/>At tea the same evening Levin said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother:  <div class="bookquote">``I fancy the fine weather will last.
<p/>Tomorrow I shall start mowing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so fond of that form of field labor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm awfully fond of it.
<p/>I sometimes mow myself with the peasants, and tomorrow I want to try mowing the whole day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>Sergey Ivanovitch lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) head, and looked with interest at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean?
<p/>Just like one of the peasants, all day long?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's very pleasant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's splendid as exercise, only you'll hardly be able to stand it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, without a shade of irony.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've tried it.
<p/>It's hard work at first, but you get into it.
<p/>I dare say I shall manage to keep it up...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really!
<p/>what an idea!
<p/>But tell me, how do the peasants look at it?
<p/>I suppose they laugh in their sleeves at their master's being such a queer fish?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't think so; but it's so delightful, and at the same time such hard work, that one has no time to think about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how will you do about dining with them?
<p/>To  send you a bottle of Lafitte and roast turkey out there would be a little awkward.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'll simply come home at the time of their noonday rest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Next morning Konstantin Levin got up earlier than usual, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was detained giving directions on the farm, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) reached the mowing grass the mowers were already at their second row.
<p/>From the uplands he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could get a view of the shaded cut part of the meadow below, with its grayish ridges of cut grass, and the black heaps of coats, taken off by the mowers at the place from which they had started cutting.
<p/>Gradually, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) rode towards the meadow, the peasants came into sight, some in coats, some in their shirts mowing, one behind another in a long string, swinging their scythes differently.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) counted forty-two of them.
<p/>They were mowing slowly over the uneven, low-lying parts of the meadow, where there had been an old dam.
<p/>Levin recognized some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own men.
<p/>Here was old Yermil in a very long white smock, bending forward to swing a scythe; there was a young fellow, Vaska, who had been a coachman of Levin's, taking every row with a wide sweep.
<p/>Here, too, was Tit, Levin's preceptor in the art of mowing, a thin little peasant.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was in front of all, and cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wide row without bending, as though playing with the scythe.
<p/>Levin got off his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mare, and fastening her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) up by the roadside went to meet Tit, who took a second scythe out of a bush and gave it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's ready, sir; it's like a razor, cuts of itself,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Tit, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) cap with a smile and giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) the scythe.
<p/>Levin took the scythe, and began trying it.
<p/>As they finished their rows, the mowers, hot and good-humored, came out into the road one after another, and, laughing a little, greeted the master.
<p/>They all stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), but no one made any remark, till a tall old man, with a wrinkled, beardless face, wearing a short sheepskin jacket, came out into the road and accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look`ee now, master, once take hold of the rope there's no letting it go!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said, and Levin heard smothered laughter among the mowers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll try not to let it go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stand behind Tit, and waiting for the time to begin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind`ee,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>repeated the old man.
<p/>Tit made room, and Levin started behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>The grass was short close to the road, and Levin, who had not done any mowing for a long while, and was disconcerted by the eyes fastened upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), cut badly for the first moments, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) swung his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scythe vigorously.
<p/>Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard voices:  <div class="bookquote">``It's not set right; handle's too high; see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) has to stoop to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said one.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Press more on the heel,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'ll get on all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the old man resumed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s made a start....  You swing it too wide, you'll tire yourself out....
<p/>The master, sure, does his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) best for himself!
<p/>But see the grass missed out!
<p/>For such work us fellows would catch it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>The grass became softer, and Levin, listening without answering, followed Tit, trying to do the best he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could.
<p/>They moved a hundred paces.
<p/>Tit kept moving on, without stopping, not showing the slightest weariness, but Levin was already beginning to be afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would not be able to keep it up: he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was so tired.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) swung his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scythe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was at the very end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) strength, and was making up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind to ask Tit to stop.
<p/>But at that very moment Tit stopped of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own accord, and stooping down picked up some grass, rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scythe, and began whetting it.
<p/>Levin straightened himself, and drawing a deep breath looked round.
<p/>Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) came a peasant, and he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) too was evidently tired, for he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) stopped at once without waiting to mow up to Levin, and began whetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scythe.
<p/>Tit sharpened his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scythe and Levin's, and they went on.
<p/>The next time it was just the same.
<p/>Tit moved on with sweep after sweep of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scythe, not stopping nor showing signs of weariness.
<p/>Levin followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), trying not to get left behind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) found it harder and harder: the moment came when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had no strength left, but at that very moment Tit stopped and whetted the scythes.
<p/>So they mowed the first row.
<p/>And this long row seemed particularly hard work to Levin; but when the end was reached and Tit, shouldering his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scythe, began with deliberate stride returning on the tracks left by his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heels in the cut grass, and Levin walked back in the same way over the space he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had cut, in spite of the sweat that ran in streams over his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face and fell in drops down his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) nose, and drenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) back as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been soaked in water, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt very happy.
<p/>What delighted him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) particularly was that now he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would be able to hold out.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pleasure was only disturbed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) row not being well cut.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will swing less with my arm and more with my whole body,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought, comparing Tit's row, which looked as if it had been cut with a line, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own unevenly and irregularly lying grass.
<p/>The first row, as Levin noticed, Tit had mowed specially quickly, probably wishing to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) master to the test, and the row happened to be a long one.
<p/>The next rows were easier, but still Levin had to strain every nerve not to drop behind the peasants.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought of nothing, wished for nothing, but not to be left behind the peasants, and to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) work as well as possible.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard nothing but the swish of scythes, and saw before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) Tit's upright figure mowing away, the crescent-shaped curve of the cut grass, the grass and flower heads slowly and rhythmically falling before the blade of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scythe, and ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) the end of the row, where would come the rest.
<p/>Suddenly, in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) toil, without understanding what it was or whence it came, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt a pleasant sensation of chill on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hot, moist shoulders.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) glanced at the sky in the interval for whetting the scythes.
<p/>A heavy, lowering storm cloud had blown up, and big raindrops were falling.
<p/>Some of the peasants went to their coats and put them on; others--just like Levin himself--merely shrugged their shoulders, enjoying the pleasant coolness of it.
<p/>Another row, and yet another row, followed--long rows and short rows, with good grass and with poor grass.
<p/>Levin lost all sense of time, and could not have told whether it was late or early now.
<p/>A change began to come over his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) work, which gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) immense satisfaction.
<p/>In the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) toil there were moments during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) forgot what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was doing, and it came all easy to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and at those same moments his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) row was almost as smooth and well cut as Tit's.
<p/>But so soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) recollected what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was doing, and began trying to do better, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was at once conscious of all the difficulty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) task, and the row was badly mown.
<p/>On finishing yet another row he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would have gone back to the top of the meadow again to begin the next, but Tit stopped, and going up to the old man said something in a low voice to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>They both looked at the sun.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are they talking about, and why doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go back?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Levin, not guessing that the peasants had been mowing no less than four hours without stopping, and it was time for their lunch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lunch, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it really time?
<p/>That's right; lunch, then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scythe to Tit, and together with the peasants, who were crossing the long stretch of mown grass, slightly sprinkled with rain, to get their bread from the heap of coats, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) house.
<p/>Only then he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) suddenly awoke to the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been wrong about the weather and the rain was drenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hay.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The hay will be spoiled,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it, sir; mow in the rain, and you'll rake in fine weather!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>said the old man.
<p/>Levin untied his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) horse and rode home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) coffee.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch was only just getting up.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had drunk his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) coffee, Levin rode back again to the mowing before Sergey Ivanovitch had had time to dress and come down to the dining room.
<p/>Chapter 5   After lunch Levin was not in the same place in the string of mowers as before, but stood between the old man who had accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jocosely, and now invited him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbor, and a young peasant, who had only been married in the autumn, and who was mowing this summer for the first time.
<p/>The old man, holding himself erect, moved in front, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet turned out, taking long, regular strides, and with a precise and regular action which seemed to cost him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no more effort than swinging one's arms in walking, as though it were in play, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laid down the high, even row of grass.
<p/>It was as though it were not he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) but the sharp scythe of itself swishing through the juicy grass.
<p/>Behind Levin came the lad Mishka.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pretty, boyish face, with a twist of fresh grass bound round his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hair, was all working with effort; but whenever anyone looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) smiled.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would clearly have died sooner than own it was hard work for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Levin kept between them.
<p/>In the very heat of the day the mowing did not seem such hard work to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>The perspiration with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was drenched cooled him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), while the sun, that burned his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arms, bare to the elbow, gave a vigor and dogged energy to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) labor; and more and more often now came those moments of unconsciousness, when it was possible not to think what one was doing.
<p/>The scythe cut of itself.
<p/>These were happy moments.
<p/>Still more delightful were the moments when they reached the stream where the rows ended, and the old man rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scythe with the wet, thick grass, rinsed its blade in the fresh water of the stream, ladled out a little in a tin dipper, and offered Levin a drink.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say to my home-brew, eh?
<p/>Good, eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), winking.
<p/>And truly Levin had never drunk any liquor so good as this warm water with green bits floating in it, and a taste of rust from the tin dipper.
<p/>And immediately after this came the delicious, slow saunter, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand on the scythe, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could wipe away the streaming sweat, take deep breaths of air, and look about at the long string of mowers and at what was happening around in the forest and the country.
<p/>The longer Levin mowed, the oftener he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt the moments of unconsciousness in which it seemed not his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands that swung the scythe, but the scythe mowing of itself, a body full of life and consciousness of its own, and as though by magic, without thinking of it, the work turned out regular and well-finished of itself.
<p/>These were the most blissful moments.
<p/>It was only hard work when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to break off the motion, which had become unconscious, and to think; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to mow round a hillock or a tuft of sorrel.
<p/>The old man did this easily.
<p/>When a hillock came he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) action, and at one time with the heel, and at another with the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scythe, clipped the hillock round both sides with short strokes.
<p/>And while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept looking about and watching what came into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) view: at one moment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) picked a wild berry and ate it or offered it to Levin, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) flung away a twig with the blade of the scythe, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looked at a quail's nest, from which the bird flew just under the scythe, or caught a snake that crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) path, and lifting it on the scythe as though on a fork showed it to Levin and threw it away.
<p/>For both Levin and the young peasant behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), such changes of position were difficult.
<p/>Both of them, repeating over and over again the same strained movement, were in a perfect frenzy of toil, and were incapable of shifting their position and at the same time watching what was before them.
<p/>Levin did not notice how time was passing.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been asked how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been working he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would have said half an hour-- and it was getting on for dinner time.
<p/>As they were walking back over the cut grass, the old man called Levin's attention to the little girls and boys who were coming from different directions, hardly visible through the long grass, and along the road towards the mowers, carrying sacks of bread dragging at their little hands and pitchers of the sour rye-beer, with cloths wrapped round them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look`ee, the little emmets crawling!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, pointing to them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand to look at the sun.
<p/>They mowed two more rows; the old man stopped.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, master, dinner time!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said briskly.
<p/>And on reaching the stream the mowers moved off across the lines of cut grass towards their pile of coats, where the children who had brought their dinners were sitting waiting for them.
<p/>The peasants gathered into groups--those further away under a cart, those nearer under a willow bush.
<p/>Levin sat down by them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt disinclined to go away.
<p/>All constraint with the master had disappeared long ago.
<p/>The peasants got ready for dinner.
<p/>Some washed, the young lads bathed in the stream, others made a place comfortable for a rest, untied their sacks of bread, and uncovered the pitchers of rye-beer.
<p/>The old man crumbled up some bread in a cup, stirred it with the handle of a spoon, poured water on it from the dipper, broke up some more bread, and having seasoned it with salt, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned to the east to say his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prayer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, master, taste my sop,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), kneeling down before the cup.
<p/>The sop was so good that Levin gave up the idea of going home.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dined with the old man, and talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) family affairs, taking the keenest interest in them, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own affairs and all the circumstances that could be of interest to the old man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt much nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) than to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother, and could not help smiling at the affection he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt for this man.
<p/>When the old man got up again, said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prayer, and lay down under a bush, putting some grass under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head for a pillow, Levin did the same, and in spite of the clinging flies that were so persistent in the sunshine, and the midges that tickled his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hot face and body, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fell asleep at once and only waked when the sun had passed to the other side of the bush and reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>The old man had been awake a long while, and was sitting up whetting the scythes of the younger lads.
<p/>Levin looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and hardly recognized the place, everything was so changed.
<p/>The immense stretch of meadow had been mown and was sparkling with a peculiar fresh brilliance, with its lines of already sweet-smelling grass in the slanting rays of the evening sun.
<p/>And the bushes about the river had been cut down, and the river itself, not visible before, now gleaming like steel in its bends, and the moving, ascending, peasants, and the sharp wall of grass of the unmown part of the meadow, and the hawks hovering over the stripped meadow--all was perfectly new.
<p/>Raising himself, Levin began considering how much had been cut and how much more could still be done that day.
<p/>The work done was exceptionally much for forty-two men.
<p/>They had cut the whole of the big meadow, which had, in the years of serf labor, taken thirty scythes two days to mow.
<p/>Only the corners remained to do, where the rows were short.
<p/>But Levin felt a longing to get as much mowing done that day as possible, and was vexed with the sun sinking so quickly in the sky.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt no weariness; all he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wanted was to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) work done more and more quickly and as much done as possible.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Could you cut Mashkin Upland too?--what do you think?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to the old man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``As God wills, the sun's not high.
<p/>A little vodka for the lads?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>At the afternoon rest, when they were sitting down again, and those who smoked had lighted their pipes, the old man told the men that <div class="bookquote">``Mashkin Upland's to be cut--there'll be some vodka.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not cut it?
<p/>Come on, Tit!
<p/>We'll look sharp!
<p/>We can eat at night.
<p/>Come on!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>cried voices, and eating up their bread, the mowers went back to work.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, lads, keep it up!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>said Tit, and ran on ahead almost at a trot.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get along, get along!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>said the old man, hurrying after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and easily overtaking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I'll mow you down, look out!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And young and old mowed away, as though they were racing with one another.
<p/>But however fast they worked, they did not spoil the grass, and the rows were laid just as neatly and exactly.
<p/>The little piece left uncut in the corner was mown in five minutes.
<p/>The last of the mowers were just ending their rows while the foremost snatched up their coats onto their shoulders, and crossed the road towards Mashkin Upland.
<p/>The sun was already sinking into the trees when they went with their jingling dippers into the wooded ravine of Mashkin Upland.
<p/>The grass was up to their waists in the middle of the hollow, soft, tender, and feathery, spotted here and there among the trees with wild heart's-ease.
<p/>After a brief consultation--whether to take the rows lengthwise or diagonally--Prohor Yermilin, also a renowned mower, a huge, black-haired peasant, went on ahead.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) went up to the top, turned back again and started mowing, and they all proceeded to form in line behind him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>), going downhill through the hollow and uphill right up to the edge of the forest.
<p/>The sun sank behind the forest.
<p/>The dew was falling by now; the mowers were in the sun only on the hillside, but below, where a mist was rising, and on the opposite side, they mowed into the fresh, dewy shade.
<p/>The work went rapidly.
<p/>The grass cut with a juicy sound, and was at once laid in high, fragrant rows.
<p/>The mowers from all sides, brought closer together in the short row, kept urging one another on to the sound of jingling dippers and clanging scythes, and the hiss of the whetstones sharpening them, and good-humored shouts.
<p/>Levin still kept between the young peasant and the old man.
<p/>The old man, who had put on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) short sheepskin jacket, was just as good-humored, jocose, and free in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) movements.
<p/>Among the trees they were continually cutting with their scythes the so-called <div class="bookquote">``birch mushrooms,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>swollen fat in the succulent grass.
<p/>But the old man bent down every time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came across a mushroom, picked it up and put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bosom.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Another present for my old woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did so.
<p/>Easy as it was to mow the wet, soft grass, it was hard work going up and down the steep sides of the ravine.
<p/>But this did not trouble the old man.
<p/>Swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scythe just as ever, and moving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet in their big, plaited shoes with firm, little steps, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) climbed slowly up the steep place, and though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breeches hanging out below his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smock, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole frame trembled with effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not miss one blade of grass or one mushroom on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way, and kept making jokes with the peasants and Levin.
<p/>Levin walked after him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and often thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must fall, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) climbed with a scythe up a steep cliff where it would have been hard work to clamber without anything.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) climbed up and did what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to do.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt as though some external force were moving him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 6   Mashkin Upland was mown, the last row finished, the peasants had put on their coats and were gaily trudging home.
<p/>Levin got on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) horse and, parting regretfully from the peasants, rode homewards.
<p/>On the hillside he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looked back; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not see them in the mist that had risen from the valley; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could only hear rough, good-humored voices, laughter, and the sound of clanking scythes.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch had long ago finished dinner, and was drinking iced lemon and water in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) own room, looking through the reviews and papers which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had only just received by post, when Levin rushed into the room, talking merrily, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wet and matted hair sticking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) forehead, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) back and chest grimed and moist.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We mowed the whole meadow!
<p/>Oh, it is nice, delicious!
<p/>And how have you been getting on?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, completely forgetting the disagreeable conversation of the previous day.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy!
<p/>what do you look like!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>said Sergey Ivanovitch, for the first moment looking round with some dissatisfaction.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the door, do shut the door!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) cried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have let in a dozen at least.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>Sergey Ivanovitch could not endure flies, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) own room he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) never opened the window except at night, and carefully kept the door shut.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not one, on my honor.
<p/>But if I have, I'll catch them.
<p/>You wouldn't believe what a pleasure it is!
<p/>How have you spent the day?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well.
<p/>But have you really been mowing the whole day?
<p/>I expect you're as hungry as a wolf.
<p/>Kouzma has got everything ready for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't feel hungry even.
<p/>I had something to eat there.
<p/>But I'll go and wash.''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, go along, go along, and I'll come to you directly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) head as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go along, make haste,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) added smiling, and gathering up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) books, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) prepared to go too.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), too, felt suddenly good-humored and disinclined to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother's side.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what did you do while it was raining?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rain?
<p/>Why, there was scarcely a drop.
<p/>I'll come directly.
<p/>So you had a nice day too?
<p/>That's first-rate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>And Levin went off to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) clothes.
<p/>Five minutes later the brothers met in the dining room.
<p/>Although it seemed to Levin that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not hungry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sat down to dinner simply so as not to hurt Kouzma's feelings, yet when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began to eat the dinner struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) as extraordinarily good.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, by the way, there's a letter for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kouzma, bring it down, please.
<p/>And mind you shut the doors.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div><p/>The letter was from Oblonsky.
<p/>Levin read it aloud.
<p/>Oblonsky wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) from Petersburg:  <div class="bookquote">``I have had a letter from Dolly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)'s at Ergushovo, and everything seems going wrong there.
<p/>Do ride over and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), please; help her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) with advice; you know all about it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) will be so glad to see you.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)'s quite alone, poor thing.
<p/>My mother-in-law and all of them are still abroad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's capital!
<p/>I will certainly ride over to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or we'll go together.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>)'s such a splendid woman, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're not far from here, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty-five miles.
<p/>Or perhaps it is thirty.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be delighted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, still smiling.
<p/>The sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) younger brother's appearance had immediately put him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) in a good humor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you have an appetite!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) said, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) dark-red, sunburnt face and neck bent over the plate.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Splendid!
<p/>You can't imagine what an effectual remedy it is for every sort of foolishness.
<p/>I want to enrich medicine with a new word:  Arbeitskur .''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but you don't need it, I should fancy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but for all sorts of nervous invalids.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it ought to be tried.
<p/>I had meant to come to the mowing to look at you, but it was so unbearably hot that I got no further than the forest.
<p/>I sat there a little, and went on by the forest to the village, met your old nurse, and sounded her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) as to the peasants' view of you.
<p/>As far as I can make out, they don't approve of this.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said: `It's not a gentleman's work.'
<p/>Altogether, I fancy that in the people's ideas there are very clear and definite notions of certain, as they call it, `gentlemanly' lines of action.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe so; but anyway it's a pleasure such as I have never known in my life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help it if they don't like it.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>our conversation yesterday?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, blissfully dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyelids and drawing deep breaths after finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dinner, and absolutely incapable of recalling what their conversation yesterday was about.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you are partly right.
<p/>Our difference of opinion amounts to this, that you make the mainspring self-interest, while I suppose that interest in the common weal is bound to exist in every man of a certain degree of advancement.
<p/>Possibly you are right too, that action founded on material interest would be more desirable.
<p/>You are altogether, as the French say, too primesauti√®re  a nature; you must have intense, energetic action, or nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother and did not understand a single word, and did not want to understand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was only afraid his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother might ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) some question which would make it evident he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not heard.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So that's what I think it is, my dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) on the shoulder.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course.
<p/>But, do you know?
<p/>I won't stand up for my view,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin, with a guilty, childlike smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever was it I was disputing about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wondered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, I'm right, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s right, and it's all first-rate.
<p/>Only I must go round to the counting house and see to things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) got up, stretching and smiling.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch smiled too.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you want to go out, let's go together,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) said, disinclined to be parted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother, who seemed positively breathing out freshness and energy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, we'll go to the counting house, if you have to go there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, heavens!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>shouted Levin, so loudly that Sergey Ivanovitch was quite frightened.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, what is the matter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How's Agafea Mihalovna's hand?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, slapping himself on the head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd positively forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) even.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's much better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, anyway I'll run down to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>Before you've time to get your hat on, I'll be back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ran downstairs, clattering with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heels like a spring-rattle.
<p/>Chapter 7   Stephan Arkadyevitch had gone to Petersburg to perform the most natural and essential official duty--so familiar to everyone in the government service, though incomprehensible to outsiders-- that duty, but for which one could hardly be in government service, of reminding the ministry of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephan</b></font>) existence--and having, for the due performance of this rite, taken all the available cash from home, was gaily and agreeably spending his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephan</b></font>) days at the races and in the summer villas.
<p/>Meanwhile Dolly and the children had moved into the country, to cut down expenses as much as possible.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had gone to Ergushovo, the estate that had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) dowry, and the one where in spring the forest had been sold.
<p/>It was nearly forty miles from Levin's Pokrovskoe.
<p/>The big, old house at Ergushovo had been pulled down long ago, and the old prince had had the lodge done up and built on to.
<p/>Twenty years before, when Dolly was a child, the lodge had been roomy and comfortable, though, like all lodges, it stood sideways to the entrance avenue, and faced the south.
<p/>But by now this lodge was old and dilapidated.
<p/>When Stepan Arkadyevitch had gone down in the spring to sell the forest, Dolly had begged him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) to look over the house and order what repairs might be needed.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch, like all unfaithful husbands indeed, was very solicitous for his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) wife's comfort, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had himself looked over the house, and given instructions about everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) considered necessary.
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) considered necessary was to cover all the furniture with cretonne, to put up curtains, to weed the garden, to make a little bridge on the pond, and to plant flowers.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) forgot many other essential matters, the want of which greatly distressed Darya Alexandrovna later on.
<p/>In spite of Stepan Arkadyevitch's efforts to be an attentive father and husband, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) never could keep in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had a wife and children.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had bachelor tastes, and it was in accordance with them that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shaped his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) life.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) return to Moscow he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) informed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife with pride that everything was ready, that the house would be a little paradise, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) advised her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) most certainly to go.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's staying away in the country was very agreeable to Stepan Arkadyevitch from every point of view: it did the children good, it decreased expenses, and it left him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) more at liberty.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna regarded staying in the country for the summer as essential for the children, especially for the little girl, who had not succeeded in regaining her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) strength after the scarlatina, and also as a means of escaping the petty humiliations, the little bills owing to the wood-merchant, the fishmonger, the shoemaker, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) miserable.
<p/>Besides this, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was pleased to go away to the country because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was dreaming of getting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sister Kitty to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) there.
<p/>Kitty was to be back from abroad in the middle of the summer, and bathing had been prescribed for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>Kitty wrote that no prospect was so alluring as to spend the summer with Dolly at Ergushovo, full of childish associations for both of them.
<p/>The first days of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) existence in the country were very hard for Dolly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) used to stay in the country as a child, and the impression she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had retained of it was that the country was a refuge from all the unpleasantness of the town, that life there, though not luxurious--Dolly could easily make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) mind to that--was cheap and comfortable; that there was plenty of everything, everything was cheap, everything could be got, and children were happy.
<p/>But now coming to the country as the head of a family, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) perceived that it was all utterly unlike what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had fancied.
<p/>The day after their arrival there was a heavy fall of rain, and in the night the water came through in the corridor and in the nursery, so that the beds had to be carried into the drawing room.
<p/>There was no kitchen maid to be found; of the nine cows, it appeared from the words of the cowherd-woman that some were about to calve, others had just calved, others were old, and others again hard-uddered; there was not butter nor milk enough even for the children.
<p/>There were no eggs.
<p/>They could get no fowls; old, purplish, stringy cocks were all they had for roasting and boiling.
<p/>Impossible to get women to scrub the floors--all were potato-hoeing.
<p/>Driving was out of the question, because one of the horses was restive, and bolted in the shafts.
<p/>There was no place where they could bathe; the whole of the river-bank was trampled by the cattle and open to the road; even walks were impossible, for the cattle strayed into the garden through a gap in the hedge, and there was one terrible bull, who bellowed, and therefore might be expected to gore somebody.
<p/>There were no proper cupboards for their clothes; what cupboards there were either would not close at all, or burst open whenever anyone passed by them.
<p/>There were no pots and pans; there was no copper in the washhouse, nor even an ironing-board in the maids' room.
<p/>Finding instead of peace and rest all these, from her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) point of view, fearful calamities, Darya Alexandrovna was at first in despair.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) exerted herself to the utmost, felt the hopelessness of the position, and was every instant suppressing the tears that started into her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>The bailiff, a retired quartermaster, whom Stepan Arkadyevitch had taken a fancy to and had appointed bailiff on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) handsome and respectful appearance as a hall-porter, showed no sympathy for Darya Alexandrovna's woes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) said respectfully, <div class="bookquote">``nothing can be done, the peasants are such a wretched lot,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and did nothing to help her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>).
<p/>The position seemed hopeless.
<p/>But in the Oblonskys' household, as in all families indeed, there was one inconspicuous but most valuable and useful person, Marya Philimonovna.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) mistress, assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) that everything would  come round  -LRB-it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) expression, and Matvey had borrowed it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>)-RRB-, and without fuss or hurry proceeded to set to work herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) had immediately made friends with the bailiff's wife, and on the very first day she (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) drank tea with her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) and the bailiff under the acacias, and reviewed all the circumstances of the position.
<p/>Very soon Marya Philimonovna had established her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) club, so to say, under the acacias, and there it was, in this club, consisting of the bailiff's wife, the village elder, and the counting house clerk, that the difficulties of existence were gradually smoothed away, and in a week's time everything actually had come round.
<p/>The roof was mended, a kitchen maid was found--a crony of the village elder's--hens were bought, the cows began giving milk, the garden hedge was stopped up with stakes, the carpenter made a mangle, hooks were put in the cupboards, and they ceased to burst open spontaneously, and an ironing-board covered with army cloth was placed across from the arm of a chair to the chest of drawers, and there was a smell of flatirons in the maids' room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just see, now, and you were quite in despair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marya Philimonovna</b></font>)</div>said Marya Philimonovna, pointing to the ironing-board.
<p/>They even rigged up a bathing-shed of straw hurdles.
<p/>Lily began to bathe, and Darya Alexandrovna began to realize, if only in part, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) expectations, if not of a peaceful, at least of a comfortable, life in the country.
<p/>Peaceful with six children Darya Alexandrovna could not be.
<p/>One would fall ill, another might easily become so, a third would be without something necessary, a fourth would show symptoms of a bad disposition, and so on.
<p/>Rare indeed were the brief periods of peace.
<p/>But these cares and anxieties were for Darya Alexandrovna the sole happiness possible.
<p/>Had it not been for them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) would have been left alone to brood over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) husband who did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>).
<p/>And besides, hard though it was for the mother to bear the dread of illness, the illnesses themselves, and the grief of seeing signs of evil propensities in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children--the children themselves were even now repaying her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in small joys for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sufferings.
<p/>Those joys were so small that they passed unnoticed, like gold in sand, and at bad moments she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could see nothing but the pain, nothing but sand; but there were good moments too when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw nothing but the joy, nothing but gold.
<p/>Now in the solitude of the country, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began to be more and more frequently aware of those joys.
<p/>Often, looking at them, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would make every possible effort to persuade herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was mistaken, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as a mother was partial to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children.
<p/>All the same, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not help saying to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had charming children, all six of them in different ways, but a set of children such as is not often to be met with, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was happy in them, and proud of them.
<p/>Chapter 8   Towards the end of May, when everything had been more or less satisfactorily arranged, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) received her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband's answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) complaints of the disorganized state of things in the country.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wrote begging her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) forgiveness for not having thought of everything before, and promised to come down at the first chance.
<p/>This chance did not present itself, and till the beginning of June Darya Alexandrovna stayed alone in the country.
<p/>On the Sunday in St. Peter's week Darya Alexandrovna drove to mass for all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children to take the sacrament.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) intimate, philosophical talks with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sister, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) friends very often astonished them by the freedom of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) views in regard to religion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had a strange religion of transmigration of souls all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had firm faith, troubling herself little about the dogmas of the Church.
<p/>But in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) family she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was strict in carrying out all that was required by the Church--and not merely in order to set an example, but with all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart in it.
<p/>The fact that the children had not been at the sacrament for nearly a year worried her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) extremely, and with the full approval and sympathy of Marya Philimonovna she (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) decided that this should take place now in the summer.
<p/>For several days before, Darya Alexandrovna was busily deliberating on how to dress all the children.
<p/>Frocks were made or altered and washed, seams and flounces were let out, buttons were sewn on, and ribbons got ready.
<p/>One dress, Tanya's, which the English governess had undertaken, cost Darya Alexandrovna much loss of temper.
<p/>The English governess in altering it had made the seams in the wrong place, had taken up the sleeves too much, and altogether spoilt the dress.
<p/>It was so narrow on Tanya's shoulders that it was quite painful to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>).
<p/>But Marya Philimonovna had the happy thought of putting in gussets, and adding a little shoulder-cape.
<p/>The dress was set right, but there was nearly a quarrel with the English governess.
<p/>On the morning, however, all was happily arranged, and towards ten o'clock--the time at which they had asked the priest to wait for them for the mass--the children in their new dresses, with beaming faces, stood on the step before the carriage waiting for their mother.
<p/>To the carriage, instead of the restive Raven, they had harnessed, thanks to the representations of Marya Philimonovna, the bailiff's horse, Brownie, and Darya Alexandrovna, delayed by anxiety over her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) own attire, came out and got in, dressed in a white muslin gown.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) hair, and dressed with care and excitement.
<p/>In the old days she (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) had dressed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) own sake to look pretty and be admired.
<p/>Later on, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) got older, dress became more and more distasteful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) was losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) good looks.
<p/>But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) began to feel pleasure and interest in dress again.
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) did not dress for her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) own sake, not for the sake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) own beauty, but simply that as the mother of those exquisite creatures she (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) might not spoil the general effect.
<p/>And looking at herself for the last time in the looking-glass she (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) was satisfied with herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) looked nice.
<p/>Not nice as she (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) would have wished to look nice in old days at a ball, but nice for the object which she (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) now had in view.
<p/>In the church there was no one but the peasants, the servants and their women-folk.
<p/>But Darya Alexandrovna saw, or fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) saw, the sensation produced by her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) children and her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>).
<p/>The children were not only beautiful to look at in their smart little dresses, but they were charming in the way they behaved.
<p/>Aliosha, it is true, did not stand quite correctly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) kept turning round, trying to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) little jacket from behind; but all the same he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) was wonderfully sweet.
<p/>Tanya behaved like a grownup person, and looked after the little ones.
<p/>And the smallest, Lily, was bewitching in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) na√Øve astonishment at everything, and it was difficult not to smile when, after taking the sacrament, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) said in English, <div class="bookquote">``Please, some more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>On the way home the children felt that something solemn had happened, and were very sedate.
<p/>Everything went happily at home too; but at lunch Grisha began whistling, and, what was worse, was disobedient to the English governess, and was forbidden to have any tart.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna would not have let things go so far on such a day had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) been present; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had to support the English governess's authority, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) upheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) decision that Grisha should have no tart.
<p/>This rather spoiled the general good humor.
<p/>Grisha cried, declaring that Nikolinka had whistled too, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grisha</b></font>) was not punished, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grisha</b></font>) wasn't crying for the tart--he (<font color='blue'><b>Grisha</b></font>) didn't care--but at being unjustly treated.
<p/>This was really too tragic, and Darya Alexandrovna made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) mind to persuade the English governess to forgive Grisha, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) went to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>).
<p/>But on the way, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) passed the drawing room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) beheld a scene, filling her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) heart with such pleasure that the tears came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) forgave the delinquent herself.
<p/>The culprit was sitting at the window in the corner of the drawing room; beside him (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) was standing Tanya with a plate.
<p/>On the pretext of wanting to give some dinner to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) dolls, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) had asked the governess's permission to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) share of tart to the nursery, and had taken it instead to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) brother.
<p/>While still weeping over the injustice of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) punishment, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was eating the tart, and kept saying through his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sobs, <div class="bookquote">``Eat yourself; let's eat it together...together.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Tanya had at first been under the influence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) pity for Grisha, then of a sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) noble action, and tears were standing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) eyes too; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) did not refuse, and ate her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) share.
<p/>On catching sight of their mother they were dismayed, but, looking into her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) face, they saw they were not doing wrong.
<p/>They burst out laughing, and, with their mouths full of tart, they began wiping their smiling lips with their hands, and smearing their radiant faces all over with tears and jam.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy!
<p/>Your new white frock!
<p/>Tanya!
<p/>Grisha!''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>said their mother, trying to save the frock, but with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) eyes, smiling a blissful, rapturous smile.
<p/>The new frocks were taken off, and orders were given for the little girls to have their blouses put on, and the boys their old jackets, and the wagonette to be harnessed; with Brownie, to the bailiff's annoyance, again in the shafts, to drive out for mushroom picking and bathing.
<p/>A roar of delighted shrieks arose in the nursery, and never ceased till they had set off for the bathing-place.
<p/>They gathered a whole basketful of mushrooms; even Lily found a birch mushroom.
<p/>It had always happened before that Miss Hoole found them and pointed them out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hoole</b></font>); but this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Hoole</b></font>) found a big one quite of herself, and there was a general scream of delight, <div class="bookquote">``Lily has found a mushroom!''
 (<font color='red'><b>a scream</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they reached the river, put the horses under the birch trees, and went to the bathing-place.
<p/>The coachman, Terenty, fastened the horses, who kept whisking away the flies, to a tree, and, treading down the grass, lay down in the shade of a birch and smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) shag, while the never-ceasing shrieks of delight of the children floated across to him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) from the bathing-place.
<p/>Though it was hard work to look after all the children and restrain their wild pranks, though it was difficult too to keep in one's head and not mix up all the stockings, little breeches, and shoes for the different legs, and to undo and to do up again all the tapes and buttons, Darya Alexandrovna, who had always liked bathing herself, and believed it to be very good for the children, enjoyed nothing so much as bathing with all the children.
<p/>To go over all those fat little legs, pulling on their stockings, to take in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) arms and dip those little naked bodies, and to hear their screams of delight and alarm, to see the breathless faces with wide-open, scared, and happy eyes of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) splashing cherubs, was a great pleasure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>).
<p/>When half the children had been dressed, some peasant women in holiday dress, out picking herbs, came up to the bathing-shed and stopped shyly.
<p/>Marya Philimonovna called one of them and handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) a sheet and a shirt that had dropped into the water for her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) to dry them, and Darya Alexandrovna began to talk to the women.
<p/>At first they laughed behind their hands and did not understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) questions, but soon they grew bolder and began to talk, winning Darya Alexandrovna's heart at once by the genuine admiration of the children that they showed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My, what a beauty!
<p/>as white as sugar,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one, admiring Tanitchka, and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">``but thin...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) has been ill.''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And so they've been bathing you too,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baby</b></font>)</div>said another to the baby.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>)'s only three months old,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>answered Darya Alexandrovna with pride.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't say so!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And have you any children?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've had four; I've two living--a boy and a girl.
<p/>I weaned her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) last carnival.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How old is she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, two years old.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) so long?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's our custom; for three fasts...''   (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>And the conversation became most interesting to Darya Alexandrovna.
<p/>What sort of time did she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) have?
<p/>What was the matter with the boy?
<p/>Where was her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) husband?
<p/>Did it often happen?
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna felt disinclined to leave the peasant women, so interesting to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was their conversation, so completely identical were all their interests.
<p/>What pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) most of all was that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) saw clearly what all the women admired more than anything was her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) having so many children, and such fine ones.
<p/>The peasant women even made Darya Alexandrovna laugh, and offended the English governess, because she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was the cause of the laughter she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) did not understand.
<p/>One of the younger women kept staring at the Englishwoman, who was dressing after all the rest, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) third petticoat she (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) could not refrain from the remark, <div class="bookquote">``My, she (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) keeps putting on and putting on, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>)'ll never have done!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) said, and they all went off into roars.
<p/>Chapter 9   On the drive home, as Darya Alexandrovna, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) children round her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>), their heads still wet from their bath, and a kerchief tied over her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) own head, was getting near the house, the coachman said, <div class="bookquote">``There's some gentleman coming:  the master of Pokrovskoe, I do believe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div><p/>Darya Alexandrovna peeped out in front, and was delighted when she (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) recognized in the gray hat and gray coat the familiar figure of Levin walking to meet them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) was glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) at any time, but at this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) was specially glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) should see her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) glory.
<p/>No one was better able to appreciate her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) grandeur than Levin.
<p/>Seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) found himself face to face with one of the pictures of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) daydream of family life.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're like a hen with your chickens, Darya Alexandrovna.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, how glad I am to see you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) said, holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad to see me, but you didn't let me know.
<p/>My brother's staying with me.
<p/>I got a note from Stiva that you were here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From Stiva?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>Darya Alexandrovna asked with surprise.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) writes that you are here, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thinks you might allow me to be of use to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said it he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) became suddenly embarrassed, and, stopping abruptly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) walked on in silence by the wagonette, snapping off the buds of the lime trees and nibbling them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was embarrassed through a sense that Darya Alexandrovna would be annoyed by receiving from an outsider help that should by rights have come from her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own husband.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna certainly did not like this little way of Stepan Arkadyevitch's of foisting his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) domestic duties on others.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was at once aware that Levin was aware of this.
<p/>It was just for this fineness of perception, for this delicacy, that Darya Alexandrovna liked Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, <div class="bookquote">``that that simply means that you would like to see me, and I'm exceedingly glad.
<p/>Though I can fancy that, used to town housekeeping as you are, you must feel in the wilds here, and if there's anything wanted, I'm altogether at your disposal.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At first things were rather uncomfortable, but now we've settled everything capitally-- thanks to my old nurse,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said, indicating Marya Philimonovna, who, seeing that they were speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>), smiled brightly and cordially to Levin.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would be a good match for her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) young lady, and was very keen to see the matter settled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you get in, sir, we'll make room this side!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'll walk.
<p/>Children, who'd like to race the horses with me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The children</b></font>)</div><p/>The children knew Levin very little, and could not remember when they had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), but they experienced in regard to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) none of that strange feeling of shyness and hostility which children so often experience towards hypocritical, grown-up people, and for which they are so often and miserably punished.
<p/>Hypocrisy in anything whatever may deceive the cleverest and most penetrating man, but the least wide-awake of children recognizes it, and is revolted by it, however ingeniously it may be disguised.
<p/>Whatever faults Levin had, there was not a trace of hypocrisy in him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and so the children showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) the same friendliness that they saw in their mother's face.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) invitation, the two elder ones at once jumped out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and ran with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) as simply as they would have done with their nurse or Miss Hoole or their mother.
<p/>Lily, too, began begging to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) mother handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sat her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shoulder and ran along with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, Darya Alexandrovna!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, smiling good-humoredly to the mother; <div class="bookquote">``there's no chance of my hurting or dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/>And, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) strong, agile, assiduously careful and needlessly wary movements, the mother felt her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind at rest, and smiled gaily and approvingly as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Here, in the country, with children, and with Darya Alexandrovna, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was in sympathy, Levin was in a mood not infrequent with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), of childlike light-heartedness that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) particularly liked in him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ran with the children, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) taught them gymnastic feats, set Miss Hoole laughing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) queer English accent, and talked to Darya Alexandrovna of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pursuits in the country.
<p/>After dinner, Darya Alexandrovna, sitting alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) on the balcony, began to speak of Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, Kitty's coming here, and is going to spend the summer with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, flushing, and at once, to change the conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Then I'll send you two cows, shall I?
<p/>If you insist on a bill you shall pay me five roubles a month; but it's really too bad of you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you.
<p/>We can manage very well now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, then, I'll have a look at your cows, and if you'll allow me, I'll give directions about their food.
<p/>Everything depends on their food.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>And Levin, to turn the conversation, explained to Darya Alexandrovna the theory of cow-keeping, based on the principle that the cow is simply a machine for the transformation of food into milk, and so on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) talked of this, and passionately longed to hear more of Kitty, and, at the same time, was afraid of hearing it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dreaded the breaking up of the inward peace he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had gained with such effort.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is there to look after it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>Darya Alexandrovna responded, without interest.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had by now got her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) household matters so satisfactorily arranged, thanks to Marya Philimonovna, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) was disinclined to make any change in them; besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) had no faith in Levin's knowledge of farming.
<p/>General principles, as to the cow being a machine for the production of milk, she (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) looked on with suspicion.
<p/>It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) that such principles could only be a hindrance in farm management.
<p/>It all seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Philimonovna</b></font>) a far simpler matter: all that was needed, as Marya Philimonovna had explained, was to give Brindle and Whitebreast more food and drink, and not to let the cook carry all the kitchen slops to the laundry maid's cow.
<p/>That was clear.
<p/>But general propositions as to feeding on meal and on grass were doubtful and obscure.
<p/>And, what was most important, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) wanted to talk about Kitty.
<p/>Chapter 10   <div class="bookquote">``Kitty writes to me that there's nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) longs for so much as quiet and solitude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>Dolly said after the silence that had followed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how is she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)--better?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin asked in agitation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)'s quite well again.
<p/>I never believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) lungs were affected.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm very glad!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, and Dolly fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) saw something touching, helpless, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said this and looked silently into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me ask you, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>said Darya Alexandrovna, smiling her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) kindly and rather mocking smile, <div class="bookquote">``why is it you are angry with Kitty?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I?
<p/>I'm not angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you are angry.
<p/>Why was it you did not come to see us nor them when you were in Moscow?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Darya Alexandrovna,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, blushing up to the roots of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hair, <div class="bookquote">``I wonder really that with your kind heart you don't feel this.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I made an offer and that I was refused,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, and all the tenderness he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been feeling for Kitty a minute before was replaced by a feeling of anger for the slight he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had suffered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes you suppose I know?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because everybody knows it...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's just where you are mistaken; I did not know it, though I had guessed it was so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All I knew was that something had happened that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) dreadfully miserable, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) begged me never to speak of it.

(<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, <div class="bookquote">``but...''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), poor girl...I am awfully, awfully sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Darya Alexandrovna, you must excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, getting up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Darya Alexandrovna, till we meet again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, wait a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, clutching him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) by the sleeve.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute, sit down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, please, don't let us talk of this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, sitting down, and at the same time feeling rise up and stir within his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart a hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had believed to be buried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I did not like you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, and tears came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes; <div class="bookquote">``if I did not know you, as I do know you .
<p/>.
<p/>.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The feeling that had seemed dead revived more and more, rose up and took possession of Levin's heart.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I understand it all now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>said Darya Alexandrovna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't understand it; for you men, who are free and make your own choice, it's always clear whom you love.
<p/>But a girl's in a position of suspense, with all a woman's or maiden's modesty, a girl who sees you men from afar, who takes everything on trust,-- a girl may have, and often has, such a feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cannot tell what to say.''

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's not quite it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyway you make an offer, when your love is ripe or when the balance has completely turned between the two you are choosing from.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to choose between me and Vronsky,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>thought Levin, and the dead thing that had come to life within him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) died again, and only weighed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart and set it aching.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Darya Alexandrovna,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that's how one chooses a new dress or some purchase or other, not love.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, pride, pride!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Darya Alexandrovna, as though despising him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) for the baseness of this feeling in comparison with that other feeling which only women know.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At the time when you made Kitty an offer she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was just in a position in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not answer.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was in doubt.
<p/>Doubt between you and Vronsky.
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was seeing every day, and you she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had not seen for a long while.
<p/>Supposing she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had been older...I, for instance, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) place could have felt no doubt.
<p/>I always disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and so it has turned out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin recalled Kitty's answer.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had said: '' No, that cannot be ...''  <div class="bookquote">``Darya Alexandrovna,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said dryly, <div class="bookquote">``I appreciate your confidence in me; I believe you are making a mistake.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, jumping up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you only knew how you are hurting me.
<p/>It's just as if a child of yours were dead, and they were to say to you: He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would have been like this and like that, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) might have lived, and how happy you would have been in him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s dead, dead, dead!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How absurd you are!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Darya Alexandrovna, looking with mournful tenderness at Levin's excitement.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I see it all more and more clearly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) went on musingly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you won't come to see us, then, when Kitty's here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I shan't come.
<p/>Of course I won't avoid meeting Katerina Alexandrovna, but as far as I can, I will try to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) the annoyance of my presence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very, very absurd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>repeated Darya Alexandrovna, looking with tenderness into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well then, let it be as though we had not spoken of this.
<p/>What have you come for, Tanya?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) said in French to the little girl who had come in.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's my spade, mamma?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I speak French, and you must too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The little girl tried to say it in French, but could not remember the French for spade; the mother prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and then told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in French where to look for the spade.
<p/>And this made a disagreeable impression on Levin.
<p/>Everything in Darya Alexandrovna's house and children struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) now as by no means so charming as a little while before.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what does she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) talk French with the children for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``how unnatural and false it is!
<p/>And the children feel it so: Learning French and unlearning sincerity,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought to himself, unaware that Darya Alexandrovna had thought all that over twenty times already, and yet, even at the cost of some loss of sincerity, believed it necessary to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children French in that way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why are you going?
<p/>Do stay a little.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin stayed to tea; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) good-humor had vanished, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt ill at ease.
<p/>After tea he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went out into the hall to order his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) horses to be put in, and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) came back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) found Darya Alexandrovna greatly disturbed, with a troubled face, and tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>While Levin had been outside, an incident had occurred which had utterly shattered all the happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been feeling that day, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pride in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children.
<p/>Grisha and Tanya had been fighting over a ball.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna, hearing a scream in the nursery, ran in and saw a terrible sight.
<p/>Tanya was pulling Grisha's hair, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), with a face hideous with rage, was beating her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fists wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could get at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>).
<p/>Something snapped in Darya Alexandrovna's heart when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) saw this.
<p/>It was as if darkness had swooped down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) life; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) felt that these children of hers, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) was so proud of, were not merely most ordinary, but positively bad, ill-bred children, with coarse, brutal propensities--wicked children.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) could not talk or think of anything else, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) could not speak to Levin of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) misery.
<p/>Levin saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) was unhappy and tried to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>), saying that it showed nothing bad, that all children fight; but, even as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was thinking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart: <div class="bookquote">``No, I won't be artificial and talk French with my children; but my children won't be like that.
<p/>All one has to do is not spoil children, not to distort their nature, and they'll be delightful.
<p/>No, my children won't be like that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said good-bye and drove away, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) did not try to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 11   In the middle of July the elder of the village on Levin's sister's estate, about fifteen miles from Pokrovskoe, came to Levin to report on how things were going there and on the hay.
<p/>The chief source of income on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sister's estate was from the riverside meadows.
<p/>In former years the hay had been bought by the peasants for twenty roubles the three acres.
<p/>When Levin took over the management of the estate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought on examining the grasslands that they were worth more, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fixed the price at twenty-five roubles the three acres.
<p/>The peasants would not give that price, and, as Levin suspected, kept off other purchasers.
<p/>Then Levin had driven over himself, and arranged to have the grass cut, partly by hired labor, partly at a payment of a certain proportion of the crop.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own peasants put every hindrance they could in the way of this new arrangement, but it was carried out, and the first year the meadows had yielded a profit almost double.
<p/>The previous year--which was the third year--the peasants had maintained the same opposition to the arrangement, and the hay had been cut on the same system.
<p/>This year the peasants were doing all the mowing for a third of the hay crop, and the village elder had come now to announce that the hay had been cut, and that, fearing rain, they had invited the counting-house clerk over, had divided the crop in his (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) presence, and had raked together eleven stacks as the owner's share.
<p/>From the vague answers to his (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) question how much hay had been cut on the principal meadow, from the hurry of the village elder who had made the division, not asking leave, from the whole tone of the peasant, Levin perceived that there was something wrong in the division of the hay, and made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind to drive over himself to look into the matter.
<p/>Arriving for dinner at the village, and leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) horse at the cottage of an old friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), the husband of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's wet-nurse, Levin went to see the old man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bee-house, wanting to find out from him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) the truth about the hay.
<p/>Parmenitch, a talkative, comely old man, gave Levin a very warm welcome, showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) all he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was doing, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) everything about his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bees and the swarms of that year; but gave vague and unwilling answers to Levin's inquiries about the mowing.
<p/>This confirmed Levin still more in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) suspicions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went to the hay fields and examined the stacks.
<p/>The haystacks could not possibly contain fifty wagon-loads each, and to convict the peasants Levin ordered the wagons that had carried the hay to be brought up directly, to lift one stack, and carry it into the barn.
<p/>There turned out to be only thirty-two loads in the stack.
<p/>In spite of the village elder's assertions about the compressibility of hay, and its having settled down in the stacks, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) swearing that everything had been done in the fear of God, Levin stuck to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) point that the hay had been divided without his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) orders, and that, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would not accept that hay as fifty loads to a stack.
<p/>After a prolonged dispute the matter was decided by the peasants taking these eleven stacks, reckoning them as fifty loads each.
<p/>The arguments and the division of the haycocks lasted the whole afternoon.
<p/>When the last of the hay had been divided, Levin, intrusting the superintendence of the rest to the counting-house clerk, sat down on a haycock marked off by a stake of willow, and looked admiringly at the meadow swarming with peasants.
<p/>In front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), in the bend of the river beyond the marsh, moved a bright-colored line of peasant women, and the scattered hay was being rapidly formed into gray winding rows over the pale green stubble.
<p/>After the women came the men with pitchforks, and from the gray rows there were growing up broad, high, soft haycocks.
<p/>To the left, carts were rumbling over the meadow that had been already cleared, and one after another the haycocks vanished, flung up in huge forkfuls, and in their place there were rising heavy cartloads of fragrant hay hanging over the horses' hind-quarters.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What weather for haying!
<p/>What hay it'll be!''
 (<font color='red'><b>an man</b></font>)</div><p/>said an old man, squatting down beside Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's tea, not hay!
<p/>It's like scattering grain to the ducks, the way they pick it up!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) added, pointing to the growing haycocks.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since dinnertime they've carried a good half of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The last load, eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shouted to a young peasant, who drove by, standing in the front of an empty cart, shaking the cord reins.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The last, dad!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div><p/>the lad shouted back, pulling in the horse, and, smiling, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) looked round at a bright, rosy-checked peasant girl who sat in the cart smiling too, and drove on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's that?
<p/>Your son?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My baby,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man with a tender smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a fine fellow!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The lad's all right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Married already?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's two years last St. Philip's day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any children?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Children indeed!
<p/>Why, for over a year he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was innocent as a babe himself, and bashful too,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the old man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, the hay!
<p/>It's as fragrant as tea!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repeated, wishing to change the subject.
<p/>Levin looked more attentively at Ivan Parmenov and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife.
<p/>They were loading a haycock onto the cart not far from him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Ivan Parmenov was standing on the cart, taking, laying in place, and stamping down the huge bundles of hay, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Parmenov</b></font>) pretty young wife deftly handed up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Parmenov</b></font>), at first in armfuls, and then on the pitchfork.
<p/>The young wife worked easily, merrily, and dexterously.
<p/>The close-packed hay did not once break away off her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fork.
<p/>First she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gathered it together, stuck the fork into it, then with a rapid, supple movement leaned the whole weight of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) body on it, and at once with a bend of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) back under the red belt she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) drew herself up, and arching her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) full bosom under the white smock, with a smart turn swung the fork in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arms, and flung the bundle of hay high onto the cart.
<p/>Ivan, obviously doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) best to save her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) every minute of unnecessary labor, made haste, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) arms to clutch the bundle and lay it in the cart.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) raked together what was left of the hay, the young wife shook off the bits of hay that had fallen on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) neck, and straightening the red kerchief that had dropped forward over her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) white brow, not browned like her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face by the sun, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) crept under the cart to tie up the load.
<p/>Ivan directed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) how to fasten the cord to the cross-piece, and at something she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) laughed aloud.
<p/>In the expressions of both faces was to be seen vigorous, young, freshly awakened love.
<p/>Chapter 12   The load was tied on.
<p/>Ivan jumped down and took the quiet, sleek horse by the bridle.
<p/>The young wife flung the rake up on the load, and with a bold step, swinging her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arms, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went to join the women, who were forming a ring for the haymakers' dance.
<p/>Ivan drove off to the road and fell into line with the other loaded carts.
<p/>The peasant women, with their rakes on their shoulders, gay with bright flowers, and chattering with ringing, merry voices, walked behind the hay cart.
<p/>One wild untrained female voice broke into a song, and sang it alone through a verse, and then the same verse was taken up and repeated by half a hundred strong healthy voices, of all sorts, coarse and fine, singing in unison.
<p/>The women, all singing, began to come close to Levin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt as though a storm were swooping down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with a thunder of merriment.
<p/>The storm swooped down, enveloped him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and the haycock on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was lying, and the other haycocks, and the wagon-loads, and the whole meadow and distant fields all seemed to be shaking and singing to the measures of this wild merry song with its shouts and whistles and clapping.
<p/>Levin felt envious of this health and mirthfulness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) longed to take part in the expression of this joy of life.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could do nothing, and had to lie and look on and listen.
<p/>When the peasants, with their singing, had vanished out of sight and hearing, a weary feeling of despondency at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own isolation, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) physical inactivity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) alienation from this world, came over Levin.
<p/>Some of the very peasants who had been most active in wrangling with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) over the hay, some whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had treated with contumely, and who had tried to cheat him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), those very peasants had greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) goodhumoredly, and evidently had not, were incapable of having any feeling of rancor against him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), any regret, any recollection even of having tried to deceive him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>All that was drowned in a sea of merry common labor.
<p/>God gave the day, God gave the strength.
<p/>And the day and the strength were consecrated to labor, and that labor was its own reward.
<p/>For whom the labor?
<p/>What would be its fruits?
<p/>These were idle considerations-- beside the point.
<p/>Often Levin had admired this life, often he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had a sense of envy of the men who led this life; but today for the first time, especially under the influence of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had seen in the attitude of Ivan Parmenov to his (<font color='blue'><b>Parmenov</b></font>) young wife, the idea presented itself definitely to his (<font color='blue'><b>Parmenov</b></font>) mind that it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Parmenov</b></font>) power to exchange the dreary, artificial, idle, and individualistic life he (<font color='blue'><b>Parmenov</b></font>) was leading for this laborious, pure, and socially delightful life.
<p/>The old man who had been sitting beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had long ago gone home; the people had all separated.
<p/>Those who lived near had gone home, while those who came from far were gathered into a group for supper, and to spend the night in the meadow.
<p/>Levin, unobserved by the peasants, still lay on the haycock, and still looked on and listened and mused.
<p/>The peasants who remained for the night in the meadow scarcely slept all the short summer night.
<p/>At first there was the sound of merry talk and laughing all together over the supper, then singing again and laughter.
<p/>All the long day of toil had left no trace in them but lightness of heart.
<p/>Before the early dawn all was hushed.
<p/>Nothing was to be heard but the night sounds of the frogs that never ceased in the marsh, and the horses snorting in the mist that rose over the meadow before the morning.
<p/>Rousing himself, Levin got up from the haycock, and looking at the stars, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw that the night was over.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what am I going to do?
<p/>How am I to set about it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to himself, trying to express to himself all the thoughts and feelings he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had passed through in that brief night.
<p/>All the thoughts and feelings he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had passed through fell into three separate trains of thought.
<p/>One was the renunciation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) old life, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) utterly useless education.
<p/>This renunciation gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) satisfaction, and was easy and simple.
<p/>Another series of thoughts and mental images related to the life he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) longed to live now.
<p/>The simplicity, the purity, the sanity of this life he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt clearly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would find in it the content, the peace, and the dignity, of the lack of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was so miserably conscious.
<p/>But a third series of ideas turned upon the question how to effect this transition from the old life to the new.
<p/>And there nothing took clear shape for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have a wife?
<p/>Have work and the necessity of work?
<p/>Leave Pokrovskoe?
<p/>Buy land?
<p/>Become a member of a peasant community?
<p/>Marry a peasant girl?
<p/>How am I to set about it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) asked himself again, and could not find an answer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't slept all night, though, and I can't think it out clearly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) said to himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll work it out later.
<p/>One thing's certain, this night has decided my fate.
<p/>All my old dreams of home life were absurd, not the real thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) told himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all ever so much simpler and better...''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How beautiful!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) thought, looking at the strange, as it were, mother-of-pearl shell of white fleecy cloudlets resting right over his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) head in the middle of the sky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How exquisite it all is in this exquisite night!
<p/>And when was there time for that cloud-shell to form?
<p/>Just now I looked at the sky, and there was nothing in it--only two white streaks.
<p/>Yes, and so imperceptibly too my views of life changed!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) went out of the meadow and walked along the highroad towards the village.
<p/>A slight wind arose, and the sky looked gray and sullen.
<p/>The gloomy moment had come that usually precedes the dawn, the full triumph of light over darkness.
<p/>Shrinking from the cold, Levin walked rapidly, looking at the ground.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?
<p/>Someone coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought, catching the tinkle of bells, and lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head.
<p/>Forty paces from him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) a carriage with four horses harnessed abreast was driving towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) along the grassy road on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was walking.
<p/>The shaft-horses were tilted against the shafts by the ruts, but the dexterous driver sitting on the box held the shaft over the ruts, so that the wheels ran on the smooth part of the road.
<p/>This was all Levin noticed, and without wondering who it could be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gazed absently at the coach.
<p/>In the coach was an old lady dozing in one corner, and at the window, evidently only just awake, sat a young girl holding in both hands the ribbons of a white cap.
<p/>With a face full of light and thought, full of a subtle, complex inner life, that was remote from Levin, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was gazing beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) at the glow of the sunrise.
<p/>At the very instant when this apparition was vanishing, the truthful eyes glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face lighted up with wondering delight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not be mistaken.
<p/>There were no other eyes like those in the world.
<p/>There was only one creature in the world that could concentrate for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) all the brightness and meaning of life.
<p/>It was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>It was Kitty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was driving to Ergushovo from the railway station.
<p/>And everything that had been stirring Levin during that sleepless night, all the resolutions he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had made, all vanished at once.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) recalled with horror his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dreams of marrying a peasant girl.
<p/>There only, in the carriage that had crossed over to the other side of the road, and was rapidly disappearing, there only could he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) find the solution of the riddle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) life, which had weighed so agonizingly upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) of late.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not look out again.
<p/>The sound of the carriage-springs was no longer audible, the bells could scarcely be heard.
<p/>The barking of dogs showed the carriage had reached the village, and all that was left was the empty fields all round, the village in front, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) himself isolated and apart from it all, wandering lonely along the deserted highroad.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) glanced at the sky, expecting to find there the cloud shell he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been admiring and taking as the symbol of the ideas and feelings of that night.
<p/>There was nothing in the sky in the least like a shell.
<p/>There, in the remote heights above, a mysterious change had been accomplished.
<p/>There was no trace of shell, and there was stretched over fully half the sky an even cover of tiny and ever tinier cloudlets.
<p/>The sky had grown blue and bright; and with the same softness, but with the same remoteness, it met his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) questioning gaze.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``however good that life of simplicity and toil may be, I cannot go back to it.
<p/>I love  her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) .''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 13   None but those who were most intimate with Alexey Alexandrovitch knew that, while on the surface the coldest and most reasonable of men, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had one weakness quite opposed to the general trend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) character.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch could not hear or see a child or woman crying without being moved.
<p/>The sight of tears threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) into a state of nervous agitation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) utterly lost all power of reflection.
<p/>The chief secretary of his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) department and his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) private secretary were aware of this, and used to warn women who came with petitions on no account to give way to tears, if they did not want to ruin their chances.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) will get angry, and will not listen to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they used to say.
<p/>And as a fact, in such cases the emotional disturbance set up in Alexey Alexandrovitch by the sight of tears found expression in hasty anger.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can do nothing.
<p/>Kindly leave the room!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would commonly cry in such cases.
<p/>When returning from the races Anna had informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) relations with Vronsky, and immediately afterwards had burst into tears, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hands, Alexey Alexandrovitch, for all the fury aroused in him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) against her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), was aware at the same time of a rush of that emotional disturbance always produced in him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) by tears.
<p/>Conscious of it, and conscious that any expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) feelings at that minute would be out of keeping with the position, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) tried to suppress every manifestation of life in himself, and so neither stirred nor looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>This was what had caused that strange expression of deathlike rigidity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face which had so impressed Anna.
<p/>When they reached the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to get out of the carriage, and making an effort to master himself, took leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) usual urbanity, and uttered that phrase that bound him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to nothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said that tomorrow he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would let her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) know his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) decision.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife's words, confirming his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) worst suspicions, had sent a cruel pang to the heart of Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>That pang was intensified by the strange feeling of physical pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) set up by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tears.
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was all alone in the carriage Alexey Alexandrovitch, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) surprise and delight, felt complete relief both from this pity and from the doubts and agonies of jealousy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) experienced the sensations of a man who has had a tooth out after suffering long from toothache.
<p/>After a fearful agony and a sense of something huge, bigger than the head itself, being torn out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) jaw, the sufferer, hardly able to believe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own good luck, feels all at once that what has so long poisoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) existence and enchained his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) attention, exists no longer, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) can live and think again, and take interest in other things besides his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) tooth.
<p/>This feeling Alexey Alexandrovitch was experiencing.
<p/>The agony had been strange and terrible, but now it was over; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could live again and think of something other than his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No honor, no heart, no religion; a corrupt woman.
<p/>I always knew it and always saw it, though I tried to deceive myself to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said to himself.
<p/>And it actually seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) always had seen it: he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) recalled incidents of their past life, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had never seen anything wrong before--now these incidents proved clearly that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had always been a corrupt woman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I made a mistake in linking my life to hers; but there was nothing wrong in my mistake, and so I cannot be unhappy.

<p/>The only thing that interested him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) now was the question of in what way he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could best, with most propriety and comfort for himself, and thus with most justice, extricate himself from the mud with which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had spattered him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fall, and then proceed along his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) path of active, honorable, and useful existence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not the first nor the last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) began passing in review the methods of proceeding of men who had been in the same position that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was in.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Daryalov fought a duel...''   (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>The duel had particularly fascinated the thoughts of Alexey Alexandrovitch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) youth, just because he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was physically a coward, and was himself well aware of the fact.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch could not without horror contemplate the idea of a pistol aimed at himself, and had never made use of any weapon in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) life.
<p/>This horror had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) youth set him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) pondering on dueling, and picturing himself in a position in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would have to expose his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) life to danger.
<p/>Having attained success and an established position in the world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had long ago forgotten this feeling; but the habitual bent of feeling reasserted itself, and dread of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own cowardice proved even now so strong that Alexey Alexandrovitch spent a long while thinking over the question of dueling in all its aspects, and hugging the idea of a duel, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was fully aware beforehand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would never under any circumstances fight one.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no doubt our society is still so barbarous -LRB-it's not the same in England-RRB- that very many'' (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>--and among these were those whose opinion Alexey Alexandrovitch particularly valued--<div class="bookquote">``look favorably on the duel; but what result is attained by it?
<p/>Suppose I call him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch went on to himself, and vividly picturing the night he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would spend after the challenge, and the pistol aimed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) shuddered, and knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) never would do it--<div class="bookquote">``suppose I call him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) out.
<p/>Suppose I am taught,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went on musing, <div class="bookquote">``to shoot; I press the trigger,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said to himself, closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``and it turns out I have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head as though to dispel such silly ideas.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What sense is there in murdering a man in order to define one's relation to a guilty wife and son?
<p/>I should still just as much have to decide what I ought to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>But what is more probable and what would doubtless occur--I should be killed or wounded.
<p/>I, the innocent person, should be the victim--killed or wounded.
<p/>It's even more senseless.
<p/>But apart from that, a challenge to fight would be an act hardly honest on my side.
<p/>Don't I know perfectly well that my friends would never allow me to fight a duel--would never allow the life of a statesman, needed by Russia, to be exposed to danger?
<p/>Knowing perfectly well beforehand that the matter would never come to real danger, it would amount to my simply trying to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge.
<p/>That would be dishonest, that would be false, that would be deceiving myself and others.
<p/>A duel is quite irrational, and no one expects it of me.
<p/>My aim is simply to safeguard my reputation, which is essential for the uninterrupted pursuit of my public duties.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Official duties, which had always been of great consequence in Alexey Alexandrovitch's eyes, seemed of special importance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) mind at this moment.
<p/>Considering and rejecting the duel, Alexey Alexandrovitch turned to divorce--another solution selected by several of the husbands he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) remembered.
<p/>Passing in mental review all the instances he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knew of divorces -LRB-there were plenty of them in the very highest society with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was very familiar-RRB-, Alexey Alexandrovitch could not find a single example in which the object of divorce was that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had in view.
<p/>In all these instances the husband had practically ceded or sold his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) unfaithful wife, and the very party which, being in fault, had not the right to contract a fresh marriage, had formed counterfeit, pseudo-matrimonial ties with a self-styled husband.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own case, Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that a legal divorce, that is to say, one in which only the guilty wife would be repudiated, was impossible of attainment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw that the complex conditions of the life they led made the coarse proofs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife's guilt, required by the law, out of the question; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw that a certain refinement in that life would not admit of such proofs being brought forward, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had them, and that to bring forward such proofs would damage him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) in the public estimation more than it would her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>An attempt at divorce could lead to nothing but a public scandal, which would be a perfect godsend to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) enemies for calumny and attacks on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) high position in society.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) chief object, to define the position with the least amount of disturbance possible, would not be attained by divorce either.
<p/>Moreover, in the event of divorce, or even of an attempt to obtain a divorce, it was obvious that the wife broke off all relations with the husband and threw in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lot with the lover.
<p/>And in spite of the complete, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) supposed, contempt and indifference he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) now felt for his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) wife, at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) heart Alexey Alexandrovitch still had one feeling left in regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--a disinclination to see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) free to throw in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lot with Vronsky, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) crime would be to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) advantage.
<p/>The mere notion of this so exasperated Alexey Alexandrovitch, that directly it rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) groaned with inward agony, and got up and changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) place in the carriage, and for a long while after, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sat with scowling brows, wrapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) numbed and bony legs in the fleecy rug.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Apart from formal divorce, One might still do like Karibanov, Paskudin, and that good fellow Dram--that is, separate from one's wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) went on thinking, when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had regained his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) composure.
<p/>But this step too presented the same drawback of public scandal as a divorce, and what was more, a separation, quite as much as a regular divorce, flung his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wife into the arms of Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's out of the question, out of the question!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said again, twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) rug about him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot be unhappy, but neither she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nor he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ought to be happy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The feeling of jealousy, which had tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) during the period of uncertainty, had passed away at the instant when the tooth had been with agony extracted by his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wife's words.
<p/>But that feeling had been replaced by another, the desire, not merely that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should not be triumphant, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should get due punishment for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) crime.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did not acknowledge this feeling, but at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) longed for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to suffer for having destroyed his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) peace of mind--his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) honor.
<p/>And going once again over the conditions inseparable from a duel, a divorce, a separation, and once again rejecting them, Alexey Alexandrovitch felt convinced that there was only one solution,--to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), concealing what had happened from the world, and using every measure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) power to break off the intrigue, and still more--though this he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not admit to himself--to punish her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must inform her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of my conclusion, that thinking over the terrible position in which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has placed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) family, all other solutions will be worse for both sides than an external  status quo , and that such I agree to retain, on the strict condition of obedience on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) part to my wishes, that is to say, cessation of all intercourse with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lover.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>When this decision had been finally adopted, another weighty consideration occurred to Alexey Alexandrovitch in support of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``By such a course only shall I be acting in accordance with the dictates of religion,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) told himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In adopting this course, I am not casting off a guilty wife, but giving her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a chance of amendment; and, indeed, difficult as the task will be to me, I shall devote part of my energies to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reformation and salvation.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Though Alexey Alexandrovitch was perfectly aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not exert any moral influence over his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife, that such an attempt at reformation could lead to nothing but falsity; though in passing through these difficult moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had not once thought of seeking guidance in religion, yet now, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) conclusion corresponded, as it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), with the requirements of religion, this religious sanction to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) decision gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) complete satisfaction, and to some extent restored his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) peace of mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was pleased to think that, even in such an important crisis in life, no one would be able to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had not acted in accordance with the principles of that religion whose banner he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had always held aloft amid the general coolness and indifference.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) pondered over subsequent developments, Alexey Alexandrovitch did not see, indeed, why his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) relations with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife should not remain practically the same as before.
<p/>No doubt, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could never regain his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) esteem, but there was not, and there could not be, any sort of reason that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) existence should be troubled, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) should suffer because she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a bad and faithless wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, time will pass; time, which arranges all things, and the old relations will be reestablished,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself; <div class="bookquote">``so far reestablished, that is, that I shall not be sensible of a break in the continuity of my life.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is bound to be unhappy, but I am not to blame, and so I cannot be unhappy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 14   As he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) neared Petersburg, Alexey Alexandrovitch not only adhered entirely to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) decision, but was even composing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would write to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife.
<p/>Going into the porter's room, Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced at the letters and papers brought from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) office, and directed that they should be brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) study.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The horses can be taken out and I will see no one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said in answer to the porter, with a certain pleasure, indicative of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) agreeable frame of mind, emphasizing the words, <div class="bookquote">``see no one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div><p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) study Alexey Alexandrovitch walked up and down twice, and stopped at an immense writing-table, on which six candles had already been lighted by the valet who had preceded him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) cracked his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) knuckles and sat down, sorting out his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) writing appurtenances.
<p/>Putting his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) elbows on the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) head on one side, thought a minute, and began to write, without pausing for a second.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) wrote without using any form of address to her (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>), and wrote in French, making use of the plural '' vous ,'' which has not the same note of coldness as the corresponding Russian form.
<p/>``At our last conversation, I notified you of my intention to communicate to you my decision in regard to the subject of that conversation.
<p/>Having carefully considered everything, I am writing now with the object of fulfilling that promise.
<p/>My decision is as follows.
<p/>Whatever your conduct may have been, I do not consider myself justified in breaking the ties in which we are bound by a Higher Power.
<p/>The family cannot be broken up by a whim, a caprice, or even by the sin of one of the partners in the marriage, and our life must go on as it has done in the past.
<p/>This is essential for me, for you, and for our son.
<p/>I am fully persuaded that you have repented and do repent of what has called forth the present letter, and that you will cooperate with me in eradicating the cause of our estrangement, and forgetting the past.
<p/>In the contrary event, you can conjecture what awaits you and your son.
<p/>All this I hope to discuss more in detail in a personal interview.
<p/>As the season is drawing to a close, I would beg you to return to Petersburg as quickly as possible, not later than Tuesday.
<p/>All necessary preparations shall be made for your arrival here.
<p/>I beg you to note that I attach particular significance to compliance with this request.
<p/>A. Karenin  <div class="bookquote">``P.S.--I enclose the money which may be needed for your expenses.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) read the letter through and felt pleased with it, and especially that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had remembered to enclose money: there was not a harsh word, not a reproach in it, nor was there undue indulgence.
<p/>Most of all, it was a golden bridge for return.
<p/>Folding the letter and smoothing it with a massive ivory knife, and putting it in an envelope with the money, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) rang the bell with the gratification it always afforded him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to use the well arranged appointments of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) writing-table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give this to the courier to be delivered to Anna Arkadyevna tomorrow at the summer villa,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, getting up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, your excellency; tea to be served in the study?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch ordered tea to be brought to the study, and playing with the massive paper-knife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) moved to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) easy chair, near which there had been placed ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) a lamp and the French work on Egyptian hieroglyphics that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had begun.
<p/>Over the easy chair there hung in a gold frame an oval portrait of Anna, a fine painting by a celebrated artist.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced at it.
<p/>The unfathomable eyes gazed ironically and insolently at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Insufferably insolent and challenging was the effect in Alexey Alexandrovitch's eyes of the black lace about the head, admirably touched in by the painter, the black hair and handsome white hand with one finger lifted, covered with rings.
<p/>After looking at the portrait for a minute, Alexey Alexandrovitch shuddered so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) lips quivered and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) uttered the sound <div class="bookquote">``brrr,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and turned away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) made haste to sit down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) easy chair and opened the book.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) tried to read, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not revive the very vivid interest he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had felt before in Egyptian hieroglyphics.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) looked at the book and thought of something else.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) thought not of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife, but of a complication that had arisen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) official life, which at the time constituted the chief interest of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had penetrated more deeply than ever before into this intricate affair, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had originated a leading idea--he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could say it without self-flattery--calculated to clear up the whole business, to strengthen him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) official career, to discomfit his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) enemies, and thereby to be of the greatest benefit to the government.
<p/>Directly the servant had set the tea and left the room, Alexey Alexandrovitch got up and went to the writing-table.
<p/>Moving into the middle of the table a portfolio of papers, with a scarcely perceptible smile of self-satisfaction, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) took a pencil from a rack and plunged into the perusal of a complex report relating to the present complication.
<p/>The complication was of this nature: Alexey Alexandrovitch's characteristic quality as a politician, that special individual qualification that every rising functionary possesses, the qualification that with his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) unflagging ambition, his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) reserve, his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) honesty, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) self-confidence had made his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) career, was his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) contempt for red tape, his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) cutting down of correspondence, his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) direct contact, wherever possible, with the living fact, and his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) economy.
<p/>It happened that the famous Commission of the 2nd of June had set on foot an inquiry into the irrigation of lands in the Zaraisky province, which fell under Alexey Alexandrovitch's department, and was a glaring example of fruitless expenditure and paper reforms.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch was aware of the truth of this.
<p/>The irrigation of these lands in the Zaraisky province had been initiated by the predecessor of Alexey Alexandrovitch's predecessor.
<p/>And vast sums of money had actually been spent and were still being spent on this business, and utterly unproductively, and the whole business could obviously lead to nothing whatever.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch had perceived this at once on entering office, and would have liked to lay hands on the Board of Irrigation.
<p/>But at first, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not yet feel secure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) position, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knew it would affect too many interests, and would be injudicious.
<p/>Later on he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had been engrossed in other questions, and had simply forgotten the Board of Irrigation.
<p/>It went of itself, like all such boards, by the mere force of inertia.
<p/>-LRB-Many people gained their livelihood by the Board of Irrigation, especially one highly conscientious and musical family: all the daughters played on stringed instruments, and Alexey Alexandrovitch knew the family and had stood godfather to one of the elder daughters.-RRB-
<p/>The raising of this question by a hostile department was in Alexey Alexandrovitch's opinion a dishonorable proceeding, seeing that in every department there were things similar and worse, which no one inquired into, for well-known reasons of official etiquette.
<p/>However, now that the glove had been thrown down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had boldly picked it up and demanded the appointment of a special commission to investigate and verify the working of the Board of Irrigation of the lands in the Zaraisky province.
<p/>But in compensation he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) gave no quarter to the enemy either.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) demanded the appointment of another special commission to inquire into the question of the Native Tribes Organization Committee.
<p/>The question of the Native Tribes had been brought up incidentally in the Commission of the 2nd of June, and had been pressed forward actively by Alexey Alexandrovitch as one admitting of no delay on account of the deplorable condition of the native tribes.
<p/>In the commission this question had been a ground of contention between several departments.
<p/>The department hostile to Alexey Alexandrovitch proved that the condition of the native tribes was exceedingly flourishing, that the proposed reconstruction might be the ruin of their prosperity, and that if there were anything wrong, it arose mainly from the failure on the part of Alexey Alexandrovitch's department to carry out the measures prescribed by law.
<p/>Now Alexey Alexandrovitch intended to demand: First, that a new commission should be formed which should be empowered to investigate the condition of the native tribes on the spot; secondly, if it should appear that the condition of the native tribes actually was such as it appeared to be from the official documents in the hands of the committee, that another new scientific commission should be appointed to investigate the deplorable condition of the native tribes from the---LRB-1-RRB- political, -LRB-2-RRB- administrative, -LRB-3-RRB- economic, -LRB-4-RRB- ethnographical, -LRB-5-RRB- material, and -LRB-6-RRB- religious points of view; thirdly, that evidence should be required from the rival department of the measures that had been taken during the last ten years by that department for averting the disastrous conditions in which the native tribes were now placed; and fourthly and finally, that that department explain why it had, as appeared from the evidence before the committee, from No.
<p/>17,015 and 18,038, from December 5, 1863, and June 7, 1864, acted in direct contravention of the intent of the law T...Act 18, and the note to Act 36.
<p/>A flash of eagerness suffused the face of Alexey Alexandrovitch as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) rapidly wrote out a synopsis of these ideas for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own benefit.
<p/>Having filled a sheet of paper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) got up, rang, and sent a note to the chief secretary of his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) department to look up certain necessary facts for him (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>).
<p/>Getting up and walking about the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) glanced again at the portrait, frowned, and smiled contemptuously.
<p/>After reading a little more of the book on Egyptian hieroglyphics, and renewing his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) interest in it, Alexey Alexandrovitch went to bed at eleven o'clock, and recollecting as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) lay in bed the incident with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw it now in by no means such a gloomy light.
<p/>Chapter 15   Though Anna had obstinately and with exasperation contradicted Vronsky when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) their position was impossible, at the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own position as false and dishonorable, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) longed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) whole soul to change it.
<p/>On the way home from the races she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband the truth in a moment of excitement, and in spite of the agony she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had suffered in doing so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was glad of it.
<p/>After her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) told herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was glad, that now everything was made clear, and at least there would be no more lying and deception.
<p/>It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) beyond doubt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) position was now made clear forever.
<p/>It might be bad, this new position, but it would be clear; there would be no indefiniteness or falsehood about it.
<p/>The pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had caused herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband in uttering those words would be rewarded now by everything being made clear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought.
<p/>That evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw Vronsky, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) of what had passed between her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband, though, to make the position definite, it was necessary to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) woke up next morning the first thing that rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mind was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband, and those words seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) so awful that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not conceive now how she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could have brought herself to utter those strange, coarse words, and could not imagine what would come of it.
<p/>But the words were spoken, and Alexey Alexandrovitch had gone away without saying anything.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw Vronsky and did not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>At the very instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was going away I would have turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) back and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), but I changed my mind, because it was strange that I had not told him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) the first minute.
<p/>Why was it I wanted to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) and did not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And in answer to this question a burning blush of shame spread over her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) knew what had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) from it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had been ashamed.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) position, which had seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) simplified the night before, suddenly struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) now as not only not simple, but as absolutely hopeless.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) felt terrified at the disgrace, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had not ever thought before.
<p/>Directly she (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) thought of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) husband would do, the most terrible ideas came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mind.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had a vision of being turned out of the house, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) shame being proclaimed to all the world.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) asked herself where she (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) should go when she (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was turned out of the house, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) could not find an answer.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) thought of Vronsky, it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was already beginning to be tired of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) could not offer herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) felt bitter against him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for it.
<p/>It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) that the words that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) husband, and had continually repeated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) imagination, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had said to everyone, and everyone had heard them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) could not bring herself to look those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) own household in the face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) could not bring herself to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) maid, and still less go downstairs and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) son and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) governess.
<p/>The maid, who had been listening at her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) door for a long while, came into her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) room of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) own accord.
<p/>Anna glanced inquiringly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face, and blushed with a scared look.
<p/>The maid begged her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) pardon for coming in, saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had fancied the bell rang.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) clothes and a note.
<p/>The note was from Betsy.
<p/>Betsy reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) that Liza Merkalova and Baroness Shtoltz were coming to play croquet with her (<font color='blue'><b>Merkalova</b></font>) that morning with their adorers, Kaluzhsky and old Stremov.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, if only as a study in morals.
<p/>I shall expect you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Merkalova</b></font>) finished.
<p/>Anna read the note and heaved a deep sigh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, I need nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to Annushka, who was rearranging the bottles and brushes on the dressing table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can go.
<p/>I'll dress at once and come down.
<p/>I need nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annushka</b></font>)</div><p/>Annushka went out, but Anna did not begin dressing, and sat in the same position, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head and hands hanging listlessly, and every now and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) shivered all over, seemed as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would make some gesture, utter some word, and sank back into lifelessness again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) repeated continually, <div class="bookquote">``My God!
<p/>my God!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>But neither <div class="bookquote">``God''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>nor <div class="bookquote">``my''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>had any meaning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>The idea of seeking help in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) difficulty in religion was as remote from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as seeking help from Alexey Alexandrovitch himself, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had never had doubts of the faith in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been brought up.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that the support of religion was possible only upon condition of renouncing what made up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) the whole meaning of life.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was not simply miserable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) began to feel alarm at the new spiritual condition, never experienced before, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) found herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt as though everything were beginning to be double in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soul, just as objects sometimes appear double to over-tired eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hardly knew at times what it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) feared, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hoped for.
<p/>Whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) feared or desired what had happened, or what was going to happen, and exactly what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) longed for, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not have said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, what am I doing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to herself, feeling a sudden thrill of pain in both sides of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) came to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hair in both hands, each side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) temples, and pulling it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) jumped up, and began walking about.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The coffee is ready, and mademoiselle and Seryozha are waiting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annushka</b></font>)</div>said Annushka, coming back again and finding Anna in the same position.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seryozha?
<p/>What about Seryozha?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna asked, with sudden eagerness, recollecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son's existence for the first time that morning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s been naughty, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annushka</b></font>)</div>answered Annushka with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some peaches were lying on the table in the corner room.
<p/>I think he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) slipped in and ate one of them on the sly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/>The recollection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son suddenly roused Anna from the helpless condition in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) found herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) recalled the partly sincere, though greatly exaggerated, r√¥le of the mother living for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child, which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had taken up of late years, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt with joy that in the plight in which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) found herself she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had a support, quite apart from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband or to Vronsky.
<p/>This support was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son.
<p/>In whatever position she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might be placed, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not lose her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband might put her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to shame and turn her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) out, Vronsky might grow cold to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and go on living his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own life apart -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) again with bitterness and reproach-RRB-; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had an aim in life.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must act; act to secure this relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might not be taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>Quickly indeed, as quickly as possible, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must take action before he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son and go away.
<p/>Here was the one thing she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had to do now.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) needed consolation.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must be calm, and get out of this insufferable position.
<p/>The thought of immediate action binding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son, of going away somewhere with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), gave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) this consolation.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dressed quickly, went downstairs, and with resolute steps walked into the drawing room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) found, as usual, waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), the coffee, Seryozha, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) governess.
<p/>Seryozha, all in white, with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) back and head bent, was standing at a table under a looking-glass, and with an expression of intense concentration which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew well, and in which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) resembled his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was doing something to the flowers he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) carried.
<p/>The governess had a particularly severe expression.
<p/>Seryozha screamed shrilly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) often did, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, mamma!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>and stopped, hesitating whether to go to greet his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother and put down the flowers, or to finish making the wreath and go with the flowers.
<p/>The governess, after saying good-morning, began a long and detailed account of Seryozha's naughtiness, but Anna did not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was considering whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) or not.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I won't take her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) decided.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go alone with my child.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's very wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son by the shoulder she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), not severely, but with a timid glance that bewildered and delighted the boy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to the astonished governess, and not letting go of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sat down at the table, where coffee was set ready for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma!
<p/>I...I...didn't...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, trying to make out from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) expression what was in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in regard to the peaches.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seryozha,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, as soon as the governess had left the room, <div class="bookquote">``that was wrong, but you'll never do it again, will you?...
<p/>You love me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the governess</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that the tears were coming into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I help loving him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to herself, looking deeply into his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) scared and at the same time delighted eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And can he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ever join his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father in punishing me?
<p/>Is it possible he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will not feel for me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Tears were already flowing down her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face, and to hide them she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) got up abruptly and almost ran out on to the terrace.
<p/>After the thunder showers of the last few days, cold, bright weather had set in.
<p/>The air was cold in the bright sun that filtered through the freshly washed leaves.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) shivered, both from the cold and from the inward horror which had clutched her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with fresh force in the open air.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Run along, run along to Mariette,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to Seryozha, who had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) out, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) began walking up and down on the straw matting of the terrace.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can it be that they won't forgive me, won't understand how it all couldn't be helped?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to herself.
<p/>Standing still, and looking at the tops of the aspen trees waving in the wind, with their freshly washed, brightly shining leaves in the cold sunshine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that they would not forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), that everyone and everything would be merciless to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) now as was that sky, that green.
<p/>And again she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that everything was split in two in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soul.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mustn't, mustn't think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must get ready.
<p/>To go where?
<p/>When?
<p/>Whom to take with me?
<p/>Yes, to Moscow by the evening train.
<p/>Annushka and Seryozha, and only the most necessary things.
<p/>But first I must write to them both.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went quickly indoors into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) boudoir, sat down at the table, and wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband:--<div class="bookquote">``After what has happened, I cannot remain any longer in your house.
<p/>I am going away, and taking my son with me.
<p/>I don't know the law, and so I don't know with which of the parents the son should remain; but I take him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) with me because I cannot live without him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>Be generous, leave him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>Up to this point she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wrote rapidly and naturally, but the appeal to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) generosity, a quality she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not recognize in him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and the necessity of winding up the letter with something touching, pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of my fault and my remorse I cannot speak, because...''   (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stopped again, finding no connection in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ideas.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``there's no need of anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and tearing up the letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wrote it again, leaving out the allusion to generosity, and sealed it up.
<p/>Another letter had to be written to Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have told my husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wrote, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sat a long while unable to write more.
<p/>It was so coarse, so unfeminine.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what more am I to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to herself.
<p/>Again a flush of shame spread over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) recalled his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) composure, and a feeling of anger against him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) impelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to tear the sheet with the phrase she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had written into tiny bits.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No need of anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to herself, and closing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) blotting-case she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went upstairs, told the governess and the servants that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was going that day to Moscow, and at once set to work to pack up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) things.
<p/>Chapter 16   All the rooms of the summer villa were full of porters, gardeners, and footmen going to and fro carrying out things.
<p/>Cupboards and chests were open; twice they had sent to the shop for cord; pieces of newspaper were tossing about on the floor.
<p/>Two trunks, some bags and strapped-up rugs, had been carried down into the hall.
<p/>The carriage and two hired cabs were waiting at the steps.
<p/>Anna, forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) inward agitation in the work of packing, was standing at a table in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) boudoir, packing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) traveling bag, when Annushka called her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) attention to the rattle of some carriage driving up.
<p/>Anna looked out of the window and saw Alexey Alexandrovitch's courier on the steps, ringing at the front door bell.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Run and find out what it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, and with a calm sense of being prepared for anything, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sat down in a low chair, folding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knees.
<p/>A footman brought in a thick packet directed in Alexey Alexandrovitch's hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The courier has orders to wait for an answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) had left the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tore open the letter with trembling fingers.
<p/>A roll of unfolded notes done up in a wrapper fell out of it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) disengaged the letter and began reading it at the end.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Preparations shall be made for your arrival here...I attach particular significance to compliance...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) read.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ran on, then back, read it all through, and once more read the letter all through again from the beginning.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had finished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was cold all over, and that a fearful calamity, such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not expected, had burst upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>In the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had regretted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband, and wished for nothing so much as that those words could be unspoken.
<p/>And here this letter regarded them as unspoken, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had wanted.
<p/>But now this letter seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) more awful than anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been able to conceive.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s right!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s always right; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s a Christian, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s generous!
<p/>Yes, vile, base creature!
<p/>And no one understands it except me, and no one ever will; and I can't explain it.
<p/>They say he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s so religious, so high-principled, so upright, so clever; but they don't see what I've seen.
<p/>They don't know how he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has crushed my life for eight years, crushed everything that was living in me--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has not once even thought that I'm a live woman who must have love.
<p/>They don't know how at every step he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s humiliated me, and been just as pleased with himself.
<p/>Haven't I striven, striven with all my strength, to find something to give meaning to my life?
<p/>Haven't I struggled to love him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), to love my son when I could not love my husband?
<p/>But the time came when I knew that I couldn't cheat myself any longer, that I was alive, that I was not to blame, that God has made me so that I must love and live.
<p/>And now what does he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) do?
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'d killed me, if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'d killed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), I could have borne anything, I could have forgiven anything; but, no, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)....  How was it I didn't guess what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would do?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s doing just what's characteristic of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mean character.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'ll keep himself in the right, while me, in my ruin, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'ll drive still lower to worse ruin yet...''   (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) recalled the words from the letter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can conjecture what awaits you and your son...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's a threat to take away my child, and most likely by their stupid law he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) can.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) doesn't believe even in my love for my child, or he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) despises it -LRB-just as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) always used to ridicule it-RRB-.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) despises that feeling in me, but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) knows that I won't abandon my child, that I can't abandon my child, that there could be no life for me without my child, even with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) whom I love; but that if I abandoned my child and ran away from him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), I should be acting like the most infamous, basest of women.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) knows that, and knows that I am incapable of doing that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) recalled another sentence in the letter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our life must go on as it has done in the past...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``That life was miserable enough in the old days; it has been awful of late.
<p/>What will it be now?
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) knows all that; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) knows that I can't repent that I breathe, that I love; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) knows that it can lead to nothing but lying and deceit; but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wants to go on torturing me.
<p/>I know him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s at home and is happy in deceit, like a fish swimming in the water.
<p/>No, I won't give him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) that happiness.
<p/>I'll break through the spiderweb of lies in which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wants to catch me, come what may.
<p/>Anything's better than lying and deceit.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how?
<p/>My God!
<p/>my God!
<p/>Was ever a woman so miserable as I am?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I will break through it, I will break through it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried, jumping up and keeping back her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tears.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went to the writing table to write him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) another letter.
<p/>But at the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not strong enough to break through anything, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not strong enough to get out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old position, however false and dishonorable it might be.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat down at the writing table, but instead of writing she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands on the table, and, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head on them, burst into tears, with sobs and heaving breast like a child crying.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was weeping that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dream of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) position being made clear and definite had been annihilated forever.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew beforehand that everything would go on in the old way, and far worse, indeed, than in the old way.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt that the position in the world that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) enjoyed, and that had seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) of so little consequence in the morning, that this position was precious to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not have the strength to exchange it for the shameful position of a woman who has abandoned husband and child to join her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lover; that however much she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might struggle, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not be stronger than herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would never know freedom in love, but would remain forever a guilty wife, with the menace of detection hanging over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at every instant; deceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband for the sake of a shameful connection with a man living apart and away from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), whose life she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could never share.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew that this was how it would be, and at the same time it was so awful that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not even conceive what it would end in.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried without restraint, as children cry when they are punished.
<p/>The sound of the footman's steps forced her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to rouse herself, and, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face from him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pretended to be writing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The courier asks if there's an answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>the footman</b></font>)</div>the footman announced.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An answer?
<p/>Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) wait.
<p/>I'll ring.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can I write?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can I decide upon alone?
<p/>What do I know?
<p/>What do I want?
<p/>What is there I care for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soul was beginning to be split in two.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was terrified again at this feeling, and clutched at the first pretext for doing something which might divert her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thoughts from herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to see Alexey''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-so she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) called Vronsky in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thoughts-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``no one but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) can tell me what I ought to do.
<p/>I'll go to Betsy's, perhaps I shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) said to herself, completely forgetting that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) the day before that she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) was not going to Princess Tverskaya's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) had said that in that case he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) should not go either.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) went up to the table, wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``I have received your letter.
<p/>--A.
<p/>'' (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>; and, ringing the bell, gave it to the footman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not going,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) said to Annushka, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) came in.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not going at all?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; don't unpack till tomorrow, and let the carriage wait.
<p/>I'm going to the princess's.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which dress am I to get ready?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chapter The croquet party</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 17   The croquet party to which the Princess Tverskaya had invited Anna was to consist of two ladies and their adorers.
<p/>These two ladies were the chief representatives of a select new Petersburg circle, nicknamed, in imitation of some imitation,  les sept merveilles du monde .
<p/>These ladies belonged to a circle which, though of the highest society, was utterly hostile to that in which Anna moved.
<p/>Moreover, Stremov, one of the most influential people in Petersburg, and the elderly admirer of Liza Merkalova, was Alexey Alexandrovitch's enemy in the political world.
<p/>From all these considerations Anna had not meant to go, and the hints in Princess Tverskaya's note referred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) refusal.
<p/>But now Anna was eager to go, in the hope of seeing Vronsky.
<p/>Anna arrived at Princess Tverskaya's earlier than the other guests.
<p/>At the same moment as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) entered, Vronsky's footman, with side-whiskers combed out like a  Kammerjunker , went in too.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) stopped at the door, and, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) cap, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pass.
<p/>Anna recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>), and only then recalled that Vronsky had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) the day before that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) would not come.
<p/>Most likely he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was sending a note to say so.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) outer garment in the hall, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heard the footman, pronouncing his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``r's''  (<font color='red'><b>the footman</b></font>)</div>even like a  Kammerjunker , say, <div class="bookquote">``From the count for the princess,''  (<font color='red'><b>the footman</b></font>)</div>and hand the note.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) longed to question him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) as to where his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) master was.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) longed to turn back and send him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) a letter to come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), or to go herself to see him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>).
<p/>But neither the first nor the second nor the third course was possible.
<p/>Already she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) heard bells ringing to announce her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) arrival ahead of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), and Princess Tverskaya's footman was standing at the open door waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) to go forward into the inner rooms.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The princess is in the garden; they will inform her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) immediately.
<p/>Would you be pleased to walk into the garden?''
 (<font color='red'><b>another footman</b></font>)</div><p/>announced another footman in another room.
<p/>The position of uncertainty, of indecision, was still the same as at home--worse, in fact, since it was impossible to take any step, impossible to see Vronsky, and she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had to remain here among outsiders, in company so uncongenial to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) present mood.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was wearing a dress that she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) knew suited her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was not alone; all around was that luxurious setting of idleness that she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was used to, and she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) felt less wretched than at home.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was not forced to think what she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was to do.
<p/>Everything would be done of itself.
<p/>On meeting Betsy coming towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) in a white gown that struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) by its elegance, Anna smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) always did.
<p/>Princess Tverskaya was walking with Tushkevitch and a young lady, a relation, who, to the great joy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) parents in the provinces, was spending the summer with the fashionable princess.
<p/>There was probably something unusual about Anna, for Betsy noticed it at once.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I slept badly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>answered Anna, looking intently at the footman who came to meet them, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) supposed, brought Vronsky's note.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How glad I am you've come!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Betsy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm tired, and was just longing to have some tea before they come.
<p/>You might go'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-- she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) turned to Tushkevitch--<div class="bookquote">``with Masha, and try the croquet ground over there where they've been cutting it.
<p/>We shall have time to talk a little over tea; we'll have a cozy chat, eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tushkevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) said in English to Anna, with a smile, pressing the hand with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) held a parasol.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, especially as I can't stay very long with you.
<p/>I'm forced to go on to old Madame Vrede.
<p/>I've been promising to go for a century,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, to whom lying, alien as it was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) nature, had become not merely simple and natural in society, but a positive source of satisfaction.
<p/>Why she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said this, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not thought of a second before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not have explained.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had said it simply from the reflection that as Vronsky would not be here, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had better secure her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own freedom, and try to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Vrede</b></font>) somehow.
<p/>But why she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had spoken of old Madame Vrede, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had to go and see, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had to see many other people, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not have explained; and yet, as it afterwards turned out, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) contrived the most cunning devices to meet Vronsky, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could have thought of nothing better.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.
<p/>I'm not going to let you go for anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>answered Betsy, looking intently into Anna's face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, if I were not fond of you, I should feel offended.
<p/>One would think you were afraid my society would compromise you.
<p/>Tea in the little dining room, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, half closing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) always did when addressing the footman.
<p/>Taking the note from him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) read it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexey's playing us false,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said in French; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) writes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) can't come,''  (<font color='red'><b>French</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) added in a tone as simple and natural as though it could never enter her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head that Vronsky could mean anything more to Anna than a game of croquet.
<p/>Anna knew that Betsy knew everything, but, hearing how she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) spoke of Vronsky before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) almost felt persuaded for a minute that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew nothing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna indifferently, as though not greatly interested in the matter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went on smiling: <div class="bookquote">``How can you or your friends compromise anyone?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This playing with words, this hiding of a secret, had a great fascination for Anna, as, indeed, it has for all women.
<p/>And it was not the necessity of concealment, not the aim with which the concealment was contrived, but the process of concealment itself which attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't be more Catholic than the Pope,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stremov and Liza Merkalova, why, they're the cream of the cream of society.
<p/>Besides, they're received everywhere, and  I '' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Merkalova</b></font>) laid special stress on the I--<div class="bookquote">``have never been strict and intolerant.
<p/>It's simply that I haven't the time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; you don't care, perhaps, to meet Stremov?
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) and Alexey Alexandrovitch tilt at each other in the committee-- that's no affair of ours.
<p/>But in the world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)'s the most amiable man I know, and a devoted croquet player.
<p/>You shall see.
<p/>And, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) absurd position as Liza's lovesick swain at his (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) age, you ought to see how he (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) carries off the absurd position.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>)'s very nice.
<p/>Sappho Shtoltz you don't know?
<p/>Oh, that's a new type, quite new.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Betsy said all this, and, at the same time, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) good-humored, shrewd glance, Anna felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) partly guessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) plight, and was hatching something for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) benefit.
<p/>They were in the little boudoir.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must write to Alexey though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>and Betsy sat down to the table, scribbled a few lines, and put the note in an envelope.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) to come to dinner.
<p/>I've one lady extra to dinner with me, and no man to take her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in.

<p/>Excuse me, I must leave you for a minute.
<p/>Would you seal it up, please, and send it off?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said from the door; <div class="bookquote">``I have to give some directions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Without a moment's thought, Anna sat down to the table with Betsy's letter, and, without reading it, wrote below: <div class="bookquote">``It's essential for me to see you.
<p/>Come to the Vrede garden.
<p/>I shall be there at six o'clock.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sealed it up, and, Betsy coming back, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) presence handed the note to be taken.
<p/>At tea, which was brought them on a little tea-table in the cool little drawing room, the cozy chat promised by Princess Tverskaya before the arrival of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) visitors really did come off between the two women.
<p/>They criticized the people they were expecting, and the conversation fell upon Liza Merkalova.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Merkalova</b></font>)'s very sweet, and I always liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Merkalova</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to like her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) says you're a real heroine of romance, and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) were a man she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would do all sorts of mad things for your sake.

<p/>What does it mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Betsy smiled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) eyes, and looked intently at Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a new manner,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They've all adopted that manner.

 (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Betsy broke into unexpectedly mirthful and irrepressible laughter, a thing which rarely happened with her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're encroaching on Princess Myakaya's special domain now.
<p/>That's the question of an  enfant terrible ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>and Betsy obviously tried to restrain herself, but could not, and went off into peals of that infectious laughter that people laugh who do not laugh often.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better ask them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) brought out, between tears of laughter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; you laugh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, laughing too in spite of herself, <div class="bookquote">``but I never could understand it.

<p/>Putting a cup before Anna, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) took out a cigarette, and, fitting it into a silver holder, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lighted it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's like this, you see: I'm in a fortunate position,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) began, quite serious now, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cup.

<p/>The very same thing, don't you see, may be looked at tragically, and turned into a misery, or it may be looked at simply and even humorously.
<p/>Possibly you are inclined to look at things too tragically.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How I should like to know other people just as I know myself!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna, seriously and dreamily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I worse than other people, or better?
<p/>I think I'm worse.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Enfant terrible, enfant terrible! ''
<p/>repeated Betsy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But here they are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 18   They heard the sound of steps and a man's voice, then a woman's voice and laughter, and immediately thereafter there walked in the expected guests: Sappho Shtoltz, and a young man beaming with excess of health, the so-called Vaska.
<p/>It was evident that ample supplies of beefsteak, truffles, and Burgundy never failed to reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) at the fitting hour.
<p/>Vaska bowed to the two ladies, and glanced at them, but only for one second.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) walked after Sappho into the drawing-room, and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) about as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) were chained to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) sparkling eyes fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) wanted to eat her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Sappho Shtoltz was a blonde beauty with black eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) walked with smart little steps in high-heeled shoes, and shook hands with the ladies vigorously like a man.
<p/>Anna had never met this new star of fashion, and was struck by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) beauty, the exaggerated extreme to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dress was carried, and the boldness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) manners.
<p/>On her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head there was such a superstructure of soft, golden hair--her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own and false mixed--that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head was equal in size to the elegantly rounded bust, of which so much was exposed in front.
<p/>The impulsive abruptness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) movements was such that at every step the lines of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knees and the upper part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) legs were distinctly marked under her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dress, and the question involuntarily rose to the mind where in the undulating, piled-up mountain of material at the back the real body of the woman, so small and slender, so naked in front, and so hidden behind and below, really came to an end.
<p/>Betsy made haste to introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) to Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only fancy, we all but ran over two soldiers,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) began telling them at once, using her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes, smiling and twitching away her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tail, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) flung back at one stroke all on one side.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I drove here with Vaska....  Ah, to be sure, you don't know each other.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And mentioning his (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) surname she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) introduced the young man, and reddening a little, broke into a ringing laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mistake--that is, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) having called him (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) Vaska to a stranger.
<p/>Vaska bowed once more to Anna, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) said nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) addressed Sappho: <div class="bookquote">``You've lost your bet.
<p/>We got here first.
<p/>Pay up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sappho/Sappho Shtoltz</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>), smiling.
<p/>Sappho laughed still more festively.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, all right, I'll have it later.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, very well.
<p/>Oh, yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) turned suddenly to Princess Betsy: <div class="bookquote">``I am a nice person...I positively forgot it...
<p/>I've brought you a visitor.
<p/>And here he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) comes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>The unexpected young visitor, whom Sappho had invited, and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) had forgotten, was, however, a personage of such consequence that, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) youth, both the ladies rose on his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) entrance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was a new admirer of Sappho's.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) now dogged her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) footsteps, like Vaska.
<p/>Soon after Prince Kaluzhsky arrived, and Liza Merkalova with Stremov.
<p/>Liza Merkalova was a thin brunette, with an Oriental, languid type of face, and--as everyone used to say--exquisite enigmatic eyes.
<p/>The tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Merkalova</b></font>) dark dress -LRB-Anna immediately observed and appreciated the fact-RRB- was in perfect harmony with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) style of beauty.
<p/>Liza was as soft and enervated as Sappho was smart and abrupt.
<p/>But to Anna's taste Liza was far more attractive.
<p/>Betsy had said to Anna that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had adopted the pose of an innocent child, but when Anna saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that this was not the truth.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) really was both innocent and corrupt, but a sweet and passive woman.
<p/>It is true that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tone was the same as Sappho's; that like Sappho, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had two men, one young and one old, tacked onto her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and devouring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with their eyes.
<p/>But there was something in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) higher than what surrounded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>There was in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the glow of the real diamond among glass imitations.
<p/>This glow shone out in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exquisite, truly enigmatic eyes.
<p/>The weary, and at the same time passionate, glance of those eyes, encircled by dark rings, impressed one by its perfect sincerity.
<p/>Everyone looking into those eyes fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wholly, and knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), could not but love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>At the sight of Anna, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) whole face lighted up at once with a smile of delight.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, how glad I am to see you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, going up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yesterday at the races all I wanted was to get to you, but you'd gone away.
<p/>I did so want to see you, yesterday especially.
<p/>Wasn't it awful?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, looking at Anna with eyes that seemed to lay bare all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soul.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I had no idea it would be so thrilling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, blushing.
<p/>The company got up at this moment to go into the garden.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Liza Merkalova/Liza</b></font>)</div>said Liza, smiling and settling herself close to Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't go either, will you?
<p/>Who wants to play croquet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, how do you manage never to be bored by things?
<p/>It's delightful to look at you.
<p/>You're alive, but I'm bored.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you be bored?
<p/>Why, you live in the liveliest set in Petersburg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly the people who are not of our set are even more bored; but we--I certainly--are not happy, but awfully, awfully bored.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sappho/Sappho Shtoltz</b></font>)</div><p/>Sappho smoking a cigarette went off into the garden with the two young men.
<p/>Betsy and Stremov remained at the tea-table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, bored!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Betsy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sappho says they did enjoy themselves tremendously at your house last night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, how dreary it all was!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Liza Merkalova/Liza</b></font>)</div><p/>said Liza Merkalova.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We all drove back to my place after the races.
<p/>And always the same people, always the same.
<p/>Always the same thing.
<p/>We lounged about on sofas all the evening.
<p/>What is there to enjoy in that?
<p/>No; do tell me how you manage never to be bored?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Merkalova</b></font>) said, addressing Anna again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One has but to look at you and one sees, here's a woman who may be happy or unhappy, but isn't bored.
<p/>Tell me how you do it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>answered Anna, blushing at these searching questions.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the best way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stremov</b></font>)</div>Stremov put in.
<p/>Stremov was a man of fifty, partly gray, but still vigorous-looking, very ugly, but with a characteristic and intelligent face.
<p/>Liza Merkalova was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife's niece, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spent all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leisure hours with her (<font color='blue'><b>Merkalova</b></font>).
<p/>On meeting Anna Karenina, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was Alexey Alexandrovitch's enemy in the government, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried, like a shrewd man and a man of the world, to be particularly cordial with her (<font color='blue'><b>Karenina</b></font>), the wife of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enemy.
<p/>''`Nothing,''' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put in with a subtle smile, <div class="bookquote">``that's the very best way.
<p/>I told you long ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, turning to Liza Merkalova, <div class="bookquote">``that if you don't want to be bored, you mustn't think you're going to be bored.
<p/>It's just as you mustn't be afraid of not being able to fall asleep, if you're afraid of sleeplessness.
<p/>That's just what Anna Arkadyevna has just said.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Liza Merkalova/Liza</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be very glad if I had said it, for it's not only clever but true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, do tell me why it is one can't go to sleep, and one can't help being bored?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To sleep well one ought to work, and to enjoy oneself one ought to work too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to work for when my work is no use to anybody?
<p/>And I can't and won't knowingly make a pretense about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're incorrigible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stremov</b></font>)</div>said Stremov, not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) spoke again to Anna.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) rarely met Anna, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could say nothing but commonplaces to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said those commonplaces as to when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was returning to Petersburg, and how fond Countess Lidia Ivanovna was of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), with an expression which suggested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) longed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) whole soul to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) and show his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) and even more than that.
<p/>Tushkevitch came in, announcing that the party were awaiting the other players to begin croquet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, don't go away, please don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Liza Merkalova/Liza</b></font>)</div>pleaded Liza Merkalova, hearing that Anna was going.
<p/>Stremov joined in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) entreaties.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's too violent a transition,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to go from such company to old Madame Vrede.
<p/>And besides, you will only give her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) a chance for talking scandal, while here you arouse none but such different feelings of the highest and most opposite kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Anna pondered for an instant in uncertainty.
<p/>This shrewd man's flattering words, the na√Øve, childlike affection shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) by Liza Merkalova, and all the social atmosphere she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was used to,-- it was all so easy, and what was in store for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was so difficult, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was for a minute in uncertainty whether to remain, whether to put off a little longer the painful moment of explanation.
<p/>But remembering what was in store for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) alone at home, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not come to some decision, remembering that gesture--terrible even in memory--when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had clutched her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hair in both hands--she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said good-bye and went away.
<p/>Chapter 19   In spite of Vronsky's apparently frivolous life in society, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was a man who hated irregularity.
<p/>In early youth in the Corps of Pages, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had experienced the humiliation of a refusal, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had tried, being in difficulties, to borrow money, and since then he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had never once put himself in the same position again.
<p/>In order to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) affairs in some sort of order, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) used about five times a year -LRB-more or less frequently, according to circumstances-RRB- to shut himself up alone and put all his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) affairs into definite shape.
<p/>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) used to call his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) day of reckoning or  faire la lessive .
<p/>On waking up the day after the races, Vronsky put on a white linen coat, and without shaving or taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bath, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) distributed about the table moneys, bills, and letters, and set to work.
<p/>Petritsky, who knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was ill-tempered on such occasions, on waking up and seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) comrade at the writing-table, quietly dressed and went out without getting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) way.
<p/>Every man who knows to the minutest details all the complexity of the conditions surrounding him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), cannot help imagining that the complexity of these conditions, and the difficulty of making them clear, is something exceptional and personal, peculiar to himself, and never supposes that others are surrounded by just as complicated an array of personal affairs as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is.
<p/>So indeed it seemed to Vronsky.
<p/>And not without inward pride, and not without reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought that any other man would long ago have been in difficulties, would have been forced to some dishonorable course, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had found himself in such a difficult position.
<p/>But Vronsky felt that now especially it was essential for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) to clear up and define his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) position if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) were to avoid getting into difficulties.
<p/>What Vronsky attacked first as being the easiest was his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) pecuniary position.
<p/>Writing out on note paper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) minute hand all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) owed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) added up the amount and found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) debts amounted to seventeen thousand and some odd hundreds, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) left out for the sake of clearness.
<p/>Reckoning up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) money and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) bank book, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had left one thousand eight hundred roubles, and nothing coming in before the New Year.
<p/>Reckoning over again his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) list of debts, Vronsky copied it, dividing it into three classes.
<p/>In the first class he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) put the debts which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) would have to pay at once, or for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) must in any case have the money ready so that on demand for payment there could not be a moment's delay in paying.
<p/>Such debts amounted to about four thousand: one thousand five hundred for a horse, and two thousand five hundred as surety for a young comrade, Venovsky, who had lost that sum to a cardsharper in Vronsky's presence.
<p/>Vronsky had wanted to pay the money at the time -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) had that amount then-RRB-, but Venovsky and Yashvin had insisted that they would pay and not Vronsky, who had not played.
<p/>That was so far well, but Vronsky knew that in this dirty business, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) only share in it was undertaking by word of mouth to be surety for Venovsky, it was absolutely necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) to have the two thousand five hundred roubles so as to be able to fling it at the swindler, and have no more words with him (<font color='blue'><b>swindler</b></font>).
<p/>And so for this first and most important division he (<font color='blue'><b>swindler</b></font>) must have four thousand roubles.
<p/>The second class--eight thousand roubles--consisted of less important debts.
<p/>These were principally accounts owing in connection with his (<font color='blue'><b>swindler</b></font>) race horses, to the purveyor of oats and hay, the English saddler, and so on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>saddler</b></font>) would have to pay some two thousand roubles on these debts too, in order to be quite free from anxiety.
<p/>The last class of debts--to shops, to hotels, to his (<font color='blue'><b>saddler</b></font>) tailor--were such as need not be considered.
<p/>So that he (<font color='blue'><b>saddler</b></font>) needed at least six thousand roubles for current expenses, and he (<font color='blue'><b>saddler</b></font>) only had one thousand eight hundred.
<p/>For a man with one hundred thousand roubles of revenue, which was what everyone fixed as Vronsky's income, such debts, one would suppose, could hardly be embarrassing; but the fact was that he (<font color='blue'><b>saddler</b></font>) was far from having one hundred thousand.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>saddler</b></font>) father's immense property, which alone yielded a yearly income of two hundred thousand, was left undivided between the brothers.
<p/>At the time when the elder brother, with a mass of debts, married Princess Varya Tchirkova, the daughter of a Decembrist without any fortune whatever, Alexey had given up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) elder brother almost the whole income from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) father's estate, reserving for himself only twenty-five thousand a year from it.
<p/>Alexey had said at the time to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) brother that that sum would be sufficient for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) married, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) probably never would do.
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) brother, who was in command of one of the most expensive regiments, and was only just married, could not decline the gift.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) mother, who had her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own separate property, had allowed Alexey every year twenty thousand in addition to the twenty-five thousand he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) had reserved, and Alexey had spent it all.
<p/>Of late his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) mother, incensed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) love affair and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) leaving Moscow, had given up sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) the money.
<p/>And in consequence of this, Vronsky, who had been in the habit of living on the scale of forty-five thousand a year, having only received twenty thousand that year, found himself now in difficulties.
<p/>To get out of these difficulties, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) could not apply to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) mother for money.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) last letter, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) had received the day before, had particularly exasperated him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) by the hints in it that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was quite ready to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) to succeed in the world and in the army, but not to lead a life which was a scandal to all good society.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) mother's attempt to buy him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) stung him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) to the quick and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) feel colder than ever to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) could not draw back from the generous word when it was once uttered, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) felt now, vaguely foreseeing certain eventualities in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) intrigue with Madame Karenina, that this generous word had been spoken thoughtlessly, and that even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) were not married he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) might need all the hundred thousand of income.
<p/>But it was impossible to draw back.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) had only to recall his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) brother's wife, to remember how that sweet, delightful Varya sought, at every convenient opportunity, to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) generosity and appreciated it, to grasp the impossibility of taking back his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) gift.
<p/>It was as impossible as beating a woman, stealing, or lying.
<p/>One thing only could and ought to be done, and Vronsky determined upon it without an instant's hesitation: to borrow money from a money-lender, ten thousand roubles, a proceeding which presented no difficulty, to cut down his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) expenses generally, and to sell his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) race horses.
<p/>Resolving on this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) promptly wrote a note to Rolandak, who had more than once sent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) with offers to buy horses from him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>).
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) sent for the Englishman and the money-lender, and divided what money he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) had according to the accounts he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) intended to pay.
<p/>Having finished this business, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) wrote a cold and cutting answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) mother.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) took out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) notebook three notes of Anna's, read them again, burned them, and remembering their conversation on the previous day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) sank into meditation.
<p/>Chapter 20   Vronsky's life was particularly happy in that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) had a code of principles, which defined with unfailing certitude what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) ought and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) ought not to do.
<p/>This code of principles covered only a very small circle of contingencies, but then the principles were never doubtful, and Vronsky, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) never went outside that circle, had never had a moment's hesitation about doing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) ought to do.
<p/>These principles laid down as invariable rules: that one must pay a cardsharper, but need not pay a tailor; that one must never tell a lie to a man, but one may to a woman; that one must never cheat anyone, but one may a husband; that one must never pardon an insult, but one may give one and so on.
<p/>These principles were possibly not reasonable and not good, but they were of unfailing certainty, and so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) adhered to them, Vronsky felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) heart was at peace and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) could hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) head up.
<p/>Only quite lately in regard to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) relations with Anna, Vronsky had begun to feel that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) code of principles did not fully cover all possible contingencies, and to foresee in the future difficulties and perplexities for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) could find no guiding clue.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) present relation to Anna and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband was to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mind clear and simple.
<p/>It was clearly and precisely defined in the code of principles by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was guided.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was an honorable woman who had bestowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) love upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) eyes a woman who had a right to the same, or even more, respect than a lawful wife.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) would have had his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) hand chopped off before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) would have allowed himself by a word, by a hint, to humiliate her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), or even to fall short of the fullest respect a woman could look for.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) attitude to society, too, was clear.
<p/>Everyone might know, might suspect it, but no one might dare to speak of it.
<p/>If any did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was ready to force all who might speak to be silent and to respect the non-existent honor of the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) loved.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) attitude to the husband was the clearest of all.
<p/>From the moment that Anna loved Vronsky, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) own right over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as the one thing unassailable.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband was simply a superfluous and tiresome person.
<p/>No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was in a pitiable position, but how could that be helped?
<p/>The one thing the husband had a right to was to demand satisfaction with a weapon in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hand, and Vronsky was prepared for this at any minute.
<p/>But of late new inner relations had arisen between him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), which frightened Vronsky by their indefiniteness.
<p/>Only the day before she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was with child.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) felt that this fact and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) called for something not fully defined in that code of principles by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had hitherto steered his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) course in life.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had been indeed caught unawares, and at the first moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) position, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) heart had prompted him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) to beg her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had said that, but now thinking things over he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) saw clearly that it would be better to manage to avoid that; and at the same time, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) told himself so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was afraid whether it was not wrong.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband, that must mean uniting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) life with mine; am I prepared for that?
<p/>How can I take her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) away now, when I have no money?
<p/>Supposing I could arrange....
<p/>But how can I take her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) away while I'm in the service?
<p/>If I say that--I ought to be prepared to do it, that is, I ought to have the money and to retire from the army.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) grew thoughtful.
<p/>The question whether to retire from the service or not brought him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to the other and perhaps the chief though hidden interest of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) life, of which none knew but he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>).
<p/>Ambition was the old dream of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) youth and childhood, a dream which he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) did not confess even to himself, though it was so strong that now this passion was even doing battle with his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) love.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) first steps in the world and in the service had been successful, but two years before he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) had made a great mistake.
<p/>Anxious to show his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) independence and to advance, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) had refused a post that had been offered him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>), hoping that this refusal would heighten his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) value; but it turned out that he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) had been too bold, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was passed over.
<p/>And having, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) liked or not, taken up for himself the position of an independent man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carried it off with great tact and good sense, behaving as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bore no grudge against anyone, did not regard himself as injured in any way, and cared for nothing but to be left alone since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was enjoying himself.
<p/>In reality he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ceased to enjoy himself as long ago as the year before, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went away to Moscow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that this independent attitude of a man who might have done anything, but cared to do nothing, was already beginning to pall, that many people were beginning to fancy that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not really capable of anything but being a straightforward, good-natured fellow.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) connection with Madame Karenina, by creating so much sensation and attracting general attention, had given him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) a fresh distinction which soothed his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) gnawing worm of ambition for a while, but a week before that worm had been roused up again with fresh force.
<p/>The friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) childhood, a man of the same set, of the same coterie, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) comrade in the Corps of Pages, Serpuhovskoy, who had left school with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) and had been his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) rival in class, in gymnastics, in their scrapes and their dreams of glory, had come back a few days before from Central Asia, where he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had gained two steps up in rank, and an order rarely bestowed upon generals so young.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) arrived in Petersburg, people began to talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as a newly risen star of the first magnitude.
<p/>A schoolfellow of Vronsky's and of the same age, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was a general and was expecting a command, which might have influence on the course of political events; while Vronsky, independent and brilliant and beloved by a charming woman though he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was, was simply a cavalry captain who was readily allowed to be as independent as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) liked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I don't envy Serpuhovskoy and never could envy him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>); but his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) advancement shows me that one has only to watch one's opportunity, and the career of a man like me may be very rapidly made.
<p/>Three years ago he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in just the same position as I am.
<p/>If I retire, I burn my ships.
<p/>If I remain in the army, I lose nothing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said herself she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not wish to change her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) position.
<p/>And with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) love I cannot feel envious of Serpuhovskoy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And slowly twirling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mustaches, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up from the table and walked about the room.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes shone particularly brightly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt in that confident, calm, and happy frame of mind which always came after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had thoroughly faced his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position.
<p/>Everything was straight and clear, just as after former days of reckoning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shaved, took a cold bath, dressed and went out.
<p/>Chapter 21   <div class="bookquote">``We've come to fetch you.
<p/>Your  lessive  lasted a good time today,''  (<font color='red'><b>Petritsky</b></font>)</div>said Petritsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, is it over?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>answered Vronsky, smiling with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes only, and twirling the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mustaches as circumspectly as though after the perfect order into which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affairs had been brought any over-bold or rapid movement might disturb it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're always just as if you'd come out of a bath after it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Petritsky</b></font>)</div>said Petritsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come from Gritsky's''  (<font color='red'><b>the colonel</b></font>)</div>-LRB-that was what they called the colonel-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``they're expecting you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky, without answering, looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) comrade, thinking of something else.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; is that music at his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) place?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) said, listening to the familiar sounds of polkas and waltzes floating across to him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the f√™te?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Serpuhovskoy's come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vronsky, <div class="bookquote">``why, I didn't know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>The smile in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) eyes gleamed more brightly than ever.
<p/>Having once made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was happy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) love, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) sacrificed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) ambition to it--having anyway taken up this position, Vronsky was incapable of feeling either envious of Serpuhovskoy or hurt with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) for not coming first to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) came to the regiment.
<p/>Serpuhovskoy was a good friend, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was delighted he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had come.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I'm very glad!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The colonel Demin</b></font>)</div><p/>The colonel, Demin, had taken a large country house.
<p/>The whole party were in the wide lower balcony.
<p/>In the courtyard the first objects that met Vronsky's eyes were a band of singers in white linen coats, standing near a barrel of vodka, and the robust, good-humored figure of the colonel surrounded by officers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) had gone out as far as the first step of the balcony and was loudly shouting across the band that played Offenbach's quadrille, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) arms and giving some orders to a few soldiers standing on one side.
<p/>A group of soldiers, a quartermaster, and several subalterns came up to the balcony with Vronsky.
<p/>The colonel returned to the table, went out again onto the steps with a tumbler in his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) hand, and proposed the toast, <div class="bookquote">``To the health of our former comrade, the gallant general, Prince Serpuhovskoy.
<p/>Hurrah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The colonel was followed by Serpuhovskoy, who came out onto the steps smiling, with a glass in his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You always get younger, Bondarenko,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) said to the rosy-checked, smart-looking quartermaster standing just before him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>), still youngish looking though doing his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) second term of service.
<p/>It was three years since Vronsky had seen Serpuhovskoy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) looked more robust, had let his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) whiskers grow, but was still the same graceful creature, whose face and figure were even more striking from their softness and nobility than their beauty.
<p/>The only change Vronsky detected in him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) was that subdued, continual radiance of beaming content which settles on the faces of men who are successful and are sure of the recognition of their success by everyone.
<p/>Vronsky knew that radiant air, and immediately observed it in Serpuhovskoy.
<p/>As Serpuhovskoy came down the steps he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) saw Vronsky.
<p/>A smile of pleasure lighted up his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) head upwards and waved the glass in his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) hand, greeting Vronsky, and showing him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) by the gesture that he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) could not come to him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) before the quartermaster, who stood craning forward his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) lips ready to be kissed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>shouted the colonel.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yashvin told me you were in one of your gloomy tempers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>)</div><p/>Serpuhovskoy kissed the moist, fresh lips of the gallant-looking quartermaster, and wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) mouth with his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) handkerchief, went up to Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How glad I am!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) said, squeezing his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) hand and drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) on one side.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look after him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the colonel</b></font>)</div>the colonel shouted to Yashvin, pointing to Vronsky; and he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) went down below to the soldiers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why weren't you at the races yesterday?
<p/>I expected to see you there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, scrutinizing Serpuhovskoy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did go, but late.
<p/>I beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) added, and he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) turned to the adjutant: <div class="bookquote">``Please have this divided from me, each man as much as it runs to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the adjutant</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hurriedly took notes for three hundred roubles from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocketbook, blushing a little.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vronsky!
<p/>Have anything to eat or drink?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Yashvin/Prince Yashvin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Yashvin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hi, something for the count to eat!
<p/>Ah, here it is: have a glass!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The f√™te at the colonel's lasted a long while.
<p/>There was a great deal of drinking.
<p/>They tossed Serpuhovskoy in the air and caught him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) again several times.
<p/>Then they did the same to the colonel.
<p/>Then, to the accompaniment of the band, the colonel himself danced with Petritsky.
<p/>Then the colonel, who began to show signs of feebleness, sat down on a bench in the courtyard and began demonstrating to Yashvin the superiority of Russia over Poland, especially in cavalry attack, and there was a lull in the revelry for a moment.
<p/>Serpuhovskoy went into the house to the bathroom to wash his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) hands and found Vronsky there; Vronsky was drenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) head with water.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had taken off his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) coat and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) sunburnt, hairy neck under the tap, and was rubbing it and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) head with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) hands.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had finished, Vronsky sat down by Serpuhovskoy.
<p/>They both sat down in the bathroom on a lounge, and a conversation began which was very interesting to both of them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've always been hearing about you through my wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>)</div>said Serpuhovskoy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you've been seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pretty often.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s friendly with Varya, and they're the only women in Petersburg I care about seeing,''  (<font color='red'><b>women Vronsky</b></font>)</div>answered Vronsky, smiling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) smiled because he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) foresaw the topic the conversation would turn on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was glad of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The only ones?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>)</div><p/>Serpuhovskoy queried, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and I heard news of you, but not only through your wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, checking his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) hint by a stern expression of face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was greatly delighted to hear of your success, but not a bit surprised.
<p/>I expected even more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>)</div><p/>Serpuhovskoy smiled.
<p/>Such an opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was obviously agreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) did not think it necessary to conceal it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I on the contrary expected less--I'll own frankly.
<p/>But I'm glad, very glad.
<p/>I'm ambitious; that's my weakness, and I confess to it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you wouldn't confess to it if you hadn't been successful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>)</div>said Serpuhovskoy, smiling again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't say life wouldn't be worth living without it, but it would be dull.
<p/>Of course I may be mistaken, but I fancy I have a certain capacity for the line I've chosen, and that power of any sort in my hands, if it is to be, will be better than in the hands of a good many people I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>)</div>said Serpuhovskoy, with beaming consciousness of success; <div class="bookquote">``and so the nearer I get to it, the better pleased I am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps that is true for you, but not for everyone.
<p/>I used to think so too, but here I live and think life worth living not only for that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There it's out!
<p/>here it comes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>)</div><p/>said Serpuhovskoy, laughing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ever since I heard about you, about your refusal, I began.... Of course, I approved of what you did.
<p/>But there are ways of doing everything.
<p/>And I think your action was good in itself, but you didn't do it quite in the way you ought to have done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's done can't be undone, and you know I never go back on what I've done.
<p/>And besides, I'm very well off.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well off--for the time.
<p/>But you're not satisfied with that.
<p/>I wouldn't say this to your brother.

<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) goes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) added, listening to the roar of <div class="bookquote">``hurrah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>--<div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s happy, but that does not satisfy you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't say it did satisfy me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but that's not the only thing.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By whom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By whom?
<p/>By society, by Russia.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean?
<p/>Bertenev's party against the Russian communists?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>)</div>said Serpuhovskoy, frowning with vexation at being suspected of such an absurdity.  ''
<p/>Tout √ßa est une blague .
<p/>That's always been and always will be.
<p/>There are no communists.
<p/>But intriguing people have to invent a noxious, dangerous party.
<p/>It's an old trick.
<p/>No, what's wanted is a powerful party of independent men like you and me.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky mentioned a few men who were in power.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why aren't they independent men?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Simply because they have not, or have not had from birth, an independent fortune; they've not had a name, they've not been close to the sun and center as we have.
<p/>They can be bought either by money or by favor.
<p/>And they have to find a support for themselves in inventing a policy.
<p/>And they bring forward some notion, some policy that they don't believe in, that does harm; and the whole policy is really only a means to a government house and so much income.
<p/>Cela n'est pas plus fin que √ßa , when you get a peep at their cards.
<p/>I may be inferior to them, stupider perhaps, though I don't see why I should be inferior to them.
<p/>But you and I have one important advantage over them for certain, in being more difficult to buy.
<p/>And such men are more needed than ever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky listened attentively, but he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was not so much interested by the meaning of the words as by the attitude of Serpuhovskoy who was already contemplating a struggle with the existing powers, and already had his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) likes and dislikes in that higher world, while his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own interest in the governing world did not go beyond the interests of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) regiment.
<p/>Vronsky felt, too, how powerful Serpuhovskoy might become through his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) unmistakable faculty for thinking things out and for taking things in, through his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) intelligence and gift of words, so rarely met with in the world in which he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) moved.
<p/>And, ashamed as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was of the feeling, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) felt envious.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still I haven't the one thing of most importance for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``I haven't the desire for power.
<p/>I had it once, but it's gone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, that's not true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>)</div>said Serpuhovskoy, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is true, it is true...now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky added, to be truthful.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's true now, that's another thing; but that  now  won't last forever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>answered Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say  perhaps ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>)</div>Serpuhovskoy went on, as though guessing his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thoughts, <div class="bookquote">``but I say  for certain .
<p/>And that's what I wanted to see you for.
<p/>Your action was just what it should have been.
<p/>I see that, but you ought not to keep it up.
<p/>I only ask you to give me carte blanche.
<p/>I'm not going to offer you my protection...though, indeed, why shouldn't I protect you?-- you've protected me often enough!
<p/>I should hope our friendship rises above all that sort of thing.
<p/>Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, smiling to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) as tenderly as a woman, <div class="bookquote">``give me  carte blanche , retire from the regiment, and I'll draw you upwards imperceptibly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must understand that I want nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, <div class="bookquote">``except that all should be as it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Serpuhovskoy got up and stood facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say that all should be as it is.
<p/>I understand what that means.
<p/>But listen: we're the same age, you've known a greater number of women perhaps than I have.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Serpohovskoy's smile and gestures told Vronsky that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mustn't be afraid, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) would be tender and careful in touching the sore place.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'm married, and believe me, in getting to know thoroughly one's wife, if one loves her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), as someone has said, one gets to know all women better than if one knew thousands of them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We're coming directly!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky shouted to an officer, who looked into the room and called them to the colonel.
<p/>Vronsky was longing now to hear to the end and know what Serpuhovskey would say to him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And here's my opinion for you.
<p/>Women are the chief stumbling block in a man's career.
<p/>It's hard to love a woman and do anything.
<p/>There's only one way of having love conveniently without its being a hindrance--that's marriage.
<p/>How, how am I to tell you what I mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>)</div><p/>said Serpuhovskoy, who liked similes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute, wait a minute!
<p/>Yes, just as you can only carry a fardeau  and do something with your hands, when the fardeau is tied on your back, and that's marriage.
<p/>And that's what I felt when I was married.
<p/>My hands were suddenly set free.
<p/>But to drag that  fardeau  about with you without marriage, your hands will always be so full that you can do nothing.
<p/>Look at Mazankov, at Krupov.
<p/>They've ruined their careers for the sake of women.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What women!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vronsky, recalling the Frenchwoman and the actress with whom the two men he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had mentioned were connected.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The firmer the woman's footing in society, the worse it is.
<p/>That's much the same as--not merely carrying the  fardeau  in your arms--but tearing it away from someone else.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have never loved,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>Vronsky said softly, looking straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) and thinking of Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps.
<p/>But you remember what I've said to you.
<p/>And another thing, women are all more materialistic than men.
<p/>We make something immense out of love, but they are always terre-√†-terre .''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Directly, directly!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) cried to a footman who came in.
<p/>But the footman had not come to call them again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) supposed.
<p/>The footman brought Vronsky a note.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A man brought it from Princess Tverskaya.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky opened the letter, and flushed crimson.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My head's begun to ache; I'm going home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to Serpuhovskoy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, good-bye then.
<p/>You give me  carte blanche! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll talk about it later on; I'll look you up in Petersburg.''
 (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 22   It was six o'clock already, and so, in order to be there quickly, and at the same time not to drive with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own horses, known to everyone, Vronsky got into Yashvin's hired fly, and told the driver to drive as quickly as possible.
<p/>It was a roomy, old-fashioned fly, with seats for four.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) sat in one corner, stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) legs out on the front seat, and sank into meditation.
<p/>A vague sense of the order into which his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) affairs had been brought, a vague recollection of the friendliness and flattery of Serpuhovskoy, who had considered him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) a man that was needed, and most of all, the anticipation of the interview before him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)--all blended into a general, joyous sense of life.
<p/>This feeling was so strong that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) could not help smiling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) legs, crossed one leg over the other knee, and taking it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) hand, felt the springy muscle of the calf, where it had been grazed the day before by his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) fall, and leaning back he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) drew several deep breaths.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm happy, very happy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said to himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had often before had this sense of physical joy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) own body, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had never felt so fond of himself, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) own body, as at that moment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) enjoyed the slight ache in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) strong leg, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) enjoyed the muscular sensation of movement in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) chest as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) breathed.
<p/>The bright, cold August day, which had made Anna feel so hopeless, seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) keenly stimulating, and refreshed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) face and neck that still tingled from the cold water.
<p/>The scent of brilliantine on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) whiskers struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) as particularly pleasant in the fresh air.
<p/>Everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) saw from the carriage window, everything in that cold pure air, in the pale light of the sunset, was as fresh, and gay, and strong as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was himself: the roofs of the houses shining in the rays of the setting sun, the sharp outlines of fences and angles of buildings, the figures of passers-by, the carriages that met him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) now and then, the motionless green of the trees and grass, the fields with evenly drawn furrows of potatoes, and the slanting shadows that fell from the houses, and trees, and bushes, and even from the rows of potatoes--everything was bright like a pretty landscape just finished and freshly varnished.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get on, get on!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said to the driver, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) head out of the window, and pulling a three-rouble note out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) pocket he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) handed it to the man as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) looked round.
<p/>The driver's hand fumbled with something at the lamp, the whip cracked, and the carriage rolled rapidly along the smooth highroad.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want nothing, nothing but this happiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) thought, staring at the bone button of the bell in the space between the windows, and picturing to himself Anna just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) last time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And as I go on, I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) more and more.
<p/>Here's the garden of the Vrede Villa.
<p/>Whereabouts will she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) be?
<p/>Where?
<p/>How?
<p/>Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fix on this place to meet me, and why does she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) write in Betsy's letter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) thought, wondering now for the first time at it.
<p/>But there was now no time for wonder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) called to the driver to stop before reaching the avenue, and opening the door, jumped out of the carriage as it was moving, and went into the avenue that led up to the house.
<p/>There was no one in the avenue; but looking round to the right he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) caught sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face was hidden by a veil, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) drank in with glad eyes the special movement in walking, peculiar to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) alone, the slope of the shoulders, and the setting of the head, and at once a sort of electric shock ran all over him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>With fresh force, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) felt conscious of himself from the springy motions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) legs to the movements of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) lungs as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) breathed, and something set his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) lips twitching.
<p/>Joining him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) hand tightly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not angry that I sent for you?
<p/>I absolutely had to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said; and the serious and set line of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lips, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) saw under the veil, transformed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mood at once.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I angry!
<p/>But how have you come, where from?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``come along, I must talk to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) saw that something had happened, and that the interview would not be a joyous one.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) presence he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had no will of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) own: without knowing the grounds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) distress, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) already felt the same distress unconsciously passing over him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?
<p/>what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), squeezing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) elbow, and trying to read her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thoughts in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) walked on a few steps in silence, gathering up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) courage; then suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stopped.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not tell you yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) began, breathing quickly and painfully, <div class="bookquote">``that coming home with Alexey Alexandrovitch I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) everything...told him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) I could not be his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife, that...and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), unconsciously bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) whole figure down to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as though hoping in this way to soften the hardness of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) position for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>But directly she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had said this he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) suddenly drew himself up, and a proud and hard expression came over his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, that's better, a thousand times better!
<p/>I know how painful it was,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) words, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) thoughts from the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could not guess that that expression arose from the first idea that presented itself to Vronsky--that a duel was now inevitable.
<p/>The idea of a duel had never crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) put a different interpretation on this passing expression of hardness.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) got her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew then at the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart that everything would go on in the old way, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not have the strength of will to forego her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) position, to abandon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) son, and to join her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lover.
<p/>The morning spent at Princess Tverskaya's had confirmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) still more in this.
<p/>But this interview was still of the utmost gravity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hoped that this interview would transform her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) position, and save her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>).
<p/>If on hearing this news he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) were to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) resolutely, passionately, without an instant's wavering: <div class="bookquote">``Throw up everything and come with me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) son and go away with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>But this news had not produced what she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had expected in him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) simply seemed as though he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) were resenting some affront.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not in the least painful to me.
<p/>It happened of itself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) said irritably; <div class="bookquote">``and see...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) husband's letter out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) glove.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand, I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), taking the letter, but not reading it, and trying to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The one thing I longed for, the one thing I prayed for, was to cut short this position, so as to devote my life to your happiness.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you tell me that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose I can doubt it?
<p/>If I doubted...''   (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who's that coming?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vronsky suddenly, pointing to two ladies walking towards them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps they know us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hurriedly turned off, drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) after him (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) into a side path.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't care!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) said.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) lips were quivering.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) fancied that her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) eyes looked with strange fury at him (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) from under the veil.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you that's not the point--I can't doubt that; but see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) writes to me.
<p/>Read it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) stood still again.
<p/>Again, just as at the first moment of hearing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) rupture with her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) husband, Vronsky, on reading the letter, was unconsciously carried away by the natural sensation aroused in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own relation to the betrayed husband.
<p/>Now while he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not help picturing the challenge, which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would most likely find at home today or tomorrow, and the duel itself, in which, with the same cold and haughty expression that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face was assuming at this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would await the injured husband's shot, after having himself fired into the air.
<p/>And at that instant there flashed across his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mind the thought of what Serpuhovskoy had just said to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had himself been thinking in the morning--that it was better not to bind himself --and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knew that this thought he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>).
<p/>Having read the letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>), and there was no determination in them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>) saw at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been thinking about it before by himself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>) knew that whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would not say all he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thought.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>) last hope had failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>).
<p/>This was not what she (<font color='blue'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>) had been reckoning on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see the sort of man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>) said, with a shaking voice; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)...''   (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, but I rejoice at it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Vronsky interrupted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For God's sake, let me finish!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) added, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes imploring her (<font color='blue'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>) to give him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) time to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I rejoice, because things cannot, cannot possibly remain as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) supposes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna said, restraining her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tears, and obviously attaching no sort of consequence to what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fate was sealed.
<p/>Vronsky meant that after the duel--inevitable, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought-- things could not go on as before, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said something different.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It can't go on.
<p/>I hope that now you will leave him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>I hope'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-- he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was confused, and reddened--<div class="bookquote">``that you will let me arrange and plan our life.
<p/>Tomorrow...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was beginning.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not let him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) go on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But my child!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) shrieked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) writes!
<p/>I should have to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and I can't and won't do that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, for God's sake, which is better?--leave your child, or keep up this degrading position?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To whom is it degrading?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say degrading...don't say that.
<p/>Those words have no meaning for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said in a shaking voice.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not want him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) now to say what was untrue.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had nothing left her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) but his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) love, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wanted to love him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you understand that from the day I loved you everything has changed for me?
<p/>For me there is one thing, and one thing only--your love.

<p/>I am proud of my position, because...proud of being... proud...''   (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was proud of.
<p/>Tears of shame and despair choked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) utterance.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stood still and sobbed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt, too, something swelling in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) throat and twitching in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) nose, and for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt on the point of weeping.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could not have said exactly what it was touched him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) so.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could not help her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and with that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was to blame for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wretchedness, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had done something wrong.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is not a divorce possible?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said feebly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head, not answering.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't you take your son, and still leave him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)?''

<p/>Now I must go to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said shortly.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) presentiment that all would again go on in the old way had not deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``On Tuesday I shall be in Petersburg, and everything can be settled.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't let us talk any more of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna's carriage, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had sent away, and ordered to come back to the little gate of the Vrede garden, drove up.
<p/>Anna said good-bye to Vronsky, and drove home.
<p/>Chapter 23   On Monday there was the usual sitting of the Commission of the 2nd of June.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch walked into the hall where the sitting was held, greeted the members and the president, as usual, and sat down in his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) place, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) hand on the papers laid ready before him (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>).
<p/>Among these papers lay the necessary evidence and a rough outline of the speech he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) intended to make.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) did not really need these documents.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) remembered every point, and did not think it necessary to go over in his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) memory what he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) would say.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) knew that when the time came, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) enemy facing him (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>), and studiously endeavoring to assume an expression of indifference, his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) speech would flow of itself better than he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) could prepare it now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) felt that the import of his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) speech was of such magnitude that every word of it would have weight.
<p/>Meantime, as he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) listened to the usual report, he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) had the most innocent and inoffensive air.
<p/>No one, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) white hands, with their swollen veins and long fingers, so softly stroking the edges of the white paper that lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>), and at the air of weariness with which his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) head drooped on one side, would have suspected that in a few minutes a torrent of words would flow from his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) lips that would arouse a fearful storm, set the members shouting and attacking one another, and force the president to call for order.
<p/>When the report was over, Alexey Alexandrovitch announced in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) subdued, delicate voice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had several points to bring before the meeting in regard to the Commission for the Reorganization of the Native Tribes.
<p/>All attention was turned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) throat, and not looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) opponent, but selecting, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) always did while he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was delivering his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) speeches, the first person sitting opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), an inoffensive little old man, who never had an opinion of any sort in the Commission, began to expound his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) views.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) reached the point about the fundamental and radical law, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) opponent jumped up and began to protest.
<p/>Stremov, who was also a member of the Commission, and also stung to the quick, began defending himself, and altogether a stormy sitting followed; but Alexey Alexandrovitch triumphed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) motion was carried, three new commissions were appointed, and the next day in a certain Petersburg circle nothing else was talked of but this sitting.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch's success had been even greater than he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had anticipated.
<p/>Next morning, Tuesday, Alexey Alexandrovitch, on waking up, recollected with pleasure his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) triumph of the previous day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not help smiling, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) tried to appear indifferent, when the chief secretary of his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) department, anxious to flatter him (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>), informed him (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) of the rumors that had reached him (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) concerning what had happened in the Commission.
<p/>Absorbed in business with the chief secretary, Alexey Alexandrovitch had completely forgotten that it was Tuesday, the day fixed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) for the return of Anna Arkadyevna, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was surprised and received a shock of annoyance when a servant came in to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) arrival.
<p/>Anna had arrived in Petersburg early in the morning; the carriage had been sent to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in accordance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) telegram, and so Alexey Alexandrovitch might have known of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) arrival.
<p/>But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) arrived, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had not yet gone out, but was busy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) secretary.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sent word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had come, went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own room, and occupied herself in sorting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) things, expecting he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>But an hour passed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not come.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went into the dining room on the pretext of giving some directions, and spoke loudly on purpose, expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to come out there; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not come, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) go to the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) study as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) parted from the chief secretary.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) usually went out quickly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) office, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wanted to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) before that, so that their attitude to one another might be defined.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) walked across the drawing room and went resolutely to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) study he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was in official uniform, obviously ready to go out, sitting at a little table on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) elbows, looking dejectedly before him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>On seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would have risen, but changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) mind, then his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face flushed hotly--a thing Anna had never seen before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) got up quickly and went to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), looking not at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes, but above them at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) forehead and hair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), took her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) by the hand, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to sit down.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad you have come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, sitting down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and obviously wishing to say something, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) stuttered.
<p/>Several times he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) tried to begin to speak, but stopped.
<p/>In spite of the fact that, preparing herself for meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had schooled herself to despise and reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not know what to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>And so the silence lasted for some time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Seryozha quite well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, and not waiting for an answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``I shan't be dining at home today, and I have got to go out directly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had thought of going to Moscow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you did quite, quite right to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, and was silent again.
<p/>Seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was powerless to begin the conversation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) began herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexey Alexandrovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) and not dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes under his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) persistent gaze at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hair, <div class="bookquote">``I'm a guilty woman, I'm a bad woman, but I am the same as I was, as I told you then, and I have come to tell you that I can change nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Under the influence of anger he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) apparently regained complete possession of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) faculties.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But as I told you then, and have written to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said in a thin, shrill voice, <div class="bookquote">``I repeat now, that I am not bound to know this.
<p/>I ignore it.
<p/>Not all wives are so kind as you, to be in such a hurry to communicate such agreeable news to their husbands.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) laid special emphasis on the word <div class="bookquote">``agreeable.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall ignore it so long as the world knows nothing of it, so long as my name is not disgraced.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But our relations cannot be the same as always,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>Anna began in a timid voice, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) with dismay.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw once more those composed gestures, heard that shrill, childish, and sarcastic voice, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) aversion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) extinguished her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pity for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt only afraid, but at all costs she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wanted to make clear her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) position.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot be your wife while I...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) began.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) laughed a cold and malignant laugh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The manner of life you have chosen is reflected, I suppose, in your ideas.
<p/>I have too much respect or contempt, or both...I respect your past and despise your present...that I was far from the interpretation you put on my words.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna sighed and bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Though indeed I fail to comprehend how, with the independence you show,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went on, getting hot, ''--announcing your infidelity to your husband and seeing nothing reprehensible in it, apparently--you can see anything reprehensible in performing a wife's duties in relation to your husband.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexey Alexandrovitch!
<p/>What is it you want of me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you not to meet that man here, and to conduct yourself so that neither the world nor the servants can reproach you...not to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>That's not much, I think.
<p/>And in return you will enjoy all the privileges of a faithful wife without fulfilling her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) duties.
<p/>That's all I have to say to you.
<p/>Now it's time for me to go.
<p/>I'm not dining at home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up and moved towards the door.
<p/>Anna got up too.
<p/>Bowing in silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pass before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 24   The night spent by Levin on the haycock did not pass without result for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>The way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been managing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) land revolted him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and had lost all attraction for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>In spite of the magnificent harvest, never had there been, or, at least, never it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), had there been so many hindrances and so many quarrels between him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and the peasants as that year, and the origin of these failures and this hostility was now perfectly comprehensible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>The delight he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had experienced in the work itself, and the consequent greater intimacy with the peasants, the envy he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt of them, of their life, the desire to adopt that life, which had been to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that night not a dream but an intention, the execution of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had thought out in detail --all this had so transformed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) view of the farming of the land as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had managed it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not take his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) former interest in it, and could not help seeing that unpleasant relation between him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and the workpeople which was the foundation of it all.
<p/>The herd of improved cows such as Pava, the whole land ploughed over and enriched, the nine level fields surrounded with hedges, the two hundred and forty acres heavily manured, the seed sown in drills, and all the rest of it--it was all splendid if only the work had been done for themselves, or for themselves and comrades --people in sympathy with them.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw clearly now -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) work on a book of agriculture, in which the chief element in husbandry was to have been the laborer, greatly assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) in this-RRB- that the sort of farming he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) was carrying on was nothing but a cruel and stubborn struggle between him (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) and the laborers, in which there was on one side--his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) side--a continual intense effort to change everything to a pattern he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) considered better; on the other side, the natural order of things.
<p/>And in this struggle he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) saw that with immense expenditure of force on his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) side, and with no effort or even intention on the other side, all that was attained was that the work did not go to the liking of either side, and that splendid tools, splendid cattle and land were spoiled with no good to anyone.
<p/>Worst of all, the energy expended on this work was not simply wasted.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) could not help feeling now, since the meaning of this system had become clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>), that the aim of his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) energy was a most unworthy one.
<p/>In reality, what was the struggle about?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) was struggling for every farthing of his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) share -LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) could not help it, for he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) had only to relax his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) efforts, and he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) would not have had the money to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) laborers' wages-RRB-, while they were only struggling to be able to do their work easily and agreeably, that is to say, as they were used to doing it.
<p/>It was for his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) interests that every laborer should work as hard as possible, and that while doing so he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) should keep his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) wits about him (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>), so as to try not to break the winnowing machines, the horse rakes, the thrashing machines, that he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) should attend to what he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) was doing.
<p/>What the laborer wanted was to work as pleasantly as possible, with rests, and above all, carelessly and heedlessly, without thinking.
<p/>That summer Levin saw this at every step.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sent the men to mow some clover for hay, picking out the worst patches where the clover was overgrown with grass and weeds and of no use for seed; again and again they mowed the best acres of clover, justifying themselves by the pretense that the bailiff had told them to, and trying to pacify him (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) with the assurance that it would be splendid hay; but he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) knew that it was owing to those acres being so much easier to mow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) sent out a hay machine for pitching the hay--it was broken at the first row because it was dull work for a peasant to sit on the seat in front with the great wings waving above him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>).
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was told, <div class="bookquote">``Don't trouble, your honor, sure, the womenfolks will pitch it quick enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The ploughs were practically useless, because it never occurred to the laborer to raise the share when he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) turned the plough, and forcing it round, he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) strained the horses and tore up the ground, and Levin was begged not to mind about it.
<p/>The horses were allowed to stray into the wheat because not a single laborer would consent to be night-watchman, and in spite of orders to the contrary, the laborers insisted on taking turns for night duty, and Ivan, after working all day long, fell asleep, and was very penitent for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) fault, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Do what you will to me, your honor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Parmenov</b></font>)</div><p/>They killed three of the best calves by letting them into the clover aftermath without care as to their drinking, and nothing would make the men believe that they had been blown out by the clover, but they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), by way of consolation, that one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) neighbors had lost a hundred and twelve head of cattle in three days.
<p/>All this happened, not because anyone felt ill-will to Levin or his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) farm; on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew that they liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) a simple gentleman -LRB-their highest praise-RRB-; but it happened simply because all they wanted was to work merrily and carelessly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) interests were not only remote and incomprehensible to them, but fatally opposed to their most just claims.
<p/>Long before, Levin had felt dissatisfaction with his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) own position in regard to the land.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) saw where his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) boat leaked, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) did not look for the leak, perhaps purposely deceiving himself.
<p/>-LRB-Nothing would be left him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) lost faith in it.-RRB-
<p/>But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) could deceive himself no longer.
<p/>The farming of the land, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) was managing it, had become not merely unattractive but revolting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) could take no further interest in it.
<p/>To this now was joined the presence, only twenty-five miles off, of Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) longed to see and could not see.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna Oblonskaya had invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) was over there, to come; to come with the object of renewing his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) offer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) sister, who would, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) to understand, accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) now.
<p/>Levin himself had felt on seeing Kitty Shtcherbatskaya that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had never ceased to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not go over to the Oblonskys', knowing she (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) was there.
<p/>The fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) an offer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) had refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), had placed an insuperable barrier between her (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) and him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).

<p/>The thought of this made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cold and hostile to her (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not be able to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) without a feeling of reproach; I could not look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) without resentment; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) will only hate me all the more, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)'s bound to.

<p/>What induced Darya Alexandrovna to tell me that?
<p/>By chance I might have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>), then everything would have happened of itself; but, as it is, it's out of the question, out of the question!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>Darya Alexandrovna sent him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) a letter, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) for a side-saddle for Kitty's use.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm told you have a side-saddle,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I hope you will bring it over yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>This was more than he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) could stand.
<p/>How could a woman of any intelligence, of any delicacy, put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sister in such a humiliating position!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) wrote ten notes, and tore them all up, and sent the saddle without any reply.
<p/>To write that he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would go was impossible, because he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) could not go; to write that he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) could not come because something prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), or that he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would be away, that was still worse.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) sent the saddle without an answer, and with a sense of having done something shameful; he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) handed over all the now revolting business of the estate to the bailiff, and set off next day to a remote district to see his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) friend Sviazhsky, who had splendid marshes for grouse in his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) neighborhood, and had lately written to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) to keep a long-standing promise to stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>).
<p/>The grouse-marsh, in the Surovsky district, had long tempted Levin, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had continually put off this visit on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) work on the estate.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was glad to get away from the neighborhood of the Shtcherbatskys, and still more from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) farm work, especially on a shooting expedition, which always in trouble served as the best consolation.
<p/>Chapter 25   In the Surovsky district there was no railway nor service of post horses, and Levin drove there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own horses in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) big, old-fashioned carriage.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stopped halfway at a well-to-do peasant's to feed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) horses.
<p/>A bald, well-preserved old man, with a broad, red beard, gray on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheeks, opened the gate, squeezing against the gatepost to let the three horses pass.
<p/>Directing the coachman to a place under the shed in the big, clean, tidy yard, with charred, old-fashioned ploughs in it, the old man asked Levin to come into the parlor.
<p/>A cleanly dressed young woman, with clogs on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bare feet, was scrubbing the floor in the new outer room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was frightened of the dog, that ran in after Levin, and uttered a shriek, but began laughing at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own fright at once when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was told the dog would not hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Pointing Levin with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bare arm to the door into the parlor, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bent down again, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) handsome face, and went on scrubbing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you like the samovar?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The parlor was a big room, with a Dutch stove, and a screen dividing it into two.
<p/>Under the holy pictures stood a table painted in patterns, a bench, and two chairs.
<p/>Near the entrance was a dresser full of crockery.
<p/>The shutters were closed, there were few flies, and it was so clean that Levin was anxious that Laska, who had been running along the road and bathing in puddles, should not muddy the floor, and ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to a place in the corner by the door.
<p/>After looking round the parlor, Levin went out in the back yard.
<p/>The good-looking young woman in clogs, swinging the empty pails on the yoke, ran on before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to the well for water.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look sharp, my girl!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>the old man shouted after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), good-humoredly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went up to Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, are you going to Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky?
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) honor comes to us too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began, chatting, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) elbows on the railing of the steps.
<p/>In the middle of the old man's account of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) acquaintance with Sviazhsky, the gates creaked again, and laborers came into the yard from the fields, with wooden ploughs and harrows.
<p/>The horses harnessed to the ploughs and harrows were sleek and fat.
<p/>The laborers were obviously of the household: two were young men in cotton shirts and caps, the two others were hired laborers in homespun shirts, one an old man, the other a young fellow.
<p/>Moving off from the steps, the old man went up to the horses and began unharnessing them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have they been ploughing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ploughing up the potatoes.
<p/>We rent a bit of land too.
<p/>Fedot, don't let out the gelding, but take it to the trough, and we'll put the other in harness.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, father, the ploughshares I ordered, has he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brought them along?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the fellow son</b></font>)</div><p/>asked the big, healthy-looking fellow, obviously the old man's son.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There...in the outer room,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the old man, bundling together the harness he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had taken off, and flinging it on the ground.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can put them on, while they have dinner.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The good-looking young woman came into the outer room with the full pails dragging at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/>More women came on the scene from somewhere, young and handsome, middle-aged, old and ugly, with children and without children.
<p/>The samovar was beginning to sing; the laborers and the family, having disposed of the horses, came in to dinner.
<p/>Levin, getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) provisions out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) carriage, invited the old man to take tea with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I have had some today already,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, obviously accepting the invitation with pleasure.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But just a glass for company.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Over their tea Levin heard all about the old man's farming.
<p/>Ten years before, the old man had rented three hundred acres from the lady who owned them, and a year ago he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had bought them and rented another three hundred from a neighboring landowner.
<p/>A small part of the land--the worst part--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let out for rent, while a hundred acres of arable land he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cultivated himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family and two hired laborers.
<p/>The old man complained that things were doing badly.
<p/>But Levin saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) simply did so from a feeling of propriety, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) farm was in a flourishing condition.
<p/>If it had been unsuccessful he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would not have bought land at thirty-five roubles the acre, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would not have married his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) three sons and a nephew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would not have rebuilt twice after fires, and each time on a larger scale.
<p/>In spite of the old man's complaints, it was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was proud, and justly proud, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prosperity, proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sons, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nephew, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sons' wives, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horses and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cows, and especially of the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was keeping all this farming going.
<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conversation with the old man, Levin thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not averse to new methods either.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had planted a great many potatoes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) potatoes, as Levin had seen driving past, were already past flowering and beginning to die down, while Levin's were only just coming into flower.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) earthed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) potatoes with a modern plough borrowed from a neighboring landowner.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sowed wheat.
<p/>The trifling fact that, thinning out his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) rye, the old man used the rye he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinned out for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horses, specially struck Levin.
<p/>How many times had Levin seen this splendid fodder wasted, and tried to get it saved; but always it had turned out to be impossible.
<p/>The peasant got this done, and he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) could not say enough in praise of it as food for the beasts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have the wenches to do?
<p/>They carry it out in bundles to the roadside, and the cart brings it away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we landowners can't manage well with our laborers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, handing him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) a glass of tea.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took the glass, but refused sugar, pointing to a lump he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had left.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're simple destruction,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at Sviazhsky's, for instance.
<p/>We know what the land's like--first-rate, yet there's not much of a crop to boast of.
<p/>It's not looked after enough--that's all it is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you work your land with hired laborers?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We're all peasants together.
<p/>We go into everything ourselves.
<p/>If a man's no use, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can go, and we can manage by ourselves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, Finogen wants some tar,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the young woman in the clogs, coming in.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, that's how it is, sir!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>said the old man, getting up, and crossing himself deliberately, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thanked Levin and went out.
<p/>When Levin went into the kitchen to call his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) coachman he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw the whole family at dinner.
<p/>The women were standing up waiting on them.
<p/>The young, sturdy-looking son was telling something funny with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mouth full of pudding, and they were all laughing, the woman in the clogs, who was pouring cabbage soup into a bowl, laughing most merrily of all.
<p/>Very probably the good-looking face of the young woman in the clogs had a good deal to do with the impression of well-being this peasant household made upon Levin, but the impression was so strong that Levin could never get rid of it.
<p/>And all the way from the old peasant's to Sviazhsky's he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) kept recalling this peasant farm as though there were something in this impression that demanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) special attention.
<p/>Chapter 26   Sviazhsky was the marshal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) district.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was five years older than Levin, and had long been married.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sister-in-law, a young girl Levin liked very much, lived in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) house; and Levin knew that Sviazhsky and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife would have greatly liked to marry the girl to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew this with certainty, as so-called eligible young men always know it, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could never have brought himself to speak of it to anyone; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew too that, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wanted to get married, and although by every token this very attractive girl would make an excellent wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could no more have married her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not been in love with Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could have flown up to the sky.
<p/>And this knowledge poisoned the pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had hoped to find in the visit to Sviazhsky.
<p/>On getting Sviazhsky's letter with the invitation for shooting, Levin had immediately thought of this; but in spite of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind that Sviazhsky's having such views for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was simply his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own groundless supposition, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would go, all the same.
<p/>Besides, at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had a desire to try himself, put himself to the test in regard to this girl.
<p/>The Sviazhskys' home-life was exceedingly pleasant, and Sviazhsky himself, the best type of man taking part in local affairs that Levin knew, was very interesting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Sviazhsky was one of those people, always a source of wonder to Levin, whose convictions, very logical though never original, go one way by themselves, while their life, exceedingly definite and firm in its direction, goes its way quite apart and almost always in direct contradiction to their convictions.
<p/>Sviazhsky was an extremely advanced man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) despised the nobility, and believed the mass of the nobility to be secretly in favor of serfdom, and only concealing their views from cowardice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regarded Russia as a ruined country, rather after the style of Turkey, and the government of Russia as so bad that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never permitted himself to criticize its doings seriously, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a functionary of that government and a model marshal of nobility, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drove about he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always wore the cockade of office and the cap with the red band.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) considered human life only tolerable abroad, and went abroad to stay at every opportunity, and at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carried on a complex and improved system of agriculture in Russia, and with extreme interest followed everything and knew everything that was being done in Russia.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) considered the Russian peasant as occupying a stage of development intermediate between the ape and the man, and at the same time in the local assemblies no one was readier to shake hands with the peasants and listen to their opinion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed neither in God nor the devil, but was much concerned about the question of the improvement of the clergy and the maintenance of their revenues, and took special trouble to keep up the church in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) village.
<p/>On the woman question he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was on the side of the extreme advocates of complete liberty for women, and especially their right to labor.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) lived with his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) wife on such terms that their affectionate childless home life was the admiration of everyone, and arranged his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) wife's life so that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did nothing and could do nothing but share her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's efforts that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) time should pass as happily and as agreeably as possible.
<p/>If it had not been a characteristic of Levin's to put the most favorable interpretation on people, Sviazhsky's character would have presented no doubt or difficulty to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) would have said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``a fool or a knave,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and everything would have seemed clear.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) could not say <div class="bookquote">``a fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>because Sviazhsky was unmistakably clever, and moreover, a highly cultivated man, who was exceptionally modest over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) culture.
<p/>There was not a subject he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew nothing of.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not display his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knowledge except when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was compelled to do so.
<p/>Still less could Levin say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was a knave, as Sviazhsky was unmistakably an honest, good-hearted, sensible man, who worked good-humoredly, keenly, and perseveringly at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was held in high honor by everyone about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never consciously done, and was indeed incapable of doing, anything base.
<p/>Levin tried to understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and could not understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) life as at a living enigma.
<p/>Levin and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) were very friendly, and so Levin used to venture to sound Sviazhsky, to try to get at the very foundation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) view of life; but it was always in vain.
<p/>Every time Levin tried to penetrate beyond the outer chambers of Sviazhsky's mind, which were hospitably open to all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) noticed that Sviazhsky was slightly disconcerted; faint signs of alarm were visible in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) were afraid Levin would understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) a kindly, good-humored repulse.
<p/>Just now, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) disenchantment with farming, Levin was particularly glad to stay with Sviazhsky.
<p/>Apart from the fact that the sight of this happy and affectionate couple, so pleased with themselves and everyone else, and their well-ordered home had always a cheering effect on Levin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt a longing, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was so dissatisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own life, to get at that secret in Sviazhsky that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) such clearness, definiteness, and good courage in life.
<p/>Moreover, Levin knew that at Sviazhsky's he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) should meet the landowners of the neighborhood, and it was particularly interesting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) just now to hear and take part in those rural conversations concerning crops, laborers' wages, and so on, which, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was aware, are conventionally regarded as something very low, but which seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) just now to constitute the one subject of importance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not, perhaps, of importance in the days of serfdom, and it may not be of importance in England.
<p/>In both cases the conditions of agriculture are firmly established; but among us now, when everything has been turned upside down and is only just taking shape, the question what form these conditions will take is the one question of importance in Russia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>thought Levin.
<p/>The shooting turned out to be worse than Levin had expected.
<p/>The marsh was dry and there were no grouse at all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) walked about the whole day and only brought back three birds, but to make up for that--he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brought back, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) always did from shooting, an excellent appetite, excellent spirits, and that keen, intellectual mood which with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) always accompanied violent physical exertion.
<p/>And while out shooting, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) seemed to be thinking of nothing at all, suddenly the old man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family kept coming back to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, and the impression of them seemed to claim not merely his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attention, but the solution of some question connected with them.
<p/>In the evening at tea, two landowners who had come about some business connected with a wardship were of the party, and the interesting conversation Levin had been looking forward to sprang up.
<p/>Levin was sitting beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hostess at the tea table, and was obliged to keep up a conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) sister, who was sitting opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Madame Sviazhskaya was a round-faced, fair-haired, rather short woman, all smiles and dimples.
<p/>Levin tried through her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to get a solution of the weighty enigma her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband presented to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not complete freedom of ideas, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was in an agony of embarrassment.
<p/>This agony of embarrassment was due to the fact that the sister-in-law was sitting opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), in a dress, specially put on, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fancied, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) benefit, cut particularly open, in the shape of a trapeze, on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) white bosom.
<p/>This quadrangular opening, in spite of the bosom's being very white, or just because it was very white, deprived Levin of the full use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) faculties.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) imagined, probably mistakenly, that this low-necked bodice had been made on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) account, and felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had no right to look at it, and tried not to look at it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was to blame for the very fact of the low-necked bodice having been made.
<p/>It seemed to Levin that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had deceived someone, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ought to explain something, but that to explain it was impossible, and for that reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was continually blushing, was ill at ease and awkward.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) awkwardness infected the pretty sister-in-law too.
<p/>But their hostess appeared not to observe this, and kept purposely drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) into the conversation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) said, pursuing the subject that had been started, <div class="bookquote">``that my husband cannot be interested in what's Russian.
<p/>It's quite the contrary; he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) is always in cheerful spirits abroad, but not as he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) is here.
<p/>Here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) feels in his (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) proper place.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) has so much to do, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) has the faculty of interesting himself in everything.

 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Levin, trying to look above the open neck, but feeling that wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looked in that direction he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) should see it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I used to teach in it myself, and do teach still, but we have a first-rate schoolmistress now.
<p/>And we've started gymnastic exercises.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, I won't have any more tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, and conscious of doing a rude thing, but incapable of continuing the conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) got up, blushing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear a very interesting conversation,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) added, and walked to the other end of the table, where Sviazhsky was sitting with the two gentlemen of the neighborhood.
<p/>Sviazhsky was sitting sideways, with one elbow on the table, and a cup in one hand, while with the other hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gathered up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) beard, held it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) nose and let it drop again, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) were smelling it.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brilliant black eyes were looking straight at the excited country gentleman with gray whiskers, and apparently he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) derived amusement from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) remarks.
<p/>The gentleman was complaining of the peasants.
<p/>It was evident to Levin that Sviazhsky knew an answer to this gentleman's complaints, which would at once demolish his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) whole contention, but that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) position he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not give utterance to this answer, and listened, not without pleasure, to the landowner's comic speeches.
<p/>The gentleman with the gray whiskers was obviously an inveterate adherent of serfdom and a devoted agriculturist, who had lived all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) life in the country.
<p/>Levin saw proofs of this in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dress, in the old-fashioned threadbare coat, obviously not his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) everyday attire, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shrewd, deep-set eyes, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) idiomatic, fluent Russian, in the imperious tone that had become habitual from long use, and in the resolute gestures of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) large, red, sunburnt hands, with an old betrothal ring on the little finger.
<p/>Chapter 27   <div class="bookquote">``If I'd only the heart to throw up what's been set going...such a lot of trouble wasted...I'd turn my back on the whole business, sell up, go off like Nikolay Ivanovitch...to hear  La Belle H√©l√®ne ,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landowner smile</b></font>)</div>said the landowner, a pleasant smile lighting up his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) shrewd old face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you see you don't throw it up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>said Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky; <div class="bookquote">``so there must be something gained.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The only gain is that I live in my own house, neither bought nor hired.
<p/>Besides, one keeps hoping the people will learn sense.
<p/>Though, instead of that, you'd never believe it--the drunkenness, the immorality!
<p/>They keep chopping and changing their bits of land.
<p/>Not a sight of a horse or a cow.
<p/>The peasant's dying of hunger, but just go and take him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) on as a laborer, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>)'ll do his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) best to do you a mischief, and then bring you up before the justice of the peace.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But then you make complaints to the justice too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>said Sviazhsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I lodge complaints?
<p/>Not for anything in the world!
<p/>Such a talking, and such a to-do, that one would have cause to regret it.
<p/>At the works, for instance, they pocketed the advance-money and made off.
<p/>What did the justice do?
<p/>Why, acquitted them.
<p/>Nothing keeps them in order but their own communal court and their village elder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'ll flog them in the good old style!
<p/>But for that there'd be nothing for it but to give it all up and run away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the landowner</b></font>)</div><p/>Obviously the landowner was chaffing Sviazhsky, who, far from resenting it, was apparently amused by it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you see we manage our land without such extreme measures,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>), smiling: <div class="bookquote">``Levin and I and this gentleman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) indicated the other landowner.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the thing's done at Mihail Petrovitch's, but ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) how it's done.
<p/>Do you call that a rational system?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the landowner</b></font>)</div><p/>said the landowner, obviously rather proud of the word <div class="bookquote">``rational.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the landowner</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My system's very simple,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mihail Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>said Mihail Petrovitch, <div class="bookquote">``thank God.
<p/>All my management rests on getting the money ready for the autumn taxes, and the peasants come to me, `Father, master, help us!'
<p/>Well, the peasants are all one's neighbors; one feels for them.
<p/>So one advances them a third, but one says: `Remember, lads, I have helped you, and you must help me when I need it--whether it's the sowing of the oats, or the haycutting, or the harvest'; and well, one agrees, so much for each taxpayer--though there are dishonest ones among them too, it's true.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mihail Petrovitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin, who had long been familiar with these patriarchal methods, exchanged glances with Sviazhsky and interrupted Mihail Petrovitch, turning again to the gentleman with the gray whiskers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what do you think?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) asked; <div class="bookquote">``what system is one to adopt nowadays?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, manage like Mihail Petrovitch, or let the land for half the crop or for rent to the peasants; that one can do--only that's just how the general prosperity of the country is being ruined.
<p/>Where the land with serf-labor and good management gave a yield of nine to one, on the half-crop system it yields three to one.
<p/>Russia has been ruined by the emancipation!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Sviazhsky looked with smiling eyes at Levin, and even made a faint gesture of irony to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>); but Levin did not think the landowner's words absurd, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) understood them better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did Sviazhsky.
<p/>A great deal more of what the gentleman with the gray whiskers said to show in what way Russia was ruined by the emancipation struck him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) indeed as very true, new to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and quite incontestable.
<p/>The landowner unmistakably spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) own individual thought--a thing that very rarely happens--and a thought to which he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) had been brought not by a desire of finding some exercise for an idle brain, but a thought which had grown up out of the conditions of his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) life, which he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) had brooded over in the solitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) village, and had considered in every aspect.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The point is, don't you see, that progress of every sort is only made by the use of authority,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) said, evidently wishing to show he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) was not without culture.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take the reforms of Peter, of Catherine, of Alexander.
<p/>Take European history.
<p/>And progress in agriculture more than anything else--the potato, for instance, that was introduced among us by force.
<p/>The wooden plough too wasn't always used.
<p/>It was introduced maybe in the days before the Empire, but it was probably brought in by force.
<p/>Now, in our own day, we landowners in the serf times used various improvements in our husbandry: drying machines and thrashing machines, and carting manure and all the modern implements--all that we brought into use by our authority, and the peasants opposed it at first, and ended by imitating us.
<p/>Now, by the abolition of serfdom we have been deprived of our authority; and so our husbandry, where it had been raised to a high level, is bound to sink to the most savage primitive condition.
<p/>That's how I see it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why so?
<p/>If it's rational, you'll be able to keep up the same system with hired labor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>said Sviazhsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've no power over them.
<p/>With whom am I going to work the system, allow me to ask?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There it is--the labor force--the chief element in agriculture,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>thought Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``With laborers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The laborers won't work well, and won't work with good implements.
<p/>Our laborer can do nothing but get drunk like a pig, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>)'s drunk he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) ruins everything you give him (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) makes the horses ill with too much water, cuts good harness, barters the tires of the wheels for drink, drops bits of iron into the thrashing machine, so as to break it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) loathes the sight of anything that's not after his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) fashion.
<p/>And that's how it is the whole level of husbandry has fallen.
<p/>Lands gone out of cultivation, overgrown with weeds, or divided among the peasants, and where millions of bushels were raised you get a hundred thousand; the wealth of the country has decreased.
<p/>If the same thing had been done, but with care that...''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) proceeded to unfold his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) own scheme of emancipation by means of which these drawbacks might have been avoided.
<p/>This did not interest Levin, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had finished, Levin went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) first position, and, addressing Sviazhsky, and trying to draw him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) into expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) serious opinion:--  <div class="bookquote">``That the standard of culture is falling, and that with our present relations to the peasants there is no possibility of farming on a rational system to yield a profit--that's perfectly true,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>Sviazhsky replied quite seriously; <div class="bookquote">``all I see is that we don't know how to cultivate the land, and that our system of agriculture in the serf days was by no means too high, but too low.
<p/>We have no machines, no good stock, no efficient supervision; we don't even know how to keep accounts.
<p/>Ask any landowner; he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) won't be able to tell you what crop's profitable, and what's not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Italian bookkeeping,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman of the gray whiskers ironically.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may keep your books as you like, but if they spoil everything for you, there won't be any profit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do they spoil things?
<p/>A poor thrashing machine, or your Russian presser, they will break, but my steam press they don't break.
<p/>A wretched Russian nag they'll ruin, but keep good dray-horses--they won't ruin them.
<p/>And so it is all round.
<p/>We must raise our farming to a higher level.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if one only had the means to do it, Nikolay Ivanovitch!
<p/>It's all very well for you; but for me, with a son to keep at the university, lads to be educated at the high school--how am I going to buy these dray-horses?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's what the land banks are for.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To get what's left me sold by auction?
<p/>No, thank you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't agree that it's necessary or possible to raise the level of agriculture still higher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I devote myself to it, and I have means, but I can do nothing.
<p/>As to the banks, I don't know to whom they're any good.
<p/>For my part, anyway, whatever I've spent money on in the way of husbandry, it has been a loss:  stock--a loss, machinery--a loss.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>the gentleman with the gray whiskers chimed in, positively laughing with satisfaction.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'm not the only one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>pursued Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mix with all the neighboring landowners, who are cultivating their land on a rational system; they all, with rare exceptions, are doing so at a loss.
<p/>Come, tell us how does your land do--does it pay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, and at once in Sviazhsky's eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) detected that fleeting expression of alarm which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had noticed whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had tried to penetrate beyond the outer chambers of Sviazhsky's mind.
<p/>Moreover, this question on Levin's part was not quite in good faith.
<p/>Madame Sviazhskaya had just told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) at tea that they had that summer invited a German expert in bookkeeping from Moscow, who for a consideration of five hundred roubles had investigated the management of their property, and found that it was costing them a loss of three thousand odd roubles.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) did not remember the precise sum, but it appeared that the German had worked it out to the fraction of a farthing.
<p/>The gray-whiskered landowner smiled at the mention of the profits of Sviazhsky's famling, obviously aware how much gain his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) neighbor and marshal was likely to be making.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly it does not pay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>answered Sviazhsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That merely proves either that I'm a bad manager, or that I've sunk my capital for the increase of my rents.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, rent!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin cried with horror.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rent there may be in Europe, where land has been improved by the labor put into it, but with us all the land is deteriorating from the labor put into it--in other words they're working it out; so there's no question of rent.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How no rent?
<p/>It's a law.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we're outside the law; rent explains nothing for us, but simply muddles us.
<p/>No, tell me how there can be a theory of rent?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you have some junket?
<p/>Masha, pass us some junket or raspberries.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Extraordinarily late the raspberries are lasting this year.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/>And in the happiest frame of mind Sviazhsky got up and walked off, apparently supposing the conversation to have ended at the very point when to Levin it seemed that it was only just beginning.
<p/>Having lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) antagonist, Levin continued the conversation with the gray-whiskered landowner, trying to prove to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that all the difficulty arises from the fact that we don't find out the peculiarities and habits of our laborer; but the landowner, like all men who think independently and in isolation, was slow in taking in any other person's idea, and particularly partial to his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) own.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) stuck to it that the Russian peasant is a swine and likes swinishness, and that to get him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) swinishness one must have authority, and there is none; one must have the stick, and we have become so liberal that we have all of a sudden replaced the stick that served us for a thousand years by lawyers and model prisons, where the worthless, stinking peasant is fed on good soup and has a fixed allowance of cubic feet of air.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, trying to get back to the question, <div class="bookquote">``that it's impossible to find some relation to the laborer in which the labor would become productive?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That never could be so with the Russian peasantry; we've no power over them,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landowner</b></font>)</div>answered the landowner.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can new conditions be found?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Sviazhsky.
<p/>Having eaten some junket and lighted a cigarette, he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) came back to the discussion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All possible relations to the labor force have been defined and studied,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The relic of barbarism, the primitive commune with each guarantee for all, will disappear of itself; serfdom has been abolished--there remains nothing but free labor, and its forms are fixed and ready made, and must be adopted.
<p/>Permanent hands, day-laborers, rammers--you can't get out of those forms.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Europe is dissatisfied with these forms.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dissatisfied, and seeking new ones.
<p/>And will find them, in all probability.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just what I was meaning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't we seek them for ourselves?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it would be just like inventing afresh the means for constructing railways.
<p/>They are ready, invented.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if they don't do for us, if they're stupid?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin.
<p/>And again he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) detected the expression of alarm in the eyes of Sviazhsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; we'll bury the world under our caps!
<p/>We've found the secret Europe was seeking for!
<p/>I've heard all that; but, excuse me, do you know all that's been done in Europe on the question of the organization of labor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, very little.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That question is now absorbing the best minds in Europe.
<p/>The Schulze-Delitsch movement.... And then all this enormous literature of the labor question, the most liberal Lassalle movement...the Mulhausen experiment?
<p/>That's a fact by now, as you're probably aware.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have some idea of it, but very vague.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you only say that; no doubt you know all about it as well as I do.
<p/>I'm not a professor of sociology, of course, but it interested me, and really, if it interests you, you ought to study it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what conclusion have they come to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me...''   (<font color='red'><b>The neighbors</b></font>)</div>The two neighbors had risen, and Sviazhsky, once more checking Levin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) inconvenient habit of peeping into what was beyond the outer chambers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind, went to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) guests out.
<p/>Chapter 28   Levin was insufferably bored that evening with the ladies; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was stirred as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had never been before by the idea that the dissatisfaction he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was feeling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) system of managing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) land was not an exceptional case, but the general condition of things in Russia; that the organization of some relation of the laborers to the soil in which they would work, as with the peasant he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had met half-way to the Sviazhskys', was not a dream, but a problem which must be solved.
<p/>And it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) that the problem could be solved, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) ought to try and solve it.
<p/>After saying good-night to the ladies, and promising to stay the whole of the next day, so as to make an expedition on horseback with them to see an interesting ruin in the crown forest, Levin went, before going to bed, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) host's study to get the books on the labor question that Sviazhsky had offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Sviazhsky's study was a huge room, surrounded by bookcases and with two tables in it--one a massive writing table, standing in the middle of the room, and the other a round table, covered with recent numbers of reviews and journals in different languages, ranged like the rays of a star round the lamp.
<p/>On the writing table was a stand of drawers marked with gold lettering, and full of papers of various sorts.
<p/>Sviazhsky took out the books, and sat down in a rocking-chair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you looking at there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said to Levin, who was standing at the round table looking through the reviews.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, there's a very interesting article here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>said Sviazhsky of the review Levin was holding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It appears,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went on, with eager interest, <div class="bookquote">``that Friedrich was not, after all, the person chiefly responsible for the partition of Poland.
<p/>It is proved...''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And with his (<font color='blue'><b>Friedrich</b></font>) characteristic clearness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Friedrich</b></font>) summed up those new, very important, and interesting revelations.
<p/>Although Levin was engrossed at the moment by his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ideas about the problem of the land, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wondered, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard Sviazhsky: <div class="bookquote">``What is there inside of him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)?
<p/>And why, why is he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) interested in the partition of Poland?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/>When Sviazhsky had finished, Levin could not help asking: <div class="bookquote">``Well, and what then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>But there was nothing to follow.
<p/>It was simply interesting that it had been proved to be so and so.
<p/>But Sviazhsky did not explain, and saw no need to explain why it was interesting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I was very much interested by your irritable neighbor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, sighing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s a clever fellow, and said a lot that was true.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, get along with you!
<p/>An inveterate supporter of serfdom at heart, like all of them!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Sviazhsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose marshal you are.''

<p/>The day before yesterday, I met a peasant woman in the evening with a little baby, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was going.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was going to the wise woman; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) boy had screaming fits, so she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was taking him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to be doctored.
<p/>I asked, `Why, how does the wise woman cure screaming fits?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Levin.
<p/>But there was a gleam of alarm in Sviazhsky's eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said smiling:  <div class="bookquote">``No; that screaming story is positively capital!
<p/>Did you really hear it yourself?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not to discover the connection between this man's life and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thoughts.
<p/>Obviously he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not care in the least what his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) reasoning led him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to; all he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wanted was the process of reasoning.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not like it when the process of reasoning brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) into a blind alley.
<p/>That was the only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) disliked, and avoided by changing the conversation to something agreeable and amusing.
<p/>All the impressions of the day, beginning with the impression made by the old peasant, which served, as it were, as the fundamental basis of all the conceptions and ideas of the day, threw Levin into violent excitement.
<p/>This dear good Sviazhsky, keeping a stock of ideas simply for social purposes, and obviously having some other principles hidden from Levin, while with the crowd, whose name is legion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) guided public opinion by ideas he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not share; that irascible country gentleman, perfectly correct in the conclusions that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been worried into by life, but wrong in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) exasperation against a whole class, and that the best class in Russia; his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own dissatisfaction with the work he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been doing, and the vague hope of finding a remedy for all this--all was blended in a sense of inward turmoil, and anticipation of some solution near at hand.
<p/>Left alone in the room assigned him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), lying on a spring mattress that yielded unexpectedly at every movement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arm or his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) leg, Levin did not fall asleep for a long while.
<p/>Not one conversation with Sviazhsky, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had said a great deal that was clever, had interested Levin; but the conclusions of the irascible landowner required consideration.
<p/>Levin could not help recalling every word he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had said, and in imagination amending his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own replies.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I ought to have said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>): You say that our husbandry does not answer because the peasant hates improvements, and that they must be forced on him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) by authority.
<p/>If no system of husbandry answered at all without these improvements, you would be quite right.
<p/>But the only system that does answer is where laborer is working in accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) habits, just as on the old peasant's land half-way here.
<p/>Your and our general dissatisfaction with the system shows that either we are to blame or the laborers.
<p/>We have gone our way--the European way--a long while, without asking ourselves about the qualities of our labor force.
<p/>Let us try to look upon the labor force not as an abstract force, but as the  Russian peasant  with his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) instincts, and we shall arrange our system of culture in accordance with that.
<p/>Imagine, I ought to have said to him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>), that you have the same system as the old peasant has, that you have found means of making your laborers take an interest in the success of the work, and have found the happy mean in the way of improvements which they will admit, and you will, without exhausting the soil, get twice or three times the yield you got before.
<p/>Divide it in halves, give half as the share of labor, the surplus left you will be greater, and the share of labor will be greater too.
<p/>And to do this one must lower the standard of husbandry and interest the laborers in its success.
<p/>How to do this?--that's a matter of detail; but undoubtedly it can be done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>This idea threw Levin into a great excitement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not sleep half the night, thinking over in detail the putting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) idea into practice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not intended to go away next day, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) now determined to go home early in the morning.
<p/>Besides, the sister-in-law with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) low-necked bodice aroused in him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) a feeling akin to shame and remorse for some utterly base action.
<p/>Most important of all--he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must get back without delay: he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would have to make haste to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) new project to the peasants before the sowing of the winter wheat, so that the sowing might be undertaken on a new basis.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind to revolutionize his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) whole system.
<p/>Chapter 29   The carrying out of Levin's plan presented many difficulties; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) struggled on, doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) utmost, and attained a result which, though not what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) desired, was enough to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), without self-deception, to believe that the attempt was worth the trouble.
<p/>One of the chief difficulties was that the process of cultivating the land was in full swing, that it was impossible to stop everything and begin it all again from the beginning, and the machine had to be mended while in motion.
<p/>When on the evening that he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) arrived home he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) informed the bailiff of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) plans, the latter with visible pleasure agreed with what he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) said so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was pointing out that all that had been done up to that time was stupid and useless.
<p/>The bailiff said that he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) had said so a long while ago, but no heed had been paid him (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>).
<p/>But as for the proposal made by Levin--to take a part as shareholder with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) laborers in each agricultural undertaking-- at this the bailiff simply expressed a profound despondency, and offered no definite opinion, but began immediately talking of the urgent necessity of carrying the remaining sheaves of rye the next day, and of sending the men out for the second ploughing, so that Levin felt that this was not the time for discussing it.
<p/>On beginning to talk to the peasants about it, and making a proposition to cede them the land on new terms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) came into collision with the same great difficulty that they were so much absorbed by the current work of the day, that they had not time to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed scheme.
<p/>The simple-hearted Ivan, the cowherd, seemed completely to grasp Levin's proposal--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) should with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) family take a share of the profits of the cattle-yard--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was in complete sympathy with the plan.
<p/>But when Levin hinted at the future advantages, Ivan's face expressed alarm and regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not hear all he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to say, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) made haste to find himself some task that would admit of no delay: he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) either snatched up the fork to pitch the hay out of the pens, or ran to get water or to clear out the dung.
<p/>Another difficulty lay in the invincible disbelief of the peasant that a landowner's object could be anything else than a desire to squeeze all he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) could out of them.
<p/>They were firmly convinced that his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) real aim -LRB-whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) might say to them-RRB- would always be in what he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) did not say to them.
<p/>And they themselves, in giving their opinion, said a great deal but never said what was their real object.
<p/>Moreover -LRB-Levin felt that the irascible landowner had been right-RRB- the peasants made their first and unalterable condition of any agreement whatever that they should not be forced to any new methods of tillage of any kind, nor to use new implements.
<p/>They agreed that the modern plough ploughed better, that the scarifier did the work more quickly, but they found thousands of reasons that made it out of the question for them to use either of them; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had accepted the conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would have to lower the standard of cultivation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt sorry to give up improved methods, the advantages of which were so obvious.
<p/>But in spite of all these difficulties he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) way, and by autumn the system was working, or at least so it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>At first Levin had thought of giving up the whole farming of the land just as it was to the peasants, the laborers, and the bailiff on new conditions of partnership; but he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) was very soon convinced that this was impossible, and determined to divide it up.
<p/>The cattle-yard, the garden, hay fields, and arable land, divided into several parts, had to be made into separate lots.
<p/>The simple-hearted cowherd, Ivan, who, Levin fancied, understood the matter better than any of them, collecting together a gang of workers to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), principally of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own family, became a partner in the cattle-yard.
<p/>A distant part of the estate, a tract of waste land that had lain fallow for eight years, was with the help of the clever carpenter, Fyodor Ryezunov, taken by six families of peasants on new conditions of partnership, and the peasant Shuraev took the management of all the vegetable gardens on the same terms.
<p/>The remainder of the land was still worked on the old system, but these three associated partnerships were the first step to a new organization of the whole, and they completely took up Levin's time.
<p/>It is true that in the cattle-yard things went no better than before, and Ivan strenuously opposed warm housing for the cows and butter made of fresh cream, affirming that cows require less food if kept cold, and that butter is more profitable made from sour cream, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) asked for wages just as under the old system, and took not the slightest interest in the fact that the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) received was not wages but an advance out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) future share in the profits.
<p/>It is true that Fyodor Ryezunov's company did not plough over the ground twice before sowing, as had been agreed, justifying themselves on the plea that the time was too short.
<p/>It is true that the peasants of the same company, though they had agreed to work the land on new conditions, always spoke of the land, not as held in partnership, but as rented for half the crop, and more than once the peasants and Ryezunov himself said to Levin, <div class="bookquote">``If you would take a rent for the land, it would save you trouble, and we should be more free.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Moreover the same peasants kept putting off, on various excuses, the building of a cattleyard and barn on the land as agreed upon, and delayed doing it till the winter.
<p/>It is true that Shuraev would have liked to let out the kitchen gardens he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had undertaken in small lots to the peasants.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) evidently quite misunderstood, and apparently intentionally misunderstood, the conditions upon which the land had been given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Often, too, talking to the peasants and explaining to them all the advantages of the plan, Levin felt that the peasants heard nothing but the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) voice, and were firmly resolved, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) might say, not to let themselves be taken in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt this especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) talked to the cleverest of the peasants, Ryezunov, and detected the gleam in Ryezunov's eyes which showed so plainly both ironical amusement at Levin, and the firm conviction that, if any one were to be taken in, it would not be he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), Ryezunov.
<p/>But in spite of all this Levin thought the system worked, and that by keeping accounts strictly and insisting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would prove to them in the future the advantages of the arrangement, and then the system would go of itself.
<p/>These matters, together with the management of the land still left on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands, and the indoor work over his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) book, so engrossed Levin the whole summer that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scarcely ever went out shooting.
<p/>At the end of August he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard that the Oblonskys had gone away to Moscow, from their servant who brought back the side-saddle.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) felt that in not answering Darya Alexandrovna's letter he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had by his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) rudeness, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) could not think without a flush of shame, burned his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) ships, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would never go and see them again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had been just as rude with the Sviazhskys, leaving them without saying good-bye.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would never go to see them again either.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) did not care about that now.
<p/>The business of reorganizing the farming of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) land absorbed him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) as completely as though there would never be anything else in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) read the books lent him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) by Sviazhsky, and copying out what he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had not got, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) read both the economic and socialistic books on the subject, but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had anticipated, found nothing bearing on the scheme he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had undertaken.
<p/>In the books on political economy--in Mill, for instance, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) studied first with great ardor, hoping every minute to find an answer to the questions that were engrossing him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) found laws deduced from the condition of land culture in Europe; but he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) did not see why these laws, which did not apply in Russia, must be general.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) saw just the same thing in the socialistic books: either they were the beautiful but impracticable fantasies which had fascinated him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was a student, or they were attempts at improving, rectifying the economic position in which Europe was placed, with which the system of land tenure in Russia had nothing in common.
<p/>Political economy told him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) that the laws by which the wealth of Europe had been developed, and was developing, were universal and unvarying.
<p/>Socialism told him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) that development along these lines leads to ruin.
<p/>And neither of them gave an answer, or even a hint, in reply to the question what he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), Levin, and all the Russian peasants and landowners, were to do with their millions of hands and millions of acres, to make them as productive as possible for the common weal.
<p/>Having once taken the subject up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) read conscientiously everything bearing on it, and intended in the autumn to go abroad to study land systems on the spot, in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) might not on this question be confronted with what so often met him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) on various subjects.
<p/>Often, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was beginning to understand the idea in the mind of anyone he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was talking to, and was beginning to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would suddenly be told: <div class="bookquote">``But Kauffmann, but Jones, but Dubois, but Michelli?
<p/>You haven't read them: they've thrashed that question out thoroughly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dubois</b></font>) saw now distinctly that Kauffmann and Michelli had nothing to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dubois</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dubois</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dubois</b></font>) wanted.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dubois</b></font>) saw that Russia has splendid land, splendid laborers, and that in certain cases, as at the peasant's on the way to Sviazhsky's, the produce raised by the laborers and the land is great--in the majority of cases when capital is applied in the European way the produce is small, and that this simply arises from the fact that the laborers want to work and work well only in their own peculiar way, and that this antagonism is not incidental but invariable, and has its roots in the national spirit.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) thought that the Russian people whose task it was to colonize and cultivate vast tracts of unoccupied land, consciously adhered, till all their land was occupied, to the methods suitable to their purpose, and that their methods were by no means so bad as was generally supposed.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) wanted to prove this theoretically in his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) book and practically on his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) land.
<p/>Chapter 30   At the end of September the timber had been carted for building the cattleyard on the land that had been allotted to the association of peasants, and the butter from the cows was sold and the profits divided.
<p/>In practice the system worked capitally, or, at least, so it seemed to Levin.
<p/>In order to work out the whole subject theoretically and to complete his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) book, which, in Levin's daydreams, was not merely to effect a revolution in political economy, but to annihilate that science entirely and to lay the foundation of a new science of the relation of the people to the soil, all that was left to do was to make a tour abroad, and to study on the spot all that had been done in the same direction, and to collect conclusive evidence that all that had been done there was not what was wanted.
<p/>Levin was only waiting for the delivery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wheat to receive the money for it and go abroad.
<p/>But the rains began, preventing the harvesting of the corn and potatoes left in the fields, and putting a stop to all work, even to the delivery of the wheat.
<p/>The mud was impassable along the roads; two mills were carried away, and the weather got worse and worse.
<p/>On the 30th of September the sun came out in the morning, and hoping for fine weather, Levin began making final preparations for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) journey.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gave orders for the wheat to be delivered, sent the bailiff to the merchant to get the money owing him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>), and went out himself to give some final directions on the estate before setting off.
<p/>Having finished all his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) business, soaked through with the streams of water which kept running down the leather behind his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) neck and his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) gaiters, but in the keenest and most confident temper, Levin returned homewards in the evening.
<p/>The weather had become worse than ever towards evening; the hail lashed the drenched mare so cruelly that she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) went along sideways, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) head and ears; but Levin was all right under his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hood, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looked cheerfully about him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) at the muddy streams running under the wheels, at the drops hanging on every bare twig, at the whiteness of the patch of unmelted hailstones on the planks of the bridge, at the thick layer of still juicy, fleshy leaves that lay heaped up about the stripped elm-tree.
<p/>In spite of the gloominess of nature around him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt peculiarly eager.
<p/>The talks he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been having with the peasants in the further village had shown that they were beginning to get used to their new position.
<p/>The old servant to whose hut he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had gone to get dry evidently approved of Levin's plan, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own accord proposed to enter the partnership by the purchase of cattle.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have only to go stubbornly on towards my aim, and I shall attain my end,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>thought Levin; <div class="bookquote">``and it's something to work and take trouble for.
<p/>This is not a matter of myself individually; the question of the public welfare comes into it.
<p/>The whole system of culture, the chief element in the condition of the people, must be completely transformed.
<p/>Instead of poverty, general prosperity and content; instead of hostility, harmony and unity of interests.
<p/>In short, a bloodless revolution, but a revolution of the greatest magnitude, beginning in the little circle of our district, then the province, then Russia, the whole world.
<p/>Because a just idea cannot but be fruitful.
<p/>Yes, it's an aim worth working for.
<p/>And its being me, Kostya Levin, who went to a ball in a black tie, and was refused by the Shtcherbatskaya girl, and who was intrinsically such a pitiful, worthless creature--that proves nothing; I feel sure Franklin felt just as worthless, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) too had no faith in himself, thinking of himself as a whole.
<p/>That means nothing.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) too, most likely, had an Agafea Mihalovna to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) confided his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) secrets.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Musing on such thoughts Levin reached home in the darkness.
<p/>The bailiff, who had been to the merchant, had come back and brought part of the money for the wheat.
<p/>An agreement had been made with the old servant, and on the road the bailiff had learned that everywhere the corn was still standing in the fields, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) one hundred and sixty shocks that had not been carried were nothing in comparison with the losses of others.
<p/>After dinner Levin was sitting, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) usually did, in an easy chair with a book, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) read he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went on thinking of the journey before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in connection with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) book.
<p/>Today all the significance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) book rose before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with special distinctness, and whole periods ranged themselves in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind in illustration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) theories.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must write that down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That ought to form a brief introduction, which I thought unnecessary before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) got up to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) writing table, and Laska, lying at his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) feet, got up too, stretching and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) as though to inquire where to go.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) had not time to write it down, for the head peasants had come round, and Levin went out into the hall to them.
<p/>After his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) levee, that is to say, giving directions about the labors of the next day, and seeing all the peasants who had business with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), Levin went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) study and sat down to work.
<p/>Laska lay under the table; Agafea Mihalovna settled herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>peasants</b></font>) place with her (<font color='blue'><b>peasants</b></font>) stocking.
<p/>After writing for a little while, Levin suddenly thought with exceptional vividness of Kitty, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) refusal, and their last meeting.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) got up and began walking about the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the use of being dreary?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Agafea Mihalovna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Agafea Mihalovna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, why do you stay on at home?
<p/>You ought to go to some warm springs, especially now you're ready for the journey.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am going away the day after tomorrow, Agafea Mihalovna; I must finish my work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, there, your work, you say!
<p/>As if you hadn't done enough for the peasants!
<p/>Why, as 'tis, they're saying, `Your master will be getting some honor from the Tsar for it.'
<p/>Indeed and it is a strange thing; why need you worry about the peasants?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not worrying about them; I'm doing it for my own good.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Agafea Mihalovna</b></font>)</div><p/>Agafea Mihalovna knew every detail of Levin's plans for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) land.
<p/>Levin often put his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) views before her (<font color='blue'><b>peasants</b></font>) in all their complexity, and not uncommonly he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) argued with her (<font color='blue'><b>peasants</b></font>) and did not agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>peasants</b></font>) comments.
<p/>But on this occasion she (<font color='blue'><b>peasants</b></font>) entirely misinterpreted what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of one's soul's salvation we all know and must think before all else,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>peasants</b></font>) said with a sigh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Parfen Denisitch now, for all he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was no scholar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) died a death that God grant every one of us the like,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>peasants</b></font>) said, referring to a servant who had died recently.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Took the sacrament and all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not what I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that I'm acting for my own advantage.
<p/>It's all the better for me if the peasants do their work better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, whatever you do, if he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)'s a lazy good-for-nought, everything'll be at sixes and sevens.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) has a conscience, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)'ll work, and if not, there's no doing anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come, you say yourself Ivan has begun looking after the cattle better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All I say is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Agafea Mihalovna</b></font>)</div>answered Agafea Mihalovna, evidently not speaking at random, but in strict sequence of idea, <div class="bookquote">``that you ought to get married, that's what I say.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Agafea Mihalovna</b></font>)</div><p/>Agafea Mihalovna's allusion to the very subject he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had only just been thinking about, hurt and stung him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>Levin scowled, and without answering her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sat down again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) work, repeating to himself all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been thinking of the real significance of that work.
<p/>Only at intervals he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) listened in the stillness to the click of Agafea Mihalovna's needles, and recollecting what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not want to remember, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) frowned again.
<p/>At nine o'clock they heard the bell and the faint vibration of a carriage over the mud.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, here's visitors come to us, and you won't be dull,''  (<font color='red'><b>Agafea Mihalovna</b></font>)</div>said Agafea Mihalovna, getting up and going to the door.
<p/>But Levin overtook her (<font color='blue'><b>Mihalovna</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) work was not going well now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was glad of a visitor, whoever it might be.
<p/>Chapter 31   Running halfway down the staircase, Levin caught a sound he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew, a familiar cough in the hall.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard it indistinctly through the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own footsteps, and hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was mistaken.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) caught sight of a long, bony, familiar figure, and now it seemed there was no possibility of mistake; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) still went on hoping that this tall man taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fur cloak and coughing was not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother Nikolay.
<p/>Levin loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, but being with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was always a torture.
<p/>Just now, when Levin, under the influence of the thoughts that had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and Agafea Mihalovna's hint, was in a troubled and uncertain humor, the meeting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to face seemed particularly difficult.
<p/>Instead of a lively, healthy visitor, some outsider who would, he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) hoped, cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) up in his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) uncertain humor, he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) had to see his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) brother, who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) through and through, who would call forth all the thoughts nearest his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) heart, would force him (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) to show himself fully.
<p/>And that he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) was not disposed to do.
<p/>Angry with himself for so base a feeling, Levin ran into the hall; as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother close, this feeling of selfish disappointment vanished instantly and was replaced by pity.
<p/>Terrible as his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother Nikolay had been before in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) emaciation and sickliness, now he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) looked still more emaciated, still more wasted.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) was a skeleton covered with skin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) stood in the hall, jerking his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) long thin neck, and pulling the scarf off it, and smiled a strange and pitiful smile.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) saw that smile, submissive and humble, Levin felt something clutching at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) throat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, I've come to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Nikolay in a thick voice, never for one second taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) eyes off his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) brother's face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been meaning to a long while, but I've been unwell all the time.
<p/>Now I'm ever so much better,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) said, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) beard with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) big thin hands.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>answered Levin.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt still more frightened when, kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lips the dryness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's skin and saw close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) big eyes, full of a strange light.
<p/>A few weeks before, Konstantin Levin had written to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother that through the sale of the small part of the property, that had remained undivided, there was a sum of about two thousand roubles to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) share.
<p/>Nikolay said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) had come now to take this money and, what was more important, to stay a while in the old nest, to get in touch with the earth, so as to renew his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) strength like the heroes of old for the work that lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>).
<p/>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) exaggerated stoop, and the emaciation that was so striking from his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) height, his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) movements were as rapid and abrupt as ever.
<p/>Levin led him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) study.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother dressed with particular care--a thing he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) never used to do--combed his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) scanty, lank hair, and, smiling, went upstairs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was in the most affectionate and good-humored mood, just as Levin often remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in childhood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) even referred to Sergey Ivanovitch without rancor.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw Agafea Mihalovna, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) made jokes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and asked after the old servants.
<p/>The news of the death of Parfen Denisitch made a painful impression on him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>A look of fear crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) serenity immediately.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was quite old,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, and changed the subject.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll spend a month or two with you, and then I'm off to Moscow.
<p/>Do you know, Myakov has promised me a place there, and I'm going into the service.
<p/>Now I'm going to arrange my life quite differently,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I got rid of that woman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marya Nikolaevna?
<p/>Why, what for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) was a horrid woman!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) caused me all sorts of worries.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not say what the annoyances were.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had cast off Marya Nikolaevna because the tea was weak, and, above all, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) would look after him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) were an invalid.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides, I want to turn over a new leaf completely now.
<p/>I've done silly things, of course, like everyone else, but money's the last consideration; I don't regret it.
<p/>So long as there's health, and my health, thank God, is quite restored.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin listened and racked his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brains, but could think of nothing to say.
<p/>Nikolay probably felt the same; he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) began questioning his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) brother about his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) affairs; and Levin was glad to talk about himself, because then he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could speak without hypocrisy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) plans and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) doings.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother listened, but evidently he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not interested by it.
<p/>These two men were so akin, so near each other, that the slightest gesture, the tone of voice, told both more than could be said in words.
<p/>Both of them now had only one thought--the illness of Nikolay and the nearness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) death--which stifled all else.
<p/>But neither of them dared to speak of it, and so whatever they said-- not uttering the one thought that filled their minds--was all falsehood.
<p/>Never had Levin been so glad when the evening was over and it was time to go to bed.
<p/>Never with any outside person, never on any official visit had he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) been so unnatural and false as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was that evening.
<p/>And the consciousness of this unnaturalness, and the remorse he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt at it, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) even more unnatural.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wanted to weep over his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dying, dearly loved brother, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to listen and keep on talking of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) meant to live.
<p/>As the house was damp, and only one bedroom had been kept heated, Levin put his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother to sleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own bedroom behind a screen.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother got into bed, and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) slept or did not sleep, tossed about like a sick man, coughed, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not get his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat clear, mumbled something.
<p/>Sometimes when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breathing was painful, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my God!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sometimes when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was choking he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) muttered angrily, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, the devil!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin could not sleep for a long while, hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thoughts were of the most various, but the end of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thoughts was the same-- death.
<p/>Death, the inevitable end of all, for the first time presented itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with irresistible force.
<p/>And death, which was here in this loved brother, groaning half asleep and from habit calling without distinction on God and the devil, was not so remote as it had hitherto seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>).
<p/>It was in himself too, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) felt that.
<p/>If not today, tomorrow, if not tomorrow, in thirty years, wasn't it all the same!
<p/>And what was this inevitable death--he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) did not know, had never thought about it, and what was more, had not the power, had not the courage to think about it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I work, I want to do something, but I had forgotten it must all end; I had forgotten--death.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) bed in the darkness, crouched up, hugging his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) knees, and holding his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) breath from the strain of thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) pondered.
<p/>But the more intensely he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) thought, the clearer it became to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) that it was indubitably so, that in reality, looking upon life, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had forgotten one little fact--that death will come, and all ends; that nothing was even worth beginning, and that there was no helping it anyway.
<p/>Yes, it was awful, but it was so.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am alive still.
<p/>Now what's to be done?
<p/>what's to be done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) said in despair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) lighted a candle, got up cautiously and went to the looking-glass, and began looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) face and hair.
<p/>Yes, there were gray hairs about his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) temples.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) back teeth were beginning to decay.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) bared his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) muscular arms.
<p/>Yes, there was strength in them.
<p/>But Nikolay, who lay there breathing with what was left of lungs, had had a strong, healthy body too.
<p/>And suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) recalled how they used to go to bed together as children, and how they only waited till Fyodor Bogdanitch was out of the room to fling pillows at each other and laugh, laugh irrepressibly, so that even their awe of Fyodor Bogdanitch could not check the effervescing, overbrimming sense of life and happiness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now that bent, hollow chest...and I, not knowing what will become of me, or wherefore...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``K...ha!
<p/>K...ha!
<p/>Damnation!
<p/>Why do you keep fidgeting, why don't you go to sleep?''
 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Bogdanitch</b></font>) brother's voice called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bogdanitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know, I'm not sleepy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had a good sleep, I'm not in a sweat now.
<p/>Just see, feel my shirt; it's not wet, is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin felt, withdrew behind the screen, and put out the candle, but for a long while he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not sleep.
<p/>The question how to live had hardly begun to grow a little clearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), when a new, insoluble question presented itself--death.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s dying--yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'ll die in the spring, and how help him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)?
<p/>What can I say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)?
<p/>What do I know about it?
<p/>I'd even forgotten that it was at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 32   Levin had long before made the observation that when one is uncomfortable with people from their being excessively amenable and meek, one is apt very soon after to find things intolerable from their touchiness and irritability.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) felt that this was how it would be with his (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) brother.
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) brother Nikolay's gentleness did in fact not last out for long.
<p/>The very next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) began to be irritable, and seemed doing his (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) best to find fault with his (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) brother, attacking him (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) tenderest points.
<p/>Levin felt himself to blame, and could not set things right.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that if they had both not kept up appearances, but had spoken, as it is called, from the heart--that is to say, had said only just what they were thinking and feeling--they would simply have looked into each other's faces, and Konstantin could only have said, <div class="bookquote">``You're dying, you're dying!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Konstantin Levin/Konstantin/Konstantin Dmitrievitch</b></font>)</div><p/>and Nikolay could only have answered, <div class="bookquote">``I know I'm dying, but I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>And they could have said nothing more, if they had said only what was in their hearts.
<p/>But life like that was impossible, and so Konstantin tried to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) had been trying to do all his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) life, and never could learn to do, though, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) could observe, many people knew so well how to do it, and without it there was no living at all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) tried to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) was not thinking, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) felt continually that it had a ring of falsehood, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) brother detected him (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) in it, and was exasperated at it.
<p/>The third day Nikolay induced his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) brother to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) plan to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) again, and began not merely attacking it, but intentionally confounding it with communism.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've simply borrowed an idea that's not your own, but you've distorted it, and are trying to apply it where it's not applicable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin knew this, and the tears gushed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother once more, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not speak, and knew not what to say.

<p/>Life had to be got through somehow till death did come.
<p/>Darkness had fallen upon everything for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>); but just because of this darkness he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that the one guiding clue in the darkness was his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) work, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) clutched it and clung to it with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) strength.
<p/>PART 4      Chapter 1   The Karenins, husband and wife, continued living in the same house, met every day, but were complete strangers to one another.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch made it a rule to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife every day, so that the servants might have no grounds for suppositions, but avoided dining at home.
<p/>Vronsky was never at Alexey Alexandrovitch's house, but Anna saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) away from home, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband was aware of it.
<p/>The position was one of misery for all three; and not one of them would have been equal to enduring this position for a single day, if it had not been for the expectation that it would change, that it was merely a temporary painful ordeal which would pass over.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch hoped that this passion would pass, as everything does pass, that everyone would forget about it, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) name would remain unsullied.
<p/>Anna, on whom the position depended, and for whom it was more miserable than for anyone, endured it because she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) not merely hoped, but firmly believed, that it would all very soon be settled and come right.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not the least idea what would settle the position, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) firmly believed that something would very soon turn up now.
<p/>Vronsky, against his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own will or wishes, followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lead, hoped too that something, apart from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own action, would be sure to solve all difficulties.
<p/>In the middle of the winter Vronsky spent a very tiresome week.
<p/>A foreign prince, who had come on a visit to Petersburg, was put under his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) charge, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had to show him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) the sights worth seeing.
<p/>Vronsky was of distinguished appearance; he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) possessed, moreover, the art of behaving with respectful dignity, and was used to having to do with such grand personages--that was how he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) came to be put in charge of the prince.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) duties very irksome.
<p/>The prince was anxious to miss nothing of which he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) would be asked at home, had he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) seen that in Russia?
<p/>And on his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) own account he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) was anxious to enjoy to the utmost all Russian forms of amusement.
<p/>Vronsky was obliged to be his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) guide in satisfying both these inclinations.
<p/>The mornings they spent driving to look at places of interest; the evenings they passed enjoying the national entertainments.
<p/>The prince rejoiced in health exceptional even among princes.
<p/>By gymnastics and careful attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) health he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had brought himself to such a point that in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) excess in pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) looked as fresh as a big glossy green Dutch cucumber.
<p/>The prince had traveled a great deal, and considered one of the chief advantages of modern facilities of communication was the accessibility of the pleasures of all nations.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had been in Spain, and there had indulged in serenades and had made friends with a Spanish girl who played the mandolin.
<p/>In Switzerland he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had killed chamois.
<p/>In England he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had galloped in a red coat over hedges and killed two hundred pheasants for a bet.
<p/>In Turkey he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had got into a harem; in India he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had hunted on an elephant, and now in Russia he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) wished to taste all the specially Russian forms of pleasure.
<p/>Vronsky, who was, as it were, chief master of the ceremonies to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), was at great pains to arrange all the Russian amusements suggested by various persons to the prince.
<p/>They had race horses, and Russian pancakes and bear hunts and three-horse sledges, and gypsies and drinking feasts, with the Russian accompaniment of broken crockery.
<p/>And the prince with surprising ease fell in with the Russian spirit, smashed trays full of crockery, sat with a gypsy girl on his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) knee, and seemed to be asking--what more, and does the whole Russian spirit consist in just this?
<p/>In reality, of all the Russian entertainments the prince liked best French actresses and ballet dancers and white-seal champagne.
<p/>Vronsky was used to princes, but, either because he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had himself changed of late, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) was in too close proximity to the prince, that week seemed fearfully wearisome to him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>).
<p/>The whole of that week he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) experienced a sensation such as a man might have set in charge of a dangerous madman, afraid of the madman, and at the same time, from being with him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>), fearing for his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) own reason.
<p/>Vronsky was continually conscious of the necessity of never for a second relaxing the tone of stern official respectfulness, that he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) might not himself be insulted.
<p/>The prince's manner of treating the very people who, to Vronsky's surprise, were ready to descend to any depths to provide him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) with Russian amusements, was contemptuous.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) criticisms of Russian women, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) wished to study, more than once made Vronsky crimson with indignation.
<p/>The chief reason why the prince was so particularly disagreeable to Vronsky was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) could not help seeing himself in him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>And what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) saw in this mirror did not gratify his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) self-esteem.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was a very stupid and very self-satisfied and very healthy and very well-washed man, and nothing else.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a gentleman--that was true, and Vronsky could not deny it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was equable and not cringing with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) superiors, was free and ingratiating in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) behavior with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) equals, and was contemptuously indulgent with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inferiors.
<p/>Vronsky was himself the same, and regarded it as a great merit to be so.
<p/>But for this prince he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) was an inferior, and his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) contemptuous and indulgent attitude to him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) revolted him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brainless beef!
<p/>can I be like that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) thought.
<p/>Be that as it might, when, on the seventh day, he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) parted from the prince, who was starting for Moscow, and received his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) thanks, he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) was happy to be rid of his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) uncomfortable position and the unpleasant reflection of himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) said good-bye to him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) at the station on their return from a bear hunt, at which they had had a display of Russian prowess kept up all night.
<p/>Chapter 2   When he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) got home, Vronsky found there a note from Anna.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wrote, <div class="bookquote">``I am ill and unhappy.
<p/>I cannot come out, but I cannot go on longer without seeing you.
<p/>Come in this evening.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch goes to the council at seven and will be there till ten.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Thinking for an instant of the strangeness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) come straight to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband's insisting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) not receiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) decided to go.
<p/>Vronsky had that winter got his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) promotion, was now a colonel, had left the regimental quarters, and was living alone.
<p/>After having some lunch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) lay down on the sofa immediately, and in five minutes memories of the hideous scenes he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had witnessed during the last few days were confused together and joined on to a mental image of Anna and of the peasant who had played an important part in the bear hunt, and Vronsky fell asleep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) waked up in the dark, trembling with horror, and made haste to light a candle.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was it?
<p/>What?
<p/>What was the dreadful thing I dreamed?
<p/>Yes, yes; I think a little dirty man with a disheveled beard was stooping down doing something, and all of a sudden he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began saying some strange words in French.
<p/>Yes, there was nothing else in the dream,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why was it so awful?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vividly recalled the peasant again and those incomprehensible French words the peasant had uttered, and a chill of horror ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) spine.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Vronsky, and glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) watch.
<p/>It was half-past eight already.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) rang up his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) servant, dressed in haste, and went out onto the steps, completely forgetting the dream and only worried at being late.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) drove up to the Karenins' entrance he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) watch and saw it was ten minutes to nine.
<p/>A high, narrow carriage with a pair of grays was standing at the entrance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) recognized Anna's carriage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is coming to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>thought Vronsky, <div class="bookquote">``and better she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) should.
<p/>I don't like going into that house.
<p/>But no matter; I can't hide myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) thought, and with that manner peculiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) from childhood, as of a man who has nothing to be ashamed of, Vronsky got out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) sledge and went to the door.
<p/>The door opened, and the hall porter with a rug on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) arm called the carriage.
<p/>Vronsky, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) did not usually notice details, noticed at this moment the amazed expression with which the porter glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>).
<p/>In the very doorway Vronsky almost ran up against Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>The gas jet threw its full light on the bloodless, sunken face under the black hat and on the white cravat, brilliant against the beaver of the coat.
<p/>Karenin's fixed, dull eyes were fastened upon Vronsky's face.
<p/>Vronsky bowed, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, chewing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) lips, lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hat and went on.
<p/>Vronsky saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) without looking round get into the carriage, pick up the rug and the opera-glass at the window and disappear.
<p/>Vronsky went into the hall.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brows were scowling, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes gleamed with a proud and angry light in them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a position!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would fight, would stand up for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) honor, I could act, could express my feelings; but this weakness or baseness....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) puts me in the position of playing false, which I never meant and never mean to do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky's ideas had changed since the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) conversation with Anna in the Vrede garden.
<p/>Unconsciously yielding to the weakness of Anna--who had surrendered herself up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) utterly, and simply looked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to decide her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fate, ready to submit to anything--he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had long ceased to think that their tie might end as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had thought then.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) ambitious plans had retreated into the background again, and feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had got out of that circle of activity in which everything was definite, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had given himself entirely to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) passion, and that passion was binding him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) more and more closely to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was still in the hall when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) caught the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) retreating footsteps.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), had listened for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and was now going back to the drawing room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cried, on seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and at the first sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) voice the tears came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; if things are to go on like this, the end will come much, much too soon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, dear one?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?
<p/>I've been waiting in agony for an hour, two hours...No, I won't...I can't quarrel with you.
<p/>Of course you couldn't come.
<p/>No, I won't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) two hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) shoulders, and looked a long while at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) with a profound, passionate, and at the same time searching look.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was studying his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face to make up for the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was, every time she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), making the picture of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) imagination -LRB-incomparably superior, impossible in reality-RRB- fit with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) really was.
<p/>Chapter 3   <div class="bookquote">``You met him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked, when they had sat down at the table in the lamplight.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're punished, you see, for being late.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but how was it?

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew every detail of his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) existence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) was going to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had been up all night and had dropped asleep, but looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thrilled and rapturous face, he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) was ashamed.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had had to go to report on the prince's departure.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's over now?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God it's over!

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, knitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) brows; and taking up the crochet work that was lying on the table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) began drawing the hook out of it, without looking at Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I gave that life up long ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>), wondering at the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face, and trying to divine its meaning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) said, with a smile, showing his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) thick, white teeth, <div class="bookquote">``this week I've been, as it were, looking at myself in a glass, seeing that life, and I didn't like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``what you tell me.
<p/>And how do I know whether you tell me the truth?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna, you hurt me.
<p/>Don't you trust me?
<p/>Haven't I told you that I haven't a thought I wouldn't lay bare to you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, evidently trying to suppress her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) jealous thoughts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if only you knew how wretched I am!
<p/>I believe you, I believe you....  What were you saying?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could not at once recall what he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had been going to say.
<p/>These fits of jealousy, which of late had been more and more frequent with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), horrified him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and however much he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) tried to disguise the fact, made him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) feel cold to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), although he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) knew the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) jealousy was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) love for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>How often he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had told himself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) love was happiness; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) as a woman can love when love has outweighed for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) all the good things of life--and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was much further from happiness than when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from Moscow.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had thought himself unhappy, but happiness was before him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); now he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) felt that the best happiness was already left behind.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was utterly unlike what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) first saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Both morally and physically she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had changed for the worse.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had broadened out all over, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face at the time when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was speaking of the actress there was an evil expression of hatred that distorted it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as a man looks at a faded flower he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has gathered, with difficulty recognizing in it the beauty for which he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) picked and ruined it.
<p/>And in spite of this he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) felt that then, when his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) love was stronger, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could, if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had greatly wished it, have torn that love out of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) heart; but now, when as at that moment it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) felt no love for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) knew that what bound him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not be broken.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, what was it you were going to say about the prince?
<p/>I have driven away the fiend,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added.
<p/>The fiend was the name they had given her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) jealousy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you begin to tell me about the prince?
<p/>Why did you find it so tiresome?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it was intolerable!''

(<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), pulled the hook at last out of the crochet work, and rapidly, with the help of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) forefinger, began working loop after loop of the wool that was dazzling white in the lamplight, while the slender wrist moved swiftly, nervously in the embroidered cuff.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) smiled, while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) laughed gaily, with that sweet, deep laugh, which was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) greatest charms.

<p/>The expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) face instantaneously changed.
<p/>Horror and excitement were suddenly replaced by a look of soft, solemn, blissful attention.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) could not comprehend the meaning of the change.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was listening to the stirring of the new life within her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 4   Alexey Alexandrovitch, after meeting Vronsky on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own steps, drove, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had intended, to the Italian opera.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sat through two acts there, and saw everyone he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had wanted to see.
<p/>On returning home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) carefully scrutinized the hat stand, and noticing that there was not a military overcoat there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went, as usual, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own room.
<p/>But, contrary to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) usual habit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not go to bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) walked up and down his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) study till three o'clock in the morning.
<p/>The feeling of furious anger with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife, who would not observe the proprieties and keep to the one stipulation he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had laid on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), not to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lover in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own home, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) no peace.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not complied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) request, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was bound to punish her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) threat--obtain a divorce and take away his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) son.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knew all the difficulties connected with this course, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would do it, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) must carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) threat.
<p/>Countess Lidia Ivanovna had hinted that this was the best way out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) position, and of late the obtaining of divorces had been brought to such perfection that Alexey Alexandrovitch saw a possibility of overcoming the formal difficulties.
<p/>Misfortunes never come singly, and the affairs of the reorganization of the native tribes, and of the irrigation of the lands of the Zaraisky province, had brought such official worries upon Alexey Alexandrovitch that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had been of late in a continual condition of extreme irritability.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not sleep the whole night, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) fury, growing in a sort of vast, arithmetical progression, reached its highest limits in the morning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) dressed in haste, and as though carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) cup full of wrath, and fearing to spill any over, fearing to lose with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wrath the energy necessary for the interview with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went into her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room directly he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) heard she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was up.
<p/>Anna, who had thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband so well, was amazed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) appearance when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went in to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brow was lowering, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes stared darkly before him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), avoiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes; his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) mouth was tightly and contemptuously shut.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) walk, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) gestures, in the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) voice there was a determination and firmness such as his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife had never seen in him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went into her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room, and without greeting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), walked straight up to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) writing-table, and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) keys, opened a drawer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your  lover's letters,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're not here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, shutting the drawer; but from that action he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had guessed right, and roughly pushing away her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) quickly snatched a portfolio in which he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) used to put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) most important papers.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tried to pull the portfolio away, but he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) back.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely you must feel how easy it is for you to insult me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An honest man and an honest woman may be insulted, but to tell a thief he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>)'s a thief is simply  la constatation d'un fait .''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shrieked, in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shrill voice, which pitched a note higher than usual even, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) big hands clutching her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) by the arm so violently that red marks were left from the bracelet he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was squeezing, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) forcibly sat her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) place.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Base!
<p/>If you care to use that word, what is base is to forsake husband and child for a lover, while you eat your husband's bread!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had said the evening before to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lover, that  he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)  was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband was superfluous; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not even think that.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt all the justice of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) words, and only said softly:  <div class="bookquote">``You cannot describe my position as worse than I feel it to be myself; but what are you saying all this for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I saying it for?

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went on, as angrily.

(<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch was speaking so quickly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) stammered, and was utterly unable to articulate the word <div class="bookquote">``suffering.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) pronounced it <div class="bookquote">``thuffering.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wanted to laugh, and was immediately ashamed that anything could amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) at such a moment.
<p/>And for the first time, for an instant, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) felt for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), put herself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) place, and was sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>But what could she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) say or do?
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) head sank, and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sat silent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) too was silent for some time, and then began speaking in a frigid, less shrill voice, emphasizing random words that had no special significance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came to tell you...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it was my fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) thought, recalling the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) stumbled over the word <div class="bookquote">``suffering.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; can a man with those dull eyes, with that self-satisfied complacency, feel anything?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot change anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) whispered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come to tell you that I am going tomorrow to Moscow, and shall not return again to this house, and you will receive notice of what I decide through the lawyer into whose hands I shall intrust the task of getting a divorce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You take Seryozha to hurt me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) from under her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brows.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was going away, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) detained him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexey Alexandrovitch, leave me Seryozha!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) whispered once more.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nothing else to say.

 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch flew into a rage, and, snatching his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hand from her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went out of the room without a word.
<p/>Chapter 5   The waiting-room of the celebrated Petersburg lawyer was full when Alexey Alexandrovitch entered it.
<p/>Three ladies--an old lady, a young lady, and a merchant's wife--and three gentlemen-- one a German banker with a ring on his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) finger, the second a merchant with a beard, and the third a wrathful-looking government clerk in official uniform, with a cross on his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) neck-- had obviously been waiting a long while already.
<p/>Two clerks were writing at tables with scratching pens.
<p/>The appurtenances of the writing-tables, about which Alexey Alexandrovitch was himself very fastidious, were exceptionally good.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not help observing this.
<p/>One of the clerks, without getting up, turned wrathfully to Alexey Alexandrovitch, half closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you wanting?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had to see the lawyer on some business.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) is engaged,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>the clerk responded severely, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) pointed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) pen at the persons waiting, and went on writing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) spare time to see me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) has no time free; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) is always busy.
<p/>Kindly wait your turn.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I must trouble you to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) my card,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch said with dignity, seeing the impossibility of preserving his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) incognito.
<p/>The clerk took the card and, obviously not approving of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) read on it, went to the door.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch was in principle in favor of the publicity of legal proceedings, though for some higher official considerations he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) disliked the application of the principle in Russia, and disapproved of it, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could disapprove of anything instituted by authority of the Emperor.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) whole life had been spent in administrative work, and consequently, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) did not approve of anything, his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) disapproval was softened by the recognition of the inevitability of mistakes and the possibility of reform in every department.
<p/>In the new public law courts he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) disliked the restrictions laid on the lawyers conducting cases.
<p/>But till then he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) had had nothing to do with the law courts, and so had disapproved of their publicity simply in theory; now his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) disapprobation was strengthened by the unpleasant impression made on him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) in the lawyer's waiting room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Coming immediately,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk minutes</b></font>)</div>said the clerk; and two minutes later there did actually appear in the doorway the large figure of an old solicitor who had been consulting with the lawyer himself.
<p/>The lawyer was a little, squat, bald man, with a dark, reddish beard, light-colored long eyebrows, and an overhanging brow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was attired as though for a wedding, from his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) cravat to his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) double watch-chain and varnished boots.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) face was clever and manly, but his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) dress was dandified and in bad taste.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray walk in,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch; and, gloomily ushering Karenin in before him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) closed the door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you sit down?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) indicated an armchair at a writing table covered with papers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sat down himself, and, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) little hands with short fingers covered with white hairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head on one side.
<p/>But as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was settled in this position a moth flew over the table.
<p/>The lawyer, with a swiftness that could never have been expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>), opened his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) hands, caught the moth, and resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) former attitude.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Before beginning to speak of my business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch, following the lawyer's movements with wondering eyes, <div class="bookquote">``I ought to observe that the business about which I have to speak to you is to be strictly private.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>The lawyer's overhanging reddish mustaches were parted in a scarcely perceptible smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not be a lawyer if I could not keep the secrets confided to me.
<p/>But if you would like proof...''   (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face, and saw that the shrewd, gray eyes were laughing, and seemed to know all about it already.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know my name?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch resumed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you and the good'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--again he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) caught a moth--<div class="bookquote">``work you are doing, like every Russian,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer, bowing.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed, plucking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) courage.
<p/>But having once made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went on in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) shrill voice, without timidity--or hesitation, accentuating here and there a word.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have the misfortune,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch began, <div class="bookquote">``to have been deceived in my married life, and I desire to break off all relations with my wife by legal means--that is, to be divorced, but to do this so that my son may not remain with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>The lawyer's gray eyes tried not to laugh, but they were dancing with irrepressible glee, and Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that it was not simply the delight of a man who has just got a profitable job: there was triumph and joy, there was a gleam like the malignant gleam he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife's eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You desire my assistance in securing a divorce?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, precisely so; but I ought to warn you that I may be wasting your time and attention.
<p/>I have come simply to consult you as a preliminary step.
<p/>I want a divorce, but the form in which it is possible is of great consequence to me.
<p/>It is very possible that if that form does not correspond with my requirements I may give up a legal divorce.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's always the case,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer, <div class="bookquote">``and that's always for you to decide.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) eyes rest on Alexey Alexandrovitch's feet, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) might offend his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) client by the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) irrepressible amusement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) looked at a moth that flew before his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) nose, and moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hands, but did not catch it from regard for Alexey Alexandrovitch's position.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Though in their general features our laws on this subject are known to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>pursued Alexey Alexandrovitch, <div class="bookquote">``I should be glad to have an idea of the forms in which such things are done in practice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would be glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>the lawyer, without lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) eyes, responded, adopting, with a certain satisfaction, the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) client's remarks, <div class="bookquote">``for me to lay before you all the methods by which you could secure what you desire?''
 (<font color='red'><b>client</b></font>)</div><p/>And on receiving an assuring nod from Alexey Alexandrovitch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went on, stealing a glance now and then at Alexey Alexandrovitch's face, which was growing red in patches.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Divorce by our laws,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, with a slight shade of disapprobation of our laws, <div class="bookquote">``is possible, as you are aware, in the following cases....
<p/>Wait a little!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) called to a clerk who put his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head in at the door, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) got up all the same, said a few words to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and sat down again.
<p/>''...In the following cases: physical defect in the married parties, desertion without communication for five years,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, crooking a short finger covered with hair, <div class="bookquote">``adultery''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-this word he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) pronounced with obvious satisfaction-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``subdivided as follows''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) continued to crook his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) fat fingers, though the three cases and their subdivisions could obviously not be classified together-RRB-: <div class="bookquote">``physical defect of the husband or of the wife, adultery of the husband or of the wife.''
 (<font color='red'><b>crook fingers</b></font>)</div><p/>As by now all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fingers were used up, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) uncrooked all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fingers and went on: <div class="bookquote">``This is the theoretical view; but I imagine you have done me the honor to apply to me in order to learn its application in practice.
<p/>And therefore, guided by precedents, I must inform you that in practice cases of divorce may all be reduced to the following-- there's no physical defect, I may assume, nor desertion?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head in assent.  ''
<p/>--May be reduced to the following: adultery of one of the married parties, and the detection in the fact of the guilty party by mutual agreement, and failing such agreement, accidental detection.
<p/>It must be admitted that the latter case is rarely met with in practice,'' said the lawyer, and stealing a glance at Alexey Alexandrovitch he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) paused, as a man selling pistols, after enlarging on the advantages of each weapon, might await his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) customer's choice.
<p/>But Alexey Alexandrovitch said nothing, and therefore the lawyer went on: <div class="bookquote">``The most usual and simple, the sensible course, I consider, is adultery by mutual consent.
<p/>I should not permit myself to express it so, speaking with a man of no education,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but I imagine that to you this is comprehensible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch was, however, so perturbed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not immediately comprehend all the good sense of adultery by mutual consent, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes expressed this uncertainty; but the lawyer promptly came to his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) assistance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``People cannot go on living together--here you have a fact.
<p/>And if both are agreed about it, the details and formalities become a matter of no importance.
<p/>And at the same time this is the simplest and most certain method.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch fully understood now.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had religious scruples, which hindered the execution of such a plan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is out of the question in the present case,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only one alternative is possible: undesigned detection, supported by letters which I have.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>At the mention of letters the lawyer pursed up his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) lips, and gave utterance to a thin little compassionate and contemptuous sound.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kindly consider,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``cases of that kind are, as you are aware, under ecclesiastical jurisdiction; the reverend fathers are fond of going into the minutest details in cases of that kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) said with a smile, which betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) sympathy with the reverend fathers' taste.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Letters may, of course, be a partial confirmation; but detection in the fact there must be of the most direct kind, that is, by eyewitnesses.
<p/>In fact, if you do me the honor to intrust your confidence to me, you will do well to leave me the choice of the measures to be employed.
<p/>If one wants the result, one must admit the means.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is so...''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch began, suddenly turning white; but at that moment the lawyer rose and again went to the door to speak to the intruding clerk.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) we don't haggle over fees!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) said, and returned to Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) way back he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) caught unobserved another moth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nice state my rep curtains will be in by the summer!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) thought, frowning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you were saying?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will communicate my decision to you by letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch, getting up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) clutched at the table.
<p/>After standing a moment in silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``From your words I may consequently conclude that a divorce may be obtained?
<p/>I would ask you to let me know what are your terms.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be obtained if you give me complete liberty of action,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer, not answering his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When can I reckon on receiving information from you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) asked, moving towards the door, his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) varnished boots shining.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a week's time.
<p/>Your answer as to whether you will undertake to conduct the case, and on what terms, you will be so good as to communicate to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>The lawyer bowed respectfully, let his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) client out of the door, and, left alone, gave himself up to his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) sense of amusement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) felt so mirthful that, contrary to his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) rules, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) made a reduction in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) terms to the haggling lady, and gave up catching moths, finally deciding that next winter he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) must have the furniture covered with velvet, like Sigonin's.
<p/>Chapter 6   Alexey Alexandrovitch had gained a brilliant victory at the sitting of the Commission of the 17th of August, but in the sequel this victory cut the ground from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) feet.
<p/>The new commission for the inquiry into the condition of the native tribes in all its branches had been formed and despatched to its destination with an unusual speed and energy inspired by Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>Within three months a report was presented.
<p/>The condition of the native tribes was investigated in its political, administrative, economic, ethnographic, material, and religious aspects.
<p/>To all these questions there were answers admirably stated, and answers admitting no shade of doubt, since they were not a product of human thought, always liable to error, but were all the product of official activity.
<p/>The answers were all based on official data furnished by governors and heads of churches, and founded on the reports of district magistrates and ecclesiastical superintendents, founded in their turn on the reports of parochial overseers and parish priests; and so all of these answers were unhesitating and certain.
<p/>All such questions as, for instance, of the cause of failure of crops, of the adherence of certain tribes to their ancient beliefs, etc.-- questions which, but for the convenient intervention of the official machine, are not, and cannot be solved for ages-- received full, unhesitating solution.
<p/>And this solution was in favor of Alexey Alexandrovitch's contention.
<p/>But Stremov, who had felt stung to the quick at the last sitting, had, on the reception of the commission's report, resorted to tactics which Alexey Alexandrovitch had not anticipated.
<p/>Stremov, carrying with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) several members, went over to Alexey Alexandrovitch's side, and not contenting himself with warmly defending the measure proposed by Karenin, proposed other more extreme measures in the same direction.
<p/>These measures, still further exaggerated in opposition to what was Alexey Alexandrovitch's fundamental idea, were passed by the commission, and then the aim of Stremov's tactics became apparent.
<p/>Carried to an extreme, the measures seemed at once to be so absurd that the highest authorities, and public opinion, and intellectual ladies, and the newspapers, all at the same time fell foul of them, expressing their indignation both with the measures and their nominal father, Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>Stremov drew back, affecting to have blindly followed Karenin, and to be astounded and distressed at what had been done.
<p/>This meant the defeat of Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>But in spite of failing health, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) domestic griefs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not give in.
<p/>There was a split in the commission.
<p/>Some members, with Stremov at their head, justified their mistake on the ground that they had put faith in the commission of revision, instituted by Alexey Alexandrovitch, and maintained that the report of the commission was rubbish, and simply so much waste paper.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch, with a following of those who saw the danger of so revolutionary an attitude to official documents, persisted in upholding the statements obtained by the revising commission.
<p/>In consequence of this, in the higher spheres, and even in society, all was chaos, and although everyone was interested, no one could tell whether the native tribes really were becoming impoverished and ruined, or whether they were in a flourishing condition.
<p/>The position of Alexey Alexandrovitch, owing to this, and partly owing to the contempt lavished on him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife's infidelity, became very precarious.
<p/>And in this position he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) took an important resolution.
<p/>To the astonishment of the commission, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) should ask permission to go himself to investigate the question on the spot.
<p/>And having obtained permission, Alexey Alexandrovitch prepared to set off to these remote provinces.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch's departure made a great sensation, the more so as just before he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) started he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) officially returned the posting-fares allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) for twelve horses, to drive to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) destination.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it very noble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>Betsy said about this to the Princess Myakaya.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why take money for posting-horses when everyone knows that there are railways everywhere now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>But Princess Myakaya did not agree, and the Princess Tverskaya's opinion annoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) indeed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all very well for you to talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``when you have I don't know how many millions; but I am very glad when my husband goes on a revising tour in the summer.
<p/>It's very good for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and pleasant traveling about, and it's a settled arrangement for me to keep a carriage and coachman on the money.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) way to the remote provinces Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped for three days at Moscow.
<p/>The day after his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) arrival he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was driving back from calling on the governor-general.
<p/>At the crossroads by Gazetoy Place, where there are always crowds of carriages and sledges, Alexey Alexandrovitch suddenly heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) name called out in such a loud and cheerful voice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not help looking round.
<p/>At the corner of the pavement, in a short, stylish overcoat and a low-crowned fashionable hat, jauntily askew, with a smile that showed a gleam of white teeth and red lips, stood Stepan Arkadyevitch, radiant, young, and beaming.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) vigorously and urgently, and insisted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) stopping.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had one arm on the window of a carriage that was stopping at the corner, and out of the window were thrust the heads of a lady in a velvet hat, and two children.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch was smiling and beckoning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brother-in-law.
<p/>The lady smiled a kindly smile too, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) too waved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand to Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>It was Dolly with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) children.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch did not want to see anyone in Moscow, and least of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife's brother.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hat and would have driven on, but Stepan Arkadyevitch told his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) coachman to stop, and ran across the snow to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what a shame not to have let us know!
<p/>Been here long?
<p/>I was at Dussot's yesterday and saw `Karenin' on the visitors' list, but it never entered my head that it was you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, sticking his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) head in at the window of the carriage, <div class="bookquote">``or I should have looked you up.
<p/>I am glad to see you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) said, knocking one foot against the other to shake the snow off.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a shame of you not to let us know!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) repeated.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had no time; I am very busy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch responded dryly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come to my wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) does so want to see you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch unfolded the rug in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) frozen feet were wrapped, and getting out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) carriage made his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) way over the snow to Darya Alexandrovna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Alexey Alexandrovitch, what are you cutting us like this for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dolly, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was very busy.
<p/>Delighted to see you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said in a tone clearly indicating that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was annoyed by it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, how is my darling Anna?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch mumbled something and would have gone on.
<p/>But Stepan Arkadyevitch stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you what we'll do tomorrow.
<p/>Dolly, ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to dinner.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, please, do come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly; <div class="bookquote">``we will expect you at five, or six o'clock, if you like.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Delighted!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) moved away towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) carriage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly called after him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch said something which Dolly could not catch in the noise of the moving carriages.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall come round tomorrow!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch shouted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch got into his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) carriage, and buried himself in it so as neither to see nor be seen.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Queer fish!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife, and glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) watch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) made a motion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hand before his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face, indicating a caress to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife and children, and walked jauntily along the pavement.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stiva!
<p/>Stiva!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly called, reddening.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) turned round.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must get coats, you know, for Grisha and Tanya.
<p/>Give me the money.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind; you tell them I'll pay the bill!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) vanished, nodding genially to an acquaintance who drove by.
<p/>Chapter 7   The next day was Sunday.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch went to the Grand Theater to a rehearsal of the ballet, and gave Masha Tchibisova, a pretty dancing-girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had just taken under his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) protection, the coral necklace he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Tchibisova</b></font>) the evening before, and behind the scenes in the dim daylight of the theater, managed to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Tchibisova</b></font>) pretty little face, radiant over her (<font color='blue'><b>Tchibisova</b></font>) present.
<p/>Besides the gift of the necklace he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wanted to arrange with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tchibisova</b></font>) about meeting after the ballet.
<p/>After explaining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not come at the beginning of the ballet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) promised he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would come for the last act and take her (<font color='blue'><b>Tchibisova</b></font>) to supper.
<p/>From the theater Stepan Arkadyevitch drove to Ohotny Row, selected himself the fish and asparagus for dinner, and by twelve o'clock was at Dussot's, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had to see three people, luckily all staying at the same hotel: Levin, who had recently come back from abroad and was staying there; the new head of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) department, who had just been promoted to that position, and had come on a tour of revision to Moscow; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother-in-law, Karenin, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must see, so as to be sure of bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to dinner.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch liked dining, but still better he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) liked to give a dinner, small, but very choice, both as regards the food and drink and as regards the selection of guests.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) particularly liked the program of that day's dinner.
<p/>There would be fresh perch, asparagus, and  la pi√®ce de resistance -- first-rate, but quite plain, roast beef, and wines to suit: so much for the eating and drinking.
<p/>Kitty and Levin would be of the party, and that this might not be obtrusively evident, there would be a girl cousin too, and young Shtcherbatsky, and  la pi√®ce de resistance  among the guests--Sergey Koznishev and Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch was a Moscow man, and a philosopher; Alexey Alexandrovitch a Petersburger, and a practical politician.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was asking, too, the well-known eccentric enthusiast, Pestsov, a liberal, a great talker, a musician, an historian, and the most delightfully youthful person of fifty, who would be a sauce or garnish for Koznishev and Karenin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) would provoke them and set them off.
<p/>The second installment for the forest had been received from the merchant and was not yet exhausted; Dolly had been very amiable and goodhumored of late, and the idea of the dinner pleased Stepan Arkadyevitch from every point of view.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) was in the most light-hearted mood.
<p/>There were two circumstances a little unpleasant, but these two circumstances were drowned in the sea of good-humored gaiety which flooded the soul of Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>These two circumstances were: first, that on meeting Alexey Alexandrovitch the day before in the street he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was cold and reserved with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and putting the expression of Alexey Alexandrovitch's face and the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had not come to see them or let them know of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) arrival with the rumors he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had heard about Anna and Vronsky, Stepan Arkadyevitch guessed that something was wrong between the husband and wife.
<p/>That was one disagreeable thing.
<p/>The other slightly disagreeable fact was that the new head of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) department, like all new heads, had the reputation already of a terrible person, who got up at six o'clock in the morning, worked like a horse, and insisted on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) subordinates working in the same way.
<p/>Moreover, this new head had the further reputation of being a bear in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) manners, and was, according to all reports, a man of a class in all respects the opposite of that to which his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) predecessor had belonged, and to which Stepan Arkadyevitch had hitherto belonged himself.
<p/>On the previous day Stepan Arkadyevitch had appeared at the office in a uniform, and the new chief had been very affable and had talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) as to an acquaintance.
<p/>Consequently Stepan Arkadyevitch deemed it his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) duty to call upon him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) non-official dress.
<p/>The thought that the new chief might not tender him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) a warm reception was the other unpleasant thing.
<p/>But Stepan Arkadyevitch instinctively felt that everything would  come round  all right.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're all people, all men, like us poor sinners; why be nasty and quarrelsome?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) thought as he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) went into the hotel.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-day, Vassily,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) said, walking into the corridor with his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) hat cocked on one side, and addressing a footman he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) knew; <div class="bookquote">``why, you've let your whiskers grow!
<p/>Levin, number seven, eh?
<p/>Take me up, please.
<p/>And find out whether Count Anitchkin''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-this was the new head-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``is receiving.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vassily/Vassily Fedorovitch</b></font>)</div>Vassily responded, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've not been to see us for a long while.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was here yesterday, but at the other entrance.
<p/>Is this number seven?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin was standing with a peasant from Tver in the middle of the room, measuring a fresh bearskin, when Stepan Arkadyevitch went in.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!
<p/>you killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done!
<p/>A she-bear?
<p/>How are you, Arhip!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shook hands with the peasant and sat down on the edge of a chair, without taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) coat and hat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, take off your coat and stay a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I haven't time; I've only looked in for a tiny second,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>answered Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) threw open his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) coat, but afterwards did take it off, and sat on for a whole hour, talking to Levin about hunting and the most intimate subjects.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, tell me, please, what you did abroad?
<p/>Where have you been?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, when the peasant had gone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I stayed in Germany, in Prussia, in France, and in England-- not in the capitals, but in the manufacturing towns, and saw a great deal that was new to me.
<p/>And I'm glad I went.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I knew your idea of the solution of the labor question.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit: in Russia there can be no labor question.
<p/>In Russia the question is that of the relation of the working people to the land; though the question exists there too--but there it's a matter of repairing what's been ruined, while with us...''   (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>Stepan Arkadyevitch listened attentively to Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it's very possible you're right.
<p/>But I'm glad you're in good spirits, and are hunting bears, and working, and interested.
<p/>Shtcherbatsky told me another story--he (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatsky</b></font>) met you--that you were in such a depressed state, talking of nothing but death...''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, what of it?
<p/>I've not given up thinking of death,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's true that it's high time I was dead; and that all this is nonsense.
<p/>It's the truth I'm telling you.
<p/>I do value my idea and my work awfully; but in reality only consider this: all this world of ours is nothing but a speck of mildew, which has grown up on a tiny planet.
<p/>And for us to suppose we can have something great--ideas, work--it's all dust and ashes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But all that's as old as the hills, my boy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is old; but do you know, when you grasp this fully, then somehow everything becomes of no consequence.
<p/>When you understand that you will die tomorrow, if not today, and nothing will be left, then everything is so unimportant!
<p/>And I consider my idea very important, but it turns out really to be as unimportant too, even if it were carried out, as doing for that bear.
<p/>So one goes on living, amusing oneself with hunting, with work--anything so as not to think of death!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled a subtle affectionate smile as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevitch</b></font>) listened to Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, of course!
<p/>Here you've come round to my point.
<p/>Do you remember you attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life?
<p/>Don't be so severe, O moralist!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; all the same, what's fine in life is...''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin hesitated-- <div class="bookquote">``oh, I don't know.
<p/>All I know is that we shall soon be dead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so soon?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you know, there's less charm in life, when one thinks of death, but there's more peace.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, the finish is always the best.
<p/>But I must be going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting up for the tenth time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, stay a bit!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, when shall we see each other again?
<p/>I'm going tomorrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm a nice person!
<p/>Why, that's just what I came for!
<p/>You simply must come to dinner with us today.
<p/>Your brother's coming, and Karenin, my brother-in-law.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>)'s here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wanted to inquire about Kitty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had heard at the beginning of the winter that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was at Petersburg with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sister, the wife of the diplomat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>) did not know whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had come back or not; but he (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>) mind and did not ask.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)'s coming or not, I don't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>) said to himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you'll come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At five o'clock, then, and not evening dress.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>And Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and went down below to the new head of his (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>) department.
<p/>Instinct had not misled Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>The terrible new head turned out to be an extremely amenable person, and Stepan Arkadyevitch lunched with him (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>) and stayed on, so that it was four o'clock before he (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>) got to Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>Chapter 8   Alexey Alexandrovitch, on coming back from church service, had spent the whole morning indoors.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had two pieces of business before him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) that morning; first, to receive and send on a deputation from the native tribes which was on its way to Petersburg, and now at Moscow; secondly, to write the promised letter to the lawyer.
<p/>The deputation, though it had been summoned at Alexey Alexandrovitch's instigation, was not without its discomforting and even dangerous aspect, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had found it in Moscow.
<p/>The members of this deputation had not the slightest conception of their duty and the part they were to play.
<p/>They na√Øvely believed that it was their business to lay before the commission their needs and the actual condition of things, and to ask assistance of the government, and utterly failed to grasp that some of their statements and requests supported the contention of the enemy's side, and so spoiled the whole business.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch was busily engaged with them for a long while, drew up a program for them from which they were not to depart, and on dismissing them wrote a letter to Petersburg for the guidance of the deputation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) chief support in this affair in the Countess Lidia Ivanovna.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was a specialist in the matter of deputations, and no one knew better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) how to manage them, and put them in the way they should go.
<p/>Having completed this task, Alexey Alexandrovitch wrote the letter to the lawyer.
<p/>Without the slightest hesitation he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) permission to act as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) might judge best.
<p/>In the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) enclosed three of Vronsky's notes to Anna, which were in the portfolio he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had taken away.
<p/>Since Alexey Alexandrovitch had left home with the intention of not returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) family again, and since he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had been at the lawyer's and had spoken, though only to one man, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intention, since especially he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had translated the matter from the world of real life to the world of ink and paper, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had grown more and more used to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own intention, and by now distinctly perceived the feasibility of its execution.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sealing the envelope to the lawyer, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard the loud tones of Stepan Arkadyevitch's voice.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch was disputing with Alexey Alexandrovitch's servant, and insisting on being announced.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>thought Alexey Alexandrovitch, <div class="bookquote">``so much the better.
<p/>I will inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) at once of my position in regard to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sister, and explain why it is I can't dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said aloud, collecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) papers, and putting them in the blotting-paper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, you see, you're talking nonsense, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)'s at home!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>responded Stepan Arkadyevitch's voice, addressing the servant, who had refused to let him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) in, and taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) coat as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) went, Oblonsky walked into the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm awfully glad I've found you!
<p/>So I hope...''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>Stepan Arkadyevitch began cheerfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch said coldly, standing and not asking his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) visitor to sit down.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch had thought to pass at once into those frigid relations in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) ought to stand with the brother of a wife against whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was beginning a suit for divorce.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had not taken into account the ocean of kindliness brimming over in the heart of Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch opened wide his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) clear, shining eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't you?
<p/>What do you mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) asked in perplexity, speaking in French.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but it's a promise.
<p/>And we're all counting on you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to tell you that I can't dine at your house, because the terms of relationship which have existed between us must cease.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?
<p/>How do you mean?
<p/>What for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I am beginning an action for divorce against your sister, my wife.
<p/>I ought to have...''   (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>But, before Alexey Alexandrovitch had time to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sentence, Stepan Arkadyevitch was behaving not at all as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had expected.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) groaned and sank into an armchair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Alexey Alexandrovitch!
<p/>What are you saying?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Oblonsky, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) suffering was apparent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, I can't, I can't believe it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down, feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) words had not had the effect he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) anticipated, and that it would be unavoidable for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) position, and that, whatever explanations he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) might make, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) relations with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brother-in-law would remain unchanged.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am brought to the painful necessity of seeking a divorce,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will say one thing, Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>I know you for an excellent, upright man; I know Anna--excuse me, I can't change my opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)--for a good, an excellent woman; and so, excuse me, I cannot believe it.
<p/>There is some misunderstanding,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if it were merely a misunderstanding!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon, I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>interposed Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But of course....  One thing: you must not act in haste.
<p/>You must not, you must not act in haste!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not acting in haste,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch said coldly, <div class="bookquote">``but one cannot ask advice of anyone in such a matter.
<p/>I have quite made up my mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is awful!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would do one thing, Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>I beseech you, do it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No action has yet been taken, if I understand rightly.
<p/>Before you take advice, see my wife, talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loves Anna like a sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loves you, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s a wonderful woman.
<p/>For God's sake, talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)!
<p/>Do me that favor, I beseech you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered, and Stepan Arkadyevitch looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sympathetically, without interrupting his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) silence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will go to see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.
<p/>That was just why I have not been to see you.
<p/>I imagine our relations must change.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so?
<p/>I don't see that.
<p/>Allow me to believe that apart from our connection you have for me, at least in part, the same friendly feeling I have always had for you...and sincere esteem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Even if your worst suppositions were correct, I don't--and never would--take on myself to judge either side, and I see no reason why our relations should be affected.
<p/>But now, do this, come and see my wife.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we look at the matter differently,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch coldly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``However, we won't discuss it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; why shouldn't you come today to dine, anyway?
<p/>My wife's expecting you.
<p/>Please, do come.
<p/>And, above all, talk it over with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s a wonderful woman.
<p/>For God's sake, on my knees, I implore you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you so much wish it, I will come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch, sighing.
<p/>And, anxious to change the conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) inquired about what interested them both--the new head of Stepan Arkadyevitch's department, a man not yet old, who had suddenly been promoted to so high a position.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch had previously felt no liking for Count Anitchkin, and had always differed from him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) opinions.
<p/>But now, from a feeling readily comprehensible to officials--that hatred felt by one who has suffered a defeat in the service for one who has received a promotion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not endure him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, have you seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Alexey Alexandrovitch with a malignant smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was at our sitting yesterday.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) seems to know his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) work capitally, and to be very energetic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but what is his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) energy directed to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) aiming at doing anything, or simply undoing what's been done?
<p/>It's the great misfortune of our government--this paper administration, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)'s a worthy representative.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, I don't know what fault one could find with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) policy I don't know, but one thing--he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)'s a very nice fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>answered Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've just been seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)'s really a capital fellow.
<p/>We lunched together, and I taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) how to make, you know that drink, wine and oranges.
<p/>It's so cooling.
<p/>And it's a wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) didn't know it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) liked it awfully.
<p/>No, really he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)'s a capital fellow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) watch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, good heavens, it's four already, and I've still to go to Dolgovushin's!
<p/>So please come round to dinner.
<p/>You can't imagine how you will grieve my wife and me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>The way in which Alexey Alexandrovitch saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brother-in-law out was very different from the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've promised, and I'll come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) answered wearily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Believe me, I appreciate it, and I hope you won't regret it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>answered Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.
<p/>And, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) coat as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) patted the footman on the head, chuckled, and went out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At five o'clock, and not evening dress, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) shouted once more, turning at the door.
<p/>Chapter 9   It was past five, and several guests had already arrived, before the host himself got home.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went in together with Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev and Pestsov, who had reached the street door at the same moment.
<p/>These were the two leading representatives of the Moscow intellectuals, as Oblonsky had called them.
<p/>Both were men respected for their character and their intelligence.
<p/>They respected each other, but were in complete and hopeless disagreement upon almost every subject, not because they belonged to opposite parties, but precisely because they were of the same party -LRB-their enemies refused to see any distinction between their views-RRB-; but, in that party, each had his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) own special shade of opinion.
<p/>And since no difference is less easily overcome than the difference of opinion about semi-abstract questions, they never agreed in any opinion, and had long, indeed, been accustomed to jeer without anger, each at the other's incorrigible aberrations.
<p/>They were just going in at the door, talking of the weather, when Stepan Arkadyevitch overtook them.
<p/>In the drawing room there were already sitting Prince Alexander Dmitrievitch Shtcherbatsky, young Shtcherbatsky, Turovtsin, Kitty, and Karenin.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch saw immediately that things were not going well in the drawing-room without him (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>).
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) best gray silk gown, obviously worried about the children, who were to have their dinner by themselves in the nursery, and by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband's absence, was not equal to the task of making the party mix without him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>All were sitting like so many priests' wives on a visit -LRB-so the old prince expressed it-RRB-, obviously wondering why they were there, and pumping up remarks simply to avoid being silent.
<p/>Turovtsin--good, simple man--felt unmistakably a fish out of water, and the smile with which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thick lips greeted Stepan Arkadyevitch said, as plainly as words: <div class="bookquote">``Well, old boy, you have popped me down in a learned set!
<p/>A drinking party now, or the  Ch√¢teau des Fleurs , would be more in my line!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>The old prince sat in silence, his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) bright little eyes watching Karenin from one side, and Stepan Arkadyevitch saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had already formed a phrase to sum up that politician of whom guests were invited to partake as though he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) were a sturgeon.
<p/>Kitty was looking at the door, calling up all her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) energies to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) from blushing at the entrance of Konstantin Levin.
<p/>Young Shtcherbatsky, who had not been introduced to Karenin, was trying to look as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) were not in the least conscious of it.
<p/>Karenin himself had followed the Petersburg fashion for a dinner with ladies and was wearing evening dress and a white tie.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch saw by his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) had come simply to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) promise, and was performing a disagreeable duty in being present at this gathering.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) was indeed the person chiefly responsible for the chill benumbing all the guests before Stepan Arkadyevitch came in.
<p/>On entering the drawing room Stepan Arkadyevitch apologized, explaining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) had been detained by that prince, who was always the scapegoat for all his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) absences and unpunctualities, and in one moment he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had made all the guests acquainted with each other, and, bringing together Alexey Alexandrovitch and Sergey Koznishev, started them on a discussion of the Russification of Poland, into which they immediately plunged with Pestsov.
<p/>Slapping Turovtsin on the shoulder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) whispered something comic in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) ear, and set him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) down by his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife and the old prince.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) told Kitty she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was looking very pretty that evening, and presented Shtcherbatsky to Karenin.
<p/>In a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) had so kneaded together the social dough that the drawing room became very lively, and there was a merry buzz of voices.
<p/>Konstantin Levin was the only person who had not arrived.
<p/>But this was so much the better, as going into the dining room, Stepan Arkadyevitch found to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) horror that the port and sherry had been procured from Depr√®, and not from Levy, and, directing that the coachman should be sent off as speedily as possible to Levy's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>) was going back to the drawing room.
<p/>In the dining room he (<font color='blue'><b>Levy</b></font>) was met by Konstantin Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not late?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can never help being late!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arm.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you a lot of people?
<p/>Who's here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Levin, unable to help blushing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knocked the snow off his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) cap with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) glove.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All our own set.
<p/>Kitty's here.
<p/>Come along, I'll introduce you to Karenin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch, for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) liberal views, was well aware that to meet Karenin was sure to be felt a flattering distinction, and so treated his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) best friends to this honor.
<p/>But at that instant Konstantin Levin was not in a condition to feel all the gratification of making such an acquaintance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not seen Kitty since that memorable evening when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) met Vronsky, not counting, that is, the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had had a glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) on the highroad.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had known at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would see her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) here today.
<p/>But to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thoughts free, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had tried to persuade himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not know it.
<p/>Now when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was suddenly conscious of such delight, and at the same time of such dread, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) breath failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not utter what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wanted to say.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) like, what is she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) like?
<p/>Like what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) used to be, or like what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was in the carriage?
<p/>What if Darya Alexandrovna told the truth?
<p/>Why shouldn't it be the truth?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please, introduce me to Karenin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) brought out with an effort, and with a desperately determined step he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) walked into the drawing room and beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was not the same as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) used to be, nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had been in the carriage; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was quite different.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was scared, shy, shame-faced, and still more charming from it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) the very instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) walked into the room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had been expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was delighted, and so confused at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own delight that there was a moment, the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sister and glanced again at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>), and Dolly, who saw it all, thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) would break down and would begin to cry.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) crimsoned, turned white, crimsoned again, and grew faint, waiting with quivering lips for him (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), bowed, and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) hand without speaking.
<p/>Except for the slight quiver of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) lips and the moisture in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) eyes that made them brighter, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) smile was almost calm as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said:  <div class="bookquote">``How long it is since we've seen each other!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>and with desperate determination she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) hand with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) cold hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've not seen me, but I've seen you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, with a radiant smile of happiness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw you when you were driving from the railway station to Ergushovo.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) asked, wondering.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were driving to Ergushovo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, feeling as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would sob with the rapture that was flooding his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how dared I associate a thought of anything not innocent with this touching creature?
<p/>And, yes, I do believe it's true what Darya Alexandrovna told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch took him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) by the arm and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) away to Karenin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me introduce you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) mentioned their names.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very glad to meet you again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch coldly, shaking hands with Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are acquainted?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch asked in surprise.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We spent three hours together in the train,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin smiling, <div class="bookquote">``but got out, just as in a masquerade, quite mystified--at least I was.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!
<p/>Come along, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pointing in the direction of the dining room.
<p/>The men went into the dining-room and went up to a table, laid with six sorts of spirits and as many kinds of cheese, some with little silver spades and some without, caviar, herrings, preserves of various kinds, and plates with slices of French bread.
<p/>The men stood round the strong-smelling spirits and salt delicacies, and the discussion of the Russification of Poland between Koznishev, Karenin, and Pestsov died down in anticipation of dinner.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch was unequaled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) skill in winding up the most heated and serious argument by some unexpected pinch of Attic salt that changed the disposition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) opponent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) did this now.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch had been maintaining that the Russification of Poland could only be accomplished as a result of larger measures which ought to be introduced by the Russian government.
<p/>Pestsov insisted that one country can only absorb another when it is the more densely populated.
<p/>Koznishev admitted both points, but with limitations.
<p/>As they were going out of the drawing room to conclude the argument, Koznishev said, smiling:  <div class="bookquote">``So, then, for the Russification of our foreign populations there is but one method--to bring up as many children as one can.
<p/>My brother and I are terribly in fault, I see.
<p/>You married men, especially you, Stepan Arkadyevitch, are the real patriots: what number have you reached?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said, smiling genially at their host and holding out a tiny wine glass to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
<p/>Everyone laughed, and Stepan Arkadyevitch with particular good humor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, that's the best method!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said, munching cheese and filling the wine-glass with a special sort of spirit.
<p/>The conversation dropped at the jest.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This cheese is not bad.
<p/>Shall I give you some?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/>said the master of the house.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, have you been going in for gymnastics again?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) asked Levin, pinching his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) muscle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) left hand.
<p/>Levin smiled, bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arm, and under Stepan Arkadyevitch's fingers the muscles swelled up like a sound cheese, hard as a knob of iron, through the fine cloth of the coat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What biceps!
<p/>A perfect Samson!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I imagine great strength is needed for hunting bears,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>observed Alexey Alexandrovitch, who had the mistiest notions about the chase.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) cut off and spread with cheese a wafer of bread fine as a spider-web.
<p/>Levin smiled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all.
<p/>Quite the contrary; a child can kill a bear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, with a slight bow moving aside for the ladies, who were approaching the table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have killed a bear, I've been told!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Kitty, trying assiduously to catch with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) fork a perverse mushroom that would slip away, and setting the lace quivering over her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) white arm.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are there bears on your place?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) added, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) charming little head to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and smiling.
<p/>There was apparently nothing extraordinary in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, but what unutterable meaning there was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in every sound, in every turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) lips, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hand as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said it!
<p/>There was entreaty for forgiveness, and trust in him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and tenderness-- soft, timid tenderness--and promise and hope and love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not but believe in and which choked him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with happiness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, we've been hunting in the Tver province.
<p/>It was coming back from there that I met your  beaufr√®re  in the train, or your beaufr√®re's  brother-in-law,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) said with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was an amusing meeting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) began telling with droll good-humor how, after not sleeping all night, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) had, wearing an old fur-lined, full-skirted coat, got into Alexey Alexandrovitch's compartment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The conductor, forgetting the proverb, would have chucked me out on account of my attire; but thereupon I began expressing my feelings in elevated language, and...you, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) said, addressing Karenin and forgetting his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) name, <div class="bookquote">``at first would have ejected me on the ground of the old coat, but afterwards you took my part, for which I am extremely grateful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The rights of passengers generally to choose their seats are too ill-defined,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch, rubbing the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) fingers on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) handkerchief.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw you were in uncertainty about me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, smiling good-naturedly, <div class="bookquote">``but I made haste to plunge into intellectual conversation to smooth over the defects of my attire.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Sergey Ivanovitch, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) kept up a conversation with their hostess, had one ear for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) glanced askance at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) today?
<p/>Why such a conquering hero?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) thought.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) did not know that Levin was feeling as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had grown wings.
<p/>Levin knew she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) was listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) words and that she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) was glad to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>And this was the only thing that interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Not in that room only, but in the whole world, there existed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) only himself, with enormously increased importance and dignity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt himself on a pinnacle that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) giddy, and far away down below were all those nice excellent Karenins, Oblonskys, and all the world.
<p/>Quite without attracting notice, without glancing at them, as though there were no other places left, Stepan Arkadyevitch put Levin and Kitty side by side.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you may as well sit there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to Levin.
<p/>The dinner was as choice as the china, in which Stepan Arkadyevitch was a connoisseur.
<p/>The  soupe Marie-Louise  was a splendid success; the tiny pies eaten with it melted in the mouth and were irreproachable.
<p/>The two footmen and Matvey, in white cravats, did their duty with the dishes and wines unobtrusively, quietly, and swiftly.
<p/>On the material side the dinner was a success; it was no less so on the immaterial.
<p/>The conversation, at times general and at times between individuals, never paused, and towards the end the company was so lively that the men rose from the table, without stopping speaking, and even Alexey Alexandrovitch thawed.
<p/>Chapter 10   Pestsov liked thrashing an argument out to the end, and was not satisfied with Sergey Ivanovitch's words, especially as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) felt the injustice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) view.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) said over the soup, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch, <div class="bookquote">``mere density of population alone, but in conjunction with fundamental ideas, and not by means of principles.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch said languidly, and with no haste, <div class="bookquote">``that that's the same thing.

(<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But that's just the question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pestsov</b></font>)</div>Pestsov broke in in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) bass.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was always in a hurry to speak, and seemed always to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) whole soul into what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was saying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In what are we to make higher development consist?
<p/>The English, the French, the Germans, which is at the highest stage of development?
<p/>Which of them will nationalize the other?
<p/>We see the Rhine provinces have been turned French, but the Germans are not at a lower stage!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) shouted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is another law at work there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy that the greater influence is always on the side of true civilization,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch, slightly lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyebrows.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what are we to lay down as the outward signs of true civilization?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pestsov</b></font>)</div><p/>said Pestsov.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I imagine such signs are generally very well known,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But are they fully known?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>Sergey Ivanovitch put in with a subtle smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the accepted view now that real culture must be purely classical; but we see most intense disputes on each side of the question, and there is no denying that the opposite camp has strong points in its favor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are for classics, Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/>Will you take red wine?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not expressing my own opinion of either form of culture,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>Sergey Ivanovitch said, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) glass with a smile of condescension, as to a child.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only say that both sides have strong arguments to support them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) went on, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My sympathies are classical from education, but in this discussion I am personally unable to arrive at a conclusion.
<p/>I see no distinct grounds for classical studies being given a preeminence over scientific studies.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The natural sciences have just as great an educational value,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>put in Pestsov.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take astronomy, take botany, or zoology with its system of general principles.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot quite agree with that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>responded Alexey Alexandrovitch <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying the forms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual development.
<p/>Moreover, it cannot be denied that the influence of the classical authors is in the highest degree moral, while, unfortunately, with the study of the natural sciences are associated the false and noxious doctrines which are the curse of our day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Sergey Ivanovitch would have said something, but Pestsov interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) rich bass.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) began warmly contesting the justice of this view.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch waited serenely to speak, obviously with a convincing reply ready.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling subtly, and addressing Karenin, <div class="bookquote">``One must allow that to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of classical and scientific studies is a difficult task, and the question which form of education was to be preferred would not have been so quickly and conclusively decided if there had not been in favor of classical education, as you expressed it just now, its moral--disons le mot--anti-nihilist influence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it had not been for the distinctive property of anti-nihilistic influence on the side of classical studies, we should have considered the subject more, have weighed the arguments on both sides,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch with a subtle smile, <div class="bookquote">``we should have given elbow-room to both tendencies.
<p/>But now we know that these little pills of classical learning possess the medicinal property of anti-nihilism, and we boldly prescribe them to our patients....
<p/>But what if they had no such medicinal property?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) wound up humorously.
<p/>At Sergey Ivanovitch's little pills, everyone laughed; Turovtsin in especial roared loudly and jovially, glad at last to have found something to laugh at, all he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) ever looked for in listening to conversation.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch had not made a mistake in inviting Pestsov.
<p/>With Pestsov intellectual conversation never flagged for an instant.
<p/>Directly Sergey Ivanovitch had concluded the conversation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) jest, Pestsov promptly started a new one.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't agree even,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that the government had that aim.
<p/>The government obviously is guided by abstract considerations, and remains indifferent to the influence its measures may exercise.
<p/>The education of women, for instance, would naturally be regarded as likely to be harmful, but the government opens schools and universities for women.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education of women.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch expressed the idea that the education of women is apt to be confounded with the emancipation of women, and that it is only so that it can be considered dangerous.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I consider, on the contrary, that the two questions are inseparably connected together,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pestsov</b></font>)</div>said Pestsov; <div class="bookquote">``it is a vicious circle.
<p/>Woman is deprived of rights from lack of education, and the lack of education results from the absence of rights.
<p/>We must not forget that the subjection of women is so complete, and dates from such ages back that we are often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separates them from us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pestsov</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You said rights,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till Pestsov had finished, <div class="bookquote">``meaning the right of sitting on juries, of voting, of presiding at official meetings, the right of entering the civil service, of sitting in parliament...''   (<font color='red'><b>Pestsov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pestsov</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if women, as a rare exception, can occupy such positions, it seems to me you are wrong in using the expression `rights.'
<p/>It would be more correct to say duties.
<p/>Every man will agree that in doing the duty of a juryman, a witness, a telegraph clerk, we feel we are performing duties.
<p/>And therefore it would be correct to say that women are seeking duties, and quite legitimately.
<p/>And one can but sympathize with this desire to assist in the general labor of man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch assented.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The question, I imagine, is simply whether they are fitted for such duties.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They will most likely be perfectly fitted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, <div class="bookquote">``when education has become general among them.
<p/>We see this...''   (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How about the proverb?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>said the prince, who had a long while been intent on the conversation, his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) little comical eyes twinkling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can say it before my daughter: her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hair is long, because her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wit is...''   (<font color='red'><b>Pestsov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just what they thought of the negroes before their emancipation!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pestsov</b></font>)</div><p/>said Pestsov angrily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh duties,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, <div class="bookquote">``while we see, unhappily, that men usually try to avoid them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Duties are bound up with rights--power, money, honor; those are what women are seeking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pestsov</b></font>)</div>said Pestsov.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as though I should seek the right to be a wet-nurse and feel injured because women are paid for the work, while no one will take me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div>said the old prince.
<p/>Turovtsin exploded in a loud roar of laughter and Sergey Ivanovitch regretted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had not made this comparison.
<p/>Even Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but a man can't nurse a baby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pestsov</b></font>)</div>said Pestsov, <div class="bookquote">``while a woman...''   (<font color='red'><b>Pestsov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, there was an Englishman who did suckle his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) baby on board ship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pestsov</b></font>)</div>said the old prince, feeling this freedom in conversation permissible before his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) own daughters.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are as many such Englishmen as there would be women officials,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but what is a girl to do who has no family?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>put in Stepan Arkadyevitch, thinking of Masha Tchibisova, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) mind all along, in sympathizing with Pestsov and supporting him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If the story of such a girl were thoroughly sifted, you would find she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had abandoned a family--her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own or a sister's, where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might have found a woman's duties,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>Darya Alexandrovna broke in unexpectedly in a tone of exasperation, probably suspecting what sort of girl Stepan Arkadyevitch was thinking of.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we take our stand on principle as the ideal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pestsov</b></font>)</div>replied Pestsov in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) mellow bass.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Woman desires to have rights, to be independent, educated.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) is oppressed, humiliated by the consciousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) disabilities.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'm oppressed and humiliated that they won't engage me at the Foundling,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div>the old prince said again, to the huge delight of Turovtsin, who in his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) mirth dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) asparagus with the thick end in the sauce.
<p/>Chapter 11   Everyone took part in the conversation except Kitty and Levin.
<p/>At first, when they were talking of the influence that one people has on another, there rose to Levin's mind what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to say on the subject.
<p/>But these ideas, once of such importance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes, seemed to come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brain as in a dream, and had now not the slightest interest for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>It even struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) as strange that they should be so eager to talk of what was of no use to anyone.
<p/>Kitty, too, should, one would have supposed, have been interested in what they were saying of the rights and education of women.
<p/>How often she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had mused on the subject, thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) friend abroad, Varenka, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) painful state of dependence, how often she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had wondered about herself what would become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not marry, and how often she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had argued with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sister about it!
<p/>But it did not interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) at all.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) and Levin had a conversation of their own, yet not a conversation, but some sort of mysterious communication, which brought them every moment nearer, and stirred in both a sense of glad terror before the unknown into which they were entering.
<p/>At first Levin, in answer to Kitty's question how he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) last year in the carriage, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been coming home from the mowing along the highroad and had met her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was very, very early in the morning.
<p/>You were probably only just awake.
<p/>Your mother was asleep in the corner.
<p/>It was an exquisite morning.
<p/>I was walking along wondering who it could be in a four-in-hand?
<p/>It was a splendid set of four horses with bells, and in a second you flashed by, and I saw you at the window--you were sitting like this, holding the strings of your cap in both hands, and thinking awfully deeply about something,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How I should like to know what you were thinking about then!
<p/>Something important?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wasn't I dreadfully untidy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wondered, but seeing the smile of ecstasy these reminiscences called up, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) felt that the impression she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had made had been very good.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) blushed and laughed with delight; <div class="bookquote">``Really I don't remember.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How nicely Turovtsin laughs!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, admiring his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) moist eyes and shaking chest.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you known him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) long?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, everyone knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I see you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s a horrid man?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not horrid, but nothing in him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you're wrong!

<p/>Levin glanced once more at Turovtsin, and wondered how it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not realized all this man's goodness before.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, I'm sorry, and I'll never think ill of people again!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said gaily, genuinely expressing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt at the moment.
<p/>Chapter 12   Connected with the conversation that had sprung up on the rights of women there were certain questions as to the inequality of rights in marriage improper to discuss before the ladies.
<p/>Pestsov had several times during dinner touched upon these questions, but Sergey Ivanovitch and Stepan Arkadyevitch carefully drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) off them.
<p/>When they rose from the table and the ladies had gone out, Pestsov did not follow them, but addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch, began to expound the chief ground of inequality.
<p/>The inequality in marriage, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) opinion, lay in the fact that the infidelity of the wife and the infidelity of the husband are punished unequally, both by the law and by public opinion.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch went hurriedly up to Alexey Alexandrovitch and offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) a cigar.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't smoke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch answered calmly, and as though purposely wishing to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was not afraid of the subject, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) turned to Pestsov with a chilly smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I imagine that such a view has a foundation in the very nature of things,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, and would have gone on to the drawing room.
<p/>But at this point Turovtsin broke suddenly and unexpectedly into the conversation, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You heard, perhaps, about Pryatchnikov?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Turovtsin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Turovtsin, warmed up by the champagne he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had drunk, and long waiting for an opportunity to break the silence that had weighed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vasya Pryatchnikov,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, with a good-natured smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) damp, red lips, addressing himself principally to the most important guest, Alexey Alexandrovitch, <div class="bookquote">``they told me today he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) fought a duel with Kvitsky at Tver, and has killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Just as it always seems that one bruises oneself on a sore place, so Stepan Arkadyevitch felt now that the conversation would by ill luck fall every moment on Alexey Alexandrovitch's sore spot.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would again have got his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brother-in-law away, but Alexey Alexandrovitch himself inquired, with curiosity:  <div class="bookquote">``What did Pryatchnikov fight about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How glad I am you have come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>Dolly said with a frightened smile, meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) in the outer drawing room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's fortunate,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``especially as I was meaning to ask you to excuse me, and to be taking leave.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Darya Alexandrovna was firmly convinced of Anna's innocence, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt herself growing pale and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lips quivering with anger at this frigid, unfeeling man, who was so calmly intending to ruin her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) innocent friend.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexey Alexandrovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, with desperate resolution looking him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) in the face, <div class="bookquote">``I asked you about Anna, you made me no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it, I don't believe it, I can't believe it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly said, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) bony hands before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) with a vigorous gesture.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) rose quickly, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) hand on Alexey Alexandrovitch's sleeve.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall be disturbed here.
<p/>Come this way, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly's agitation had an effect on Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) got up and submissively followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) to the schoolroom.
<p/>They sat down to a table covered with an oilcloth cut in slits by penknives.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't, I don't believe it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly said, trying to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) glance that avoided her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One cannot disbelieve facts, Darya Alexandrovna,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), with an emphasis on the word <div class="bookquote">``facts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Darya Alexandrovna.

<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled coldly, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) lips alone, meaning to signify to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) and to himself the firmness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) conviction; but this warm defense, though it could not shake him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), reopened his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wound.

 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had no need to say that.

<p/>Chapter 13   When they rose from table, Levin would have liked to follow Kitty into the drawing room; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) might dislike this, as too obviously paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) attention.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) remained in the little ring of men, taking part in the general conversation, and without looking at Kitty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) movements, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) looks, and the place where she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was in the drawing room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did at once, and without the smallest effort, keep the promise he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)--always to think well of all men, and to like everyone always.
<p/>The conversation fell on the village commune, in which Pestsov saw a sort of special principle, called by him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) the choral principle.
<p/>Levin did not agree with Pestsov, nor with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, who had a special attitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own, both admitting and not admitting the significance of the Russian commune.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) talked to them, simply trying to reconcile and soften their differences.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not in the least interested in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said himself, and even less so in what they said; all he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wanted was that they and everyone should be happy and contented.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew now the one thing of importance; and that one thing was at first there, in the drawing room, and then began moving across and came to a standstill at the door.
<p/>Without turning round he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt the eyes fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and the smile, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not help turning round.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was standing in the doorway with Shtcherbatsky, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatsky</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were going towards the piano,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatsky</b></font>), going up to her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's something I miss in the country--music.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; we only came to fetch you and thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) said, rewarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatsky</b></font>) with a smile that was like a gift, <div class="bookquote">``for coming.
<p/>What do they want to argue for?
<p/>No one ever convinces anyone, you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; that's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin; <div class="bookquote">``it generally happens that one argues warmly simply because one can't make out what one's opponent wants to prove.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent people that after enormous efforts, and an enormous expenditure of logical subtleties and words, the disputants finally arrived at being aware that what they had so long been struggling to prove to one another had long ago, from the beginning of the argument, been known to both, but that they liked different things, and would not define what they liked for fear of its being attacked.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had often had the experience of suddenly in a discussion grasping what it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) opponent liked and at once liking it too, and immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) found himself agreeing, and then all arguments fell away as useless.
<p/>Sometimes, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had experienced the opposite, expressing at last what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) liked himself, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was devising arguments to defend, and, chancing to express it well and genuinely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had found his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) opponent at once agreeing and ceasing to dispute his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) position.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tried to say this.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) knitted her (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) brow, trying to understand.
<p/>But directly he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began to illustrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) meaning, she (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) understood at once.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know: one must find out what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) is arguing for, what is precious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), then one can...''   (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) had completely guessed and expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) badly expressed idea.
<p/>Levin smiled joyfully; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was struck by this transition from the confused, verbose discussion with Pestsov and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother to this laconic, clear, almost wordless communication of the most complex ideas.
<p/>Shtcherbatsky moved away from them, and Kitty, going up to a card table, sat down, and, taking up the chalk, began drawing diverging circles over the new green cloth.
<p/>They began again on the subject that had been started at dinner-- the liberty and occupations of women.
<p/>Levin was of the opinion of Darya Alexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find a woman's duties in a family.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) supported this view by the fact that no family can get on without women to help; that in every family, poor or rich, there are and must be nurses, either relations or hired.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, blushing, but looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) all the more boldly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) truthful eyes; <div class="bookquote">``a girl may be so circumstanced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) cannot live in the family without humiliation, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) herself...''   (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>At the hint he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, yes--you're right; you're right!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw all that Pestsov had been maintaining at dinner of the liberty of woman, simply from getting a glimpse of the terror of an old maid's existence and its humiliation in Kitty's heart; and loving her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that terror and humiliation, and at once gave up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arguments.
<p/>A silence followed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was still drawing with the chalk on the table.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes were shining with a soft light.
<p/>Under the influence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mood he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) being a continually growing tension of happiness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>I've scribbled all over the table!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, and, laying down the chalk, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) made a movement as though to get up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!
<p/>shall I be left alone--without her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought with horror, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took the chalk.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, sitting down to the table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've long wanted to ask you one thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looked straight into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) caressing, though frightened eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, ask it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wrote the initial letters,  w, y, t, m, i, c, n, b, d, t, m, n, o, t .
<p/>These letters meant, <div class="bookquote">``When you told me it could never be, did that mean never, or then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There seemed no likelihood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could make out this complicated sentence; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) life depended on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) understanding the words.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) seriously, then leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) puckered brow on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hands and began to read.
<p/>Once or twice she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) stole a look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), as though asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Is it what I think?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, flushing a little.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this word?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, pointing to the n that stood for never .
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It means  never ,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but that's not true!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) quickly rubbed out what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had written, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) the chalk, and stood up.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wrote,  t, i, c, n, a, d .
<p/>Dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) caught sight of the two figures: Kitty with the chalk in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hand, with a shy and happy smile looking upwards at Levin, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) handsome figure bending over the table with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the next on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was suddenly radiant: he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had understood.
<p/>It meant, <div class="bookquote">``Then I could not answer differently.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) questioningly, timidly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) smile answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And n...and now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, read this.
<p/>I'll tell you what I should like--should like so much!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wrote the initial letters, i, y, c, f, a, f, w, h. This meant, <div class="bookquote">``If you could forget and forgive what happened.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) snatched the chalk with nervous, trembling fingers, and breaking it, wrote the initial letters of the following phrase, <div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to forget and to forgive; I have never ceased to love you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with a smile that did not waver.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said in a whisper.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sat down and wrote a long phrase.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) understood it all, and without asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Is it this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>took the chalk and at once answered.
<p/>For a long while he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not understand what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had written, and often looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was stupefied with happiness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not supply the word she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had meant; but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) charming eyes, beaming with happiness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw all he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) needed to know.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wrote three letters.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had hardly finished writing when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) read them over her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) arm, and herself finished and wrote the answer, <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're playing  secr√©taire ?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>said the old prince.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we must really be getting along if you want to be in time at the theater.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin got up and escorted Kitty to the door.
<p/>In their conversation everything had been said; it had been said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father and mother that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would come tomorrow morning.
<p/>Chapter 14   When Kitty had gone and Levin was left alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt such uneasiness without her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and such an impatient longing to get as quickly, as quickly as possible, to tomorrow morning, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would see her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) again and be plighted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) forever, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt afraid, as though of death, of those fourteen hours that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to get through without her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>It was essential for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to be with someone to talk to, so as not to be left alone, to kill time.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch would have been the companion most congenial to him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was going out, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said, to a  soir√®e , in reality to the ballet.
<p/>Levin only had time to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was happy, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and would never, never forget what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had done for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>The eyes and the smile of Stepan Arkadyevitch showed Levin that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) comprehended that feeling fittingly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, so it's not time to die yet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pressing Levin's hand with emotion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``N-n-no!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna too, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said good-bye to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) a sort of congratulation, saying, <div class="bookquote">``How glad I am you have met Kitty again!
<p/>One must value old friends.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin did not like these words of Darya Alexandrovna's.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not understand how lofty and beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) it all was, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) ought not to have dared to allude to it.
<p/>Levin said good-bye to them, but, not to be left alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) attached himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to a meeting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll come with you.
<p/>May I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What for?
<p/>Yes, come along,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter with you today?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With me?
<p/>Happiness is the matter with me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, letting down the window of the carriage they were driving in.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mind?--it's so stifling.
<p/>It's happiness is the matter with me!
<p/>Why is it you have never married?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>Sergey Ivanovitch smiled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) seems a nice gi...''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>Sergey Ivanovitch was beginning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say it!
<p/>don't say it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>shouted Levin, clutching at the collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fur coat with both hands, and muffling him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) up in it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s a nice girl''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>were such simple, humble words, so out of harmony with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) feeling.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch laughed outright a merry laugh, which was rare with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, anyway, I may say that I'm very glad of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you may do tomorrow, tomorrow and nothing more!
<p/>Nothing, nothing, silence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, and muffling him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) once more in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fur coat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``I do like you so!
<p/>Well, is it possible for me to be present at the meeting?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is your discussion about today?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Levin, never ceasing smiling.
<p/>They arrived at the meeting.
<p/>Levin heard the secretary hesitatingly read the minutes which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) obviously did not himself understand; but Levin saw from this secretary's face what a good, nice, kind-hearted person he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was.
<p/>This was evident from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) confusion and embarrassment in reading the minutes.
<p/>Then the discussion began.
<p/>They were disputing about the misappropriation of certain sums and the laying of certain pipes, and Sergey Ivanovitch was very cutting to two members, and said something at great length with an air of triumph; and another member, scribbling something on a bit of paper, began timidly at first, but afterwards answered him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) very viciously and delightfully.
<p/>And then Sviazhsky -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) was there too-RRB- said something too, very handsomely and nobly.
<p/>Levin listened to them, and saw clearly that these missing sums and these pipes were not anything real, and that they were not at all angry, but were all the nicest, kindest people, and everything was as happy and charming as possible among them.
<p/>They did no harm to anyone, and were all enjoying it.
<p/>What struck Levin was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could see through them all today, and from little, almost imperceptible signs knew the soul of each, and saw distinctly that they were all good at heart.
<p/>And Levin himself in particular they were all extremely fond of that day.
<p/>That was evident from the way they spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), from the friendly, affectionate way even those he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not know looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, did you like it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>Sergey Ivanovitch asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much.
<p/>I never supposed it was so interesting!
<p/>Capital!
<p/>Splendid!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Sviazhsky went up to Levin and invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to come round to tea with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had disliked in Sviazhsky, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had failed to find in him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was a clever and wonderfully good-hearted man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most delighted,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, and asked after his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife and sister-in-law.
<p/>And from a queer association of ideas, because in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) imagination the idea of Sviazhsky's sister-in-law was connected with marriage, it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that there was no one to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could more suitably speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) happiness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was very glad to go and see them.
<p/>Sviazhsky questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) improvements on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) estate, presupposing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) always did, that there was no possibility of doing anything not done already in Europe, and now this did not in the least annoy Levin.
<p/>On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that Sviazhsky was right, that the whole business was of little value, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw the wonderful softness and consideration with which Sviazhsky avoided fully expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) correct view.
<p/>The ladies of the Sviazhsky household were particularly delightful.
<p/>It seemed to Levin that they knew all about it already and sympathized with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), saying nothing merely from delicacy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stayed with them one hour, two, three, talking of all sorts of subjects but the one thing that filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart, and did not observe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was boring them dreadfully, and that it was long past their bedtime.
<p/>Sviazhsky went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) into the hall, yawning and wondering at the strange humor his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) friend was in.
<p/>It was past one o'clock.
<p/>Levin went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hotel, and was dismayed at the thought that all alone now with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) impatience he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had ten hours still left to get through.
<p/>The servant, whose turn it was to be up all night, lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) candles, and would have gone away, but Levin stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>This servant, Yegor, whom Levin had noticed before, struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) as a very intelligent, excellent, and, above all, good-hearted man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Yegor, it's hard work not sleeping, isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One's got to put up with it!
<p/>It's part of our work, you see.
<p/>In a gentleman's house it's easier; but then here one makes more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Yegor</b></font>)</div><p/>It appeared that Yegor had a family, three boys and a daughter, a sempstress, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wanted to marry to a cashier in a saddler's shop.
<p/>Levin, on hearing this, informed Yegor that, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) opinion, in marriage the great thing was love, and that with love one would always be happy, for happiness rests only on oneself.
<p/>Yegor listened attentively, and obviously quite took in Levin's idea, but by way of assent to it he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) enunciated, greatly to Levin's surprise, the observation that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had lived with good masters he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had always been satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) masters, and now was perfectly satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) employer, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was a Frenchman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wonderfully good-hearted fellow!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but you yourself, Yegor, when you got married, did you love your wife?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!
<p/>and why not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Yegor</b></font>)</div><p/>responded Yegor.
<p/>And Levin saw that Yegor too was in an excited state and intending to express all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) most heartfelt emotions.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My life, too, has been a wonderful one.
<p/>From a child up...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was beginning with flashing eyes, apparently catching Levin's enthusiasm, just as people catch yawning.
<p/>But at that moment a ring was heard.
<p/>Yegor departed, and Levin was left alone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had eaten scarcely anything at dinner, had refused tea and supper at Sviazhsky's, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was incapable of thinking of supper.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not slept the previous night, but was incapable of thinking of sleep either.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) room was cold, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was oppressed by heat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) opened both the movable panes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) window and sat down to the table opposite the open panes.
<p/>Over the snow-covered roofs could be seen a decorated cross with chains, and above it the rising triangle of Charles's Wain with the yellowish light of Capella.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) gazed at the cross, then at the stars, drank in the fresh freezing air that flowed evenly into the room, and followed as though in a dream the images and memories that rose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) imagination.
<p/>At four o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) heard steps in the passage and peeped out at the door.
<p/>It was the gambler Myaskin, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gambler</b></font>) knew, coming from the club.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gambler</b></font>) walked gloomily, frowning and coughing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor, unlucky fellow!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Levin, and tears came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes from love and pity for this man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would have talked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and tried to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), but remembering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shirt on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind and sat down again at the open pane to bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross, silent, but full of meaning for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and the mounting lurid yellow star.
<p/>At seven o'clock there was a noise of people polishing the floors, and bells ringing in some servants' department, and Levin felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was beginning to get frozen.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) closed the pane, washed, dressed, and went out into the street.
<p/>Chapter 15   The streets were still empty.
<p/>Levin went to the house of the Shtcherbatskys.
<p/>The visitors' doors were closed and everything was asleep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) walked back, went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) room again, and asked for coffee.
<p/>The day servant, not Yegor this time, brought it to him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>).
<p/>Levin would have entered into conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), but a bell rang for the servant, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went out.
<p/>Levin tried to drink coffee and put some roll in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mouth, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mouth was quite at a loss what to do with the roll.
<p/>Levin, rejecting the roll, put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) coat and went out again for a walk.
<p/>It was nine o'clock when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) reached the Shtcherbatskys' steps the second time.
<p/>In the house they were only just up, and the cook came out to go marketing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) had to get through at least two hours more.
<p/>All that night and morning Levin lived perfectly unconsciously, and felt perfectly lifted out of the conditions of material life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had eaten nothing for a whole day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not slept for two nights, had spent several hours undressed in the frozen air, and felt not simply fresher and stronger than ever, but felt utterly independent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) body; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) moved without muscular effort, and felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could do anything.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could fly upwards or lift the corner of the house, if need be.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) spent the remainder of the time in the street, incessantly looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) watch and gazing about him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>And what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) never saw again after.
<p/>The children especially going to school, the bluish doves flying down from the roofs to the pavement, and the little loaves covered with flour, thrust out by an unseen hand, touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Those loaves, those doves, and those two boys were not earthly creatures.
<p/>It all happened at the same time: a boy ran towards a dove and glanced smiling at Levin; the dove, with a whir of her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wings, darted away, flashing in the sun, amid grains of snow that quivered in the air, while from a little window there came a smell of fresh-baked bread, and the loaves were put out.
<p/>All of this together was so extraordinarily nice that Levin laughed and cried with delight.
<p/>Going a long way round by Gazetny Place and Kislovka, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went back again to the hotel, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) watch before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sat down to wait for twelve o'clock.
<p/>In the next room they were talking about some sort of machines, and swindling, and coughing their morning coughs.
<p/>They did not realize that the hand was near twelve.
<p/>The hand reached it.
<p/>Levin went out onto the steps.
<p/>The sledge-drivers clearly knew all about it.
<p/>They crowded round Levin with happy faces, quarreling among themselves, and offering their services.
<p/>Trying not to offend the other sledge drivers, and promising to drive with them too, Levin took one and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to drive to the Shtcherbatskys'.
<p/>The sledge-driver was splendid in a white shirt-collar sticking out over his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) overcoat and into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) strong, full-blooded red neck.
<p/>The sledge was high and comfortable, and altogether such a one as Levin never drove in after, and the horse was a good one, and tried to gallop but didn't seem to move.
<p/>The driver knew the Shtcherbatskys' house, and drew up at the entrance with a curve of his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) arm and a <div class="bookquote">``Wo!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The driver</b></font>)</div><p/>especially indicative of respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) fare.
<p/>The Shtcherbatskys' hall-porter certainly knew all about it.
<p/>This was evident from the smile in his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) eyes and the way he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) said:  <div class="bookquote">``Well, it's a long while since you've been to see us, Konstantin Demitrievitch!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Not only he (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) knew all about it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) was unmistakably delighted and making efforts to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) joy.
<p/>Looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Demitrievitch</b></font>) kindly old eyes, Levin realized even something new in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) happiness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they up?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray walk in!
<p/>Leave it here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), smiling, as Levin would have come back to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hat.
<p/>That meant something.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To whom shall I announce your honor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the footman</b></font>)</div><p/>asked the footman.
<p/>The footman, though a young man, and one of the new school of footmen, a dandy, was a very kind-hearted, good fellow, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) too knew all about it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The princess...the prince...the young princess...''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/>The first person he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw was Mademoiselle Linon.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) walked across the room, and her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) ringlets and her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) face were beaming.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had only just spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), when suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard the rustle of a skirt at the door, and Mademoiselle Linon vanished from Levin's eyes, and a joyful terror came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) at the nearness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) happiness.
<p/>Mademoiselle Linon was in great haste, and leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), went out at the other door.
<p/>Directly she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had gone out, swift, swift light steps sounded on the parquet, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bliss, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) life, himself--what was best in himself, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had so long sought and longed for--was quickly, so quickly approaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) did not walk, but seemed, by some unseen force, to float to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) clear, truthful eyes, frightened by the same bliss of love that flooded his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Those eyes were shining nearer and nearer, blinding him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with their light of love.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) stopped still close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) hands rose and dropped onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had done all she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) could--she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had run up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and given herself up entirely, shy and happy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) and pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lips to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) mouth that sought his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) kiss.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) too had not slept all night, and had been expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) all the morning.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) mother and father had consented without demur, and were happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) happiness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had been waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) wanted to be the first to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) happiness and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had got ready to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) alone, and had been delighted at the idea, and had been shy and ashamed, and did not know herself what she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was doing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had heard his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) steps and voice, and had waited at the door for Mademoiselle Linon to go.
<p/>Mademoiselle Linon had gone away.
<p/>Without thinking, without asking herself how and what, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had gone up to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and did as she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was doing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go to mamma!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) said, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by the hand.
<p/>For a long while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could say nothing, not so much because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was afraid of desecrating the loftiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) emotion by a word, as that every time he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tried to say something, instead of words he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt that tears of happiness were welling up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) hand and kissed it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can it be true?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said at last in a choked voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't believe you love me, dear!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) smiled at that <div class="bookquote">``dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and at the timidity with which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) said significantly, deliberately.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so happy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Not letting go his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) went into the drawing room.
<p/>The princess, seeing them, breathed quickly, and immediately began to cry and then immediately began to laugh, and with a vigorous step Levin had not expected, ran up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and hugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head, kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), wetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) cheeks with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) tears.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it is all settled!
<p/>I am glad.
<p/>Love her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).
<p/>I am glad....
<p/>Kitty!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've not been long settling things,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prince Levin</b></font>)</div>said the old prince, trying to seem unmoved; but Levin noticed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes were wet when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've long, always wished for this!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>said the prince, taking Levin by the arm and drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) towards himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Even when this little feather-head fancied...''   (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Papa!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>shrieked Kitty, and shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) mouth with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hands.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I won't!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very, very ...plea ...Oh, what a fool I am...''   (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) embraced Kitty, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hand, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face again, and made the sign of the cross over her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>And there came over Levin a new feeling of love for this man, till then so little known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw how slowly and tenderly Kitty kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) muscular hand.
<p/>Chapter 16   The princess sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) armchair, silent and smiling; the prince sat  down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).
<p/>Kitty stood by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father's chair, still holding his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) hand.
<p/>All were silent.
<p/>The princess was the first to put everything into words, and to translate all thoughts and feelings into practical questions.
<p/>And all equally felt this strange and painful for the first minute.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When is it to be?
<p/>We must have the benediction and announcement.
<p/>And when's the wedding to be?
<p/>What do you think, Alexander?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexander</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div>said the old prince, pointing to Levin--<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s the principal person in the matter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin blushing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tomorrow; If you ask me, I should say, the benediction today and the wedding tomorrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,  mon cher , that's nonsense!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, in a week.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s quite mad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, why so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, upon my word!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/>said the mother, smiling, delighted at this haste.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How about the trousseau?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will there really be a trousseau and all that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin thought with horror.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But can the trousseau and the benediction and all that--can it spoil my happiness?
<p/>Nothing can spoil it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) glanced at Kitty, and noticed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was not in the least, not in the very least, disturbed by the idea of the trousseau.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it must be all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know nothing about it; I only said what I should like,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said apologetically.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll talk it over, then.
<p/>The benediction and announcement can take place now.
<p/>That's very well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The princess</b></font>)</div><p/>The princess went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) husband, kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and would have gone away, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), and, tenderly as a young lover, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) several times, smiling.
<p/>The old people were obviously muddled for a moment, and did not quite know whether it was they who were in love again or their daughter.
<p/>When the prince and the princess had gone, Levin went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) betrothed and took her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was self-possessed now and could speak, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had a great deal he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wanted to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said not at all what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to say.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How I knew it would be so!
<p/>I never hoped for it; and yet in my heart I was always sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that it was ordained.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Even when...''   (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) stopped and went on again, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) resolutely with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) truthful eyes, <div class="bookquote">``Even when I thrust from me my happiness.
<p/>I always loved you alone, but I was carried away.
<p/>I ought to tell you....  Can you forgive that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it was for the best.
<p/>You will have to forgive me so much.
<p/>I ought to tell you...''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This was one of the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had meant to speak about.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had resolved from the first to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) two things--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not chaste as she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not a believer.
<p/>It was agonizing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) considered he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ought to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) both these facts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not now, later!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, later, but you must certainly tell me.
<p/>I'm not afraid of anything.
<p/>I want to know everything.
<p/>Now it is settled.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``Settled that you'll take me whatever I may be--you won't give me up?
<p/>Yes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Linon</b></font>)</div><p/>Their conversation was interrupted by Mademoiselle Linon, who with an affected but tender smile came to congratulate her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) favorite pupil.
<p/>Before she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had gone, the servants came in with their congratulations.
<p/>Then relations arrived, and there began that state of blissful absurdity from which Levin did not emerge till the day after his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wedding.
<p/>Levin was in a continual state of awkwardness and discomfort, but the intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) happiness went on all the while increasing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt continually that a great deal was being expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)--what, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not know; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was told, and it all gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) happiness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) engagement would have nothing about it like others, that the ordinary conditions of engaged couples would spoil his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) special happiness; but it ended in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) doing exactly as other people did, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) happiness being only increased thereby and becoming more and more special, more and more unlike anything that had ever happened.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we shall have sweetmeats to eat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Linon</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle Linon-- and Levin drove off to buy sweetmeats.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm very glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>said Sviazhsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I advise you to get the bouquets from Fomin's.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, are they wanted?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drove to Fomin's.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother offered to lend him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) money, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would have so many expenses, presents to give...  <div class="bookquote">``Oh, are presents wanted?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) galloped to Foulde's.
<p/>And at the confectioner's, and at Fomin's, and at Foulde's he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was expected; that they were pleased to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and prided themselves on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) happiness, just as every one whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to do with during those days.
<p/>What was extraordinary was that everyone not only liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), but even people previously unsympathetic, cold, and callous, were enthusiastic over him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), gave way to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in everything, treated his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) feeling with tenderness and delicacy, and shared his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was the happiest man in the world because his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) betrothed was beyond perfection.
<p/>Kitty too felt the same thing.
<p/>When Countess Nordston ventured to hint that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nordston</b></font>) had hoped for something better, Kitty was so angry and proved so conclusively that nothing in the world could be better than Levin, that Countess Nordston had to admit it, and in Kitty's presence never met Levin without a smile of ecstatic admiration.
<p/>The confession he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had promised was the one painful incident of this time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) consulted the old prince, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sanction gave Kitty his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) diary, in which there was written the confession that tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had written this diary at the time with a view to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) future wife.
<p/>Two things caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) anguish: his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lack of purity and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lack of faith.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) confession of unbelief passed unnoticed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was religious, had never doubted the truths of religion, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) external unbelief did not affect her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in the least.
<p/>Through love she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) soul, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) soul she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) saw what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wanted, and that such a state of soul should be called unbelieving was to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a matter of no account.
<p/>The other confession set her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) weeping bitterly.
<p/>Levin, not without an inner struggle, handed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) diary.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew that between him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) there could not be, and should not be, secrets, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had decided that so it must be.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not realized what an effect it would have on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not put himself in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) place.
<p/>It was only when the same evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) came to their house before the theater, went into her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tear-stained, pitiful, sweet face, miserable with suffering he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had caused and nothing could undo, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt the abyss that separated his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shameful past from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dovelike purity, and was appalled at what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had done.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take them, take these dreadful books!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, pushing away the notebooks lying before her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) on the table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you give them me?
<p/>No, it was better anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) added, touched by his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) despairing face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's awful, awful!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head sank, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was silent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could say nothing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't forgive me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) whispered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I forgive you; but it's terrible!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) happiness was so immense that this confession did not shatter it, it only added another shade to it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>); but from that time more than ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) considered himself unworthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), morally bowed down lower than ever before her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and prized more highly than ever his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) undeserved happiness.
<p/>Chapter 17   Unconsciously going over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) memory the conversations that had taken place during and after dinner, Alexey Alexandrovitch returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) solitary room.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna's words about forgiveness had aroused in him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) nothing but annoyance.
<p/>The applicability or non-applicability of the Christian precept to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) own case was too difficult a question to be discussed lightly, and this question had long ago been answered by Alexey Alexandrovitch in the negative.
<p/>Of all that had been said, what stuck most in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) memory was the phrase of stupid, good-natured Turovtsin--'' Acted like a man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did!
<p/>Called him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out and shot him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! ''
<p/>Everyone had apparently shared this feeling, though from politeness they had not expressed it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the matter is settled, it's useless thinking about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself.
<p/>And thinking of nothing but the journey before him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and the revision work he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) room and asked the porter who escorted him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) where his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) man was.
<p/>The porter said that the man had only just gone out.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch ordered tea to be sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), sat down to the table, and taking the guidebook, began considering the route of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) journey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Two telegrams,''  (<font color='red'><b>manservant</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) manservant, coming into the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, your excellency; I'd only just that minute gone out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch took the telegrams and opened them.
<p/>The first telegram was the announcement of Stremov's appointment to the very post Karenin had coveted.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch flung the telegram down, and flushing a little, got up and began to pace up and down the room.  ''
<p/>Quos vult perdere dementat ,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, meaning by  quos  the persons responsible for this appointment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was not so much annoyed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had not received the post, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had been conspicuously passed over; but it was incomprehensible, amazing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) that they did not see that the wordy phrase-monger Stremov was the last man fit for it.
<p/>How could they fail to see how they were ruining themselves, lowering their  prestige  by this appointment?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something else in the same line,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to himself bitterly, opening the second telegram.
<p/>The telegram was from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) name, written in blue pencil, <div class="bookquote">``Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the first thing that caught his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am dying; I beg, I implore you to come.
<p/>I shall die easier with your forgiveness,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiled contemptuously, and flung down the telegram.
<p/>That this was a trick and a fraud, of that, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought for the first minute, there could be no doubt.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no deceit she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would stick at.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) confinement.
<p/>Perhaps it is the confinement.
<p/>But what can be their aim?
<p/>To legitimize the child, to compromise me, and prevent a divorce,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But something was said in it: I am dying...''   (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read the telegram again, and suddenly the plain meaning of what was said in it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if it is true?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is true that in the moment of agony and nearness to death she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is genuinely penitent, and I, taking it for a trick, refuse to go?
<p/>That would not only be cruel, and everyone would blame me, but it would be stupid on my part.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Piotr, call a coach; I am going to Petersburg,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) servant.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would go to Petersburg and see his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife.
<p/>If her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) illness was a trick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would say nothing and go away again.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was really in danger, and wished to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) before her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) alive, and pay her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the last duties if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) came too late.
<p/>All the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) thought no more of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) ought to do.
<p/>With a sense of weariness and uncleanness from the night spent in the train, in the early fog of Petersburg Alexey Alexandrovitch drove through the deserted Nevsky and stared straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), not thinking of what was awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not think about it, because in picturing what would happen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not drive away the reflection that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) death would at once remove all the difficulty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) position.
<p/>Bakers, closed shops, night-cabmen, porters sweeping the pavements flashed past his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) watched it all, trying to smother the thought of what was awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) dared not hope for, and yet was hoping for.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) drove up to the steps.
<p/>A sledge and a carriage with the coachman asleep stood at the entrance.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went into the entry, Alexey Alexandrovitch, as it were, got out his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) resolution from the remotest corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brain, and mastered it thoroughly.
<p/>Its meaning ran: <div class="bookquote">``If it's a trick, then calm contempt and departure.
<p/>If truth, do what is proper.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The porter</b></font>)</div><p/>The porter opened the door before Alexey Alexandrovitch rang.
<p/>The porter, Kapitonitch, looked queer in an old coat, without a tie, and in slippers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is your mistress?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A successful confinement yesterday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped short and turned white.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt distinctly now how intensely he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had longed for her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) death.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how is she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Korney</b></font>)</div><p/>Korney in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) morning apron ran downstairs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a consultation yesterday, and the doctor's here now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take my things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch, and feeling some relief at the news that there was still hope of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went into the hall.
<p/>On the hatstand there was a military overcoat.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch noticed it and asked:  <div class="bookquote">``Who is here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The doctor, the midwife, and Count Vronsky.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the inner rooms.
<p/>In the drawing room there was no one; at the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) steps there came out of her (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) boudoir the midwife in a cap with lilac ribbons.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) went up to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and with the familiarity given by the approach of death took him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) by the arm and drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) towards the bedroom.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God you've come!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) keeps on about you and nothing but you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Make haste with the ice!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>the doctor's peremptory voice said from the bedroom.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch went into her (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) boudoir.
<p/>At the table, sitting sideways in a low chair, was Vronsky, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face hidden in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hands, weeping.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) jumped up at the doctor's voice, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hands from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face, and saw Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>Seeing the husband, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was so overwhelmed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sat down again, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) shoulders, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wanted to disappear; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) made an effort over himself, got up and said:  <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) is dying.
<p/>The doctors say there is no hope.
<p/>I am entirely in your power, only let me be here...though I am at your disposal.
<p/>I...''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch, seeing Vronsky's tears, felt a rush of that nervous emotion always produced in him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) by the sight of other people's suffering, and turning away his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) moved hurriedly to the door, without hearing the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) words.
<p/>From the bedroom came the sound of Anna's voice saying something.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) voice was lively, eager, with exceedingly distinct intonations.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the bedroom, and went up to the bed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was lying turned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cheeks were flushed crimson, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes glittered, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) little white hands thrust out from the sleeves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dressing gown were playing with the quilt, twisting it about.
<p/>It seemed as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) were not only well and blooming, but in the happiest frame of mind.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was talking rapidly, musically, and with exceptionally correct articulation and expressive intonation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For Alexey--I am speaking of Alexey Alexandrovitch -LRB-what a strange and awful thing that both are Alexey, isn't it?-RRB-

<p/>Oh, that will be bad for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), my little girl!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what nonsense!''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would not forget.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>All of a sudden she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shrank back, was silent; and in terror, as though expecting a blow, as though to defend herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) husband.

<p/>Now I understand, I understand it all, I see it all!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch's wrinkled face wore an expression of agony; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) by the hand and tried to say something, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not utter it; his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) lower lip quivered, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) still went on struggling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) emotion, and only now and then glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>And each time he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) with such passionate and triumphant tenderness as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had never seen in them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute, you don't know...stay a little, stay!...''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was worse.

<p/>The nervous agitation of Alexey Alexandrovitch kept increasing, and had by now reached such a point that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) ceased to struggle with it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) suddenly felt that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had regarded as nervous agitation was on the contrary a blissful spiritual condition that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) all at once a new happiness he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had never known.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not think that the Christian law that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had been all his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) life trying to follow, enjoined on him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to forgive and love his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) enemies; but a glad feeling of love and forgiveness for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) enemies filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knelt down, and laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head in the curve of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) arm, which burned him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) as with fire through the sleeve, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sobbed like a little child.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) arm around his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head, moved towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and with defiant pride lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The doctor unloosed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hands, carefully laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) on the pillow, and covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) up to the shoulders.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) lay back submissively, and looked before her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) with beaming eyes.

<p/>The doctors said that it was puerperal fever, and that it was ninety-nine chances in a hundred it would end in death.
<p/>The whole day long there was fever, delirium, and unconsciousness.
<p/>At midnight the patient lay without consciousness, and almost without pulse.
<p/>The end was expected every minute.
<p/>Vronsky had gone home, but in the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) came to inquire, and Alexey Alexandrovitch meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) in the hall, said: <div class="bookquote">``Better stay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) might ask for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and himself led him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife's boudoir.
<p/>Towards morning, there was a return again of excitement, rapid thought and talk, and again it ended in unconsciousness.
<p/>On the third day it was the same thing, and the doctors said there was hope.
<p/>That day Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the boudoir where Vronsky was sitting, and closing the door sat down opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexey Alexandrovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, feeling that a statement of the position was coming, <div class="bookquote">``I can't speak, I can't understand.
<p/>Spare me!
<p/>However hard it is for you, believe me, it is more terrible for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) would have risen; but Alexey Alexandrovitch took him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) by the hand and said:  <div class="bookquote">``I beg you to hear me out; it is necessary.
<p/>I must explain my feelings, the feelings that have guided me and will guide me, so that you may not be in error regarding me.
<p/>You know I had resolved on a divorce, and had even begun to take proceedings.
<p/>I won't conceal from you that in beginning this I was in uncertainty, I was in misery; I will confess that I was pursued by a desire to revenge myself on you and on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>When I got the telegram, I came here with the same feelings; I will say more, I longed for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) death.
<p/>But...''   (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) paused, pondering whether to disclose or not to disclose his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) feeling to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and forgave her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>And the happiness of forgiveness has revealed to me my duty.
<p/>I forgive completely.
<p/>I would offer the other cheek, I would give my cloak if my coat be taken.
<p/>I pray to God only not to take from me the bliss of forgiveness!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Tears stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes, and the luminous, serene look in them impressed Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is my position: you can trample me in the mud, make me the laughing-stock of the world, I will not abandon her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and I will never utter a word of reproach to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch went on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My duty is clearly marked for me; I ought to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and I will be.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wishes to see you, I will let you know, but now I suppose it would be better for you to go away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) got up, and sobs cut short his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) words.
<p/>Vronsky too was getting up, and in a stooping, not yet erect posture, looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brows.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not understand Alexey Alexandrovitch's feeling, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt that it was something higher and even unattainable for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) view of life.
<p/>Chapter 18   After the conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch, Vronsky went out onto the steps of the Karenins' house and stood still, with difficulty remembering where he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) ought to walk or drive.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) felt disgraced, humiliated, guilty, and deprived of all possibility of washing away his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) humiliation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) felt thrust out of the beaten track along which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had so proudly and lightly walked till then.
<p/>All the habits and rules of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) life that had seemed so firm, had turned out suddenly false and inapplicable.
<p/>The betrayed husband, who had figured till that time as a pitiful creature, an incidental and somewhat ludicrous obstacle to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) happiness, had suddenly been summoned by her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) herself, elevated to an awe-inspiring pinnacle, and on the pinnacle that husband had shown himself, not malignant, not false, not ludicrous, but kind and straightforward and large.
<p/>Vronsky could not but feel this, and the parts were suddenly reversed.
<p/>Vronsky felt his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) elevation and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own abasement, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) truth and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own falsehood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt that the husband was magnanimous even in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sorrow, while he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been base and petty in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) deceit.
<p/>But this sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own humiliation before the man he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had unjustly despised made up only a small part of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) misery.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt unutterably wretched now, for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) passion for Anna, which had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) of late to be growing cooler, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) forever, was stronger than ever it had been.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had seen all of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) illness, had come to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) very soul, and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had never loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) till then.
<p/>And now when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had learned to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) should be loved, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been humiliated before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) forever, leaving with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) nothing of himself but a shameful memory.
<p/>Most terrible of all had been his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ludicrous, shameful position when Alexey Alexandrovitch had pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hands away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) humiliated face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) stood on the steps of the Karenins' house like one distraught, and did not know what to do.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A sledge, sir?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div><p/>asked the porter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, a sledge.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>On getting home, after three sleepless nights, Vronsky, without undressing, lay down flat on the sofa, clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) hands and laying his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) head on them.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) head was heavy.
<p/>Images, memories, and ideas of the strangest description followed one another with extraordinary rapidity and vividness.
<p/>First it was the medicine he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had poured out for the patient and spilt over the spoon, then the midwife's white hands, then the queer posture of Alexey Alexandrovitch on the floor beside the bed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To sleep!
<p/>To forget!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said to himself with the serene confidence of a healthy man that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is tired and sleepy, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will go to sleep at once.
<p/>And the same instant his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head did begin to feel drowsy and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to drop off into forgetfulness.
<p/>The waves of the sea of unconsciousness had begun to meet over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, when all at once--it was as though a violent shock of electricity had passed over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) started so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leaped up on the springs of the sofa, and leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms got in a panic onto his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were wide open as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never been asleep.
<p/>The heaviness in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head and the weariness in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) limbs that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had felt a minute before had suddenly gone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may trample me in the mud,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard Alexey Alexandrovitch's words and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) standing before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and saw Anna's face with its burning flush and glittering eyes, gazing with love and tenderness not at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) but at Alexey Alexandrovitch; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) fancied, foolish and ludicrous figure when Alexey Alexandrovitch took his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hands away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) legs again and flung himself on the sofa in the same position and shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To sleep!
<p/>To forget!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) repeated to himself.
<p/>But with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes shut he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw more distinctly than ever Anna's face as it had been on the memorable evening before the races.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not and will not be, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wants to wipe it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) memory.
<p/>But I cannot live without it.
<p/>How can we be reconciled?
<p/>how can we be reconciled?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said aloud, and unconsciously began to repeat these words.
<p/>This repetition checked the rising up of fresh images and memories, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt were thronging in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brain.
<p/>But repeating words did not check his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) imagination for long.
<p/>Again in extraordinarily rapid succession his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) best moments rose before his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) mind, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) recent humiliation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take away his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>Anna's voice says.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) takes away his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hands and feels the shamestruck and idiotic expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) still lay down, trying to sleep, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt there was not the smallest hope of it, and kept repeating stray words from some chain of thought, trying by this to check the rising flood of fresh images.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) listened, and heard in a strange, mad whisper words repeated: <div class="bookquote">``I did not appreciate it, did not make enough of it.
<p/>I did not appreciate it, did not make enough of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's this?
<p/>Am I going out of my mind?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said to himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps.
<p/>What makes men go out of their minds; what makes men shoot themselves?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) answered himself, and opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw with wonder an embroidered cushion beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), worked by Varya, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brother's wife.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) touched the tassel of the cushion, and tried to think of Varya, of when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) last.
<p/>But to think of anything extraneous was an agonizing effort.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I must sleep!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) moved the cushion up, and pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head into it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had to make an effort to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes shut.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) jumped up and sat down.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all over for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said to himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must think what to do.
<p/>What is left?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) mind rapidly ran through his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) life apart from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) love of Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ambition?
<p/>Serpuhovskoy?
<p/>Society?
<p/>The court?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not come to a pause anywhere.
<p/>All of it had had meaning before, but now there was no reality in it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) got up from the sofa, took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) coat, undid his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) belt, and uncovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hairy chest to breathe more freely, walked up and down the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is how people go mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``and how they shoot themselves...to escape humiliation,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) added slowly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went to the door and closed it, then with fixed eyes and clenched teeth he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went up to the table, took a revolver, looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), turned it to a loaded barrel, and sank into thought.
<p/>For two minutes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head bent forward with an expression of an intense effort of thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) stood with the revolver in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hand, motionless, thinking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said to himself, as though a logical, continuous, and clear chain of reasoning had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to an indubitable conclusion.
<p/>In reality this <div class="bookquote">``of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>that seemed convincing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), was simply the result of exactly the same circle of memories and images through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had passed ten times already during the last hour--memories of happiness lost forever.
<p/>There was the same conception of the senselessness of everything to come in life, the same consciousness of humiliation.
<p/>Even the sequence of these images and emotions was the same.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) repeated, when for the third time his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) thought passed again round the same spellbound circle of memories and images, and pulling the revolver to the left side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) chest, and clutching it vigorously with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) whole hand, as it were, squeezing it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) fist, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) pulled the trigger.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not hear the sound of the shot, but a violent blow on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) chest sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) reeling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) tried to clutch at the edge of the table, dropped the revolver, staggered, and sat down on the ground, looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) in astonishment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not recognize his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) room, looking up from the ground, at the bent legs of the table, at the wastepaper basket, and the tiger-skin rug.
<p/>The hurried, creaking steps of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) servant coming through the drawing room brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) senses.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) made an effort at thought, and was aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was on the floor; and seeing blood on the tiger-skin rug and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had shot himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Idiotic!
<p/>Missed!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, fumbling after the revolver.
<p/>The revolver was close beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sought further off.
<p/>Still feeling for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) stretched out to the other side, and not being strong enough to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) balance, fell over, streaming with blood.
<p/>The elegant, whiskered manservant, who used to be continually complaining to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) acquaintances of the delicacy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) nerves, was so panic-stricken on seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) master lying on the floor, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) losing blood while he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) ran for assistance.
<p/>An hour later Varya, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brother's wife, had arrived, and with the assistance of three doctors, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) had sent for in all directions, and who all appeared at the same moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) got the wounded man to bed, and remained to nurse him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 19   The mistake made by Alexey Alexandrovitch in that, when preparing for seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had overlooked the possibility that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) repentance might be sincere, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) might forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might not die--this mistake was two months after his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) return from Moscow brought home to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) in all its significance.
<p/>But the mistake made by him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had arisen not simply from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) having overlooked that contingency, but also from the fact that until that day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) interview with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) dying wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had not known his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own heart.
<p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sick wife's bedside he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) life given way to that feeling of sympathetic suffering always roused in him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) by the sufferings of others, and hitherto looked on by him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) with shame as a harmful weakness.
<p/>And pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and remorse for having desired her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) death, and most of all, the joy of forgiveness, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) at once conscious, not simply of the relief of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own sufferings, but of a spiritual peace he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had never experienced before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) suddenly felt that the very thing that was the source of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sufferings had become the source of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) spiritual joy; that what had seemed insoluble while he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was judging, blaming, and hating, had become clear and simple when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) forgave and loved.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) forgave his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife and pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sufferings and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) remorse.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) forgave Vronsky, and pitied him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), especially after reports reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) despairing action.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt more for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) son than before.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) blamed himself now for having taken too little interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>But for the little newborn baby he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt a quite peculiar sentiment, not of pity, only, but of tenderness.
<p/>At first, from a feeling of compassion alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had been interested in the delicate little creature, who was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) child, and who was cast on one side during her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother's illness, and would certainly have died if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had not troubled about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not himself observe how fond he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) became of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would go into the nursery several times a day, and sit there for a long while, so that the nurses, who were at first afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), got quite used to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) presence.
<p/>Sometimes for half an hour at a stretch he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would sit silently gazing at the saffron-red, downy, wrinkled face of the sleeping baby, watching the movements of the frowning brows, and the fat little hands, with clenched fingers, that rubbed the little eyes and nose.
<p/>At such moments particularly, Alexey Alexandrovitch had a sense of perfect peace and inward harmony, and saw nothing extraordinary in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) position, nothing that ought to be changed.
<p/>But as time went on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw more and more distinctly that however natural the position now seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would not long be allowed to remain in it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt that besides the blessed spiritual force controlling his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) soul, there was another, a brutal force, as powerful, or more powerful, which controlled his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) life, and that this force would not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) that humble peace he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) longed for.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt that everyone was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) with inquiring wonder, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was not understood, and that something was expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Above all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt the instability and unnaturalness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) relations with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife.
<p/>When the softening effect of the near approach of death had passed away, Alexey Alexandrovitch began to notice that Anna was afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), ill at ease with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and could not look him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) straight in the face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) seemed to be wanting, and not daring, to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) something; and as though foreseeing their present relations could not continue, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) seemed to be expecting something from him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Towards the end of February it happened that Anna's baby daughter, who had been named Anna too, fell ill.  Alexey Alexandrovitch was in the nursery in the morning, and leaving orders for the doctor to be sent for, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) office.
<p/>On finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) returned home at four.
<p/>Going into the hall he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw a handsome groom, in a braided livery and a bear fur cape, holding a white fur cloak.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Princess Elizaveta Federovna Tverskaya,''  (<font color='red'><b>the groom</b></font>)</div>the groom answered, and it seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) grinned.
<p/>During all this difficult time Alexey Alexandrovitch had noticed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) worldly acquaintances, especially women, took a peculiar interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife.
<p/>All these acquaintances he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) observed with difficulty concealing their mirth at something; the same mirth that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had perceived in the lawyer's eyes, and just now in the eyes of this groom.
<p/>Everyone seemed, somehow, hugely delighted, as though they had just been at a wedding.
<p/>When they met him (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>), with ill-disguised enjoyment they inquired after his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) wife's health.
<p/>The presence of Princess Tverskaya was unpleasant to Alexey Alexandrovitch from the memories associated with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>), and also because he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went straight to the nursery.
<p/>In the day nursery Seryozha, leaning on the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) legs on a chair, was drawing and chatting away merrily.
<p/>The English governess, who had during Anna's illness replaced the French one, was sitting near the boy knitting a shawl.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hurriedly got up, curtseyed, and pulled Seryozha.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) son's hair, answered the governess's inquiries about his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife, and asked what the doctor had said of the baby.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The doctor said it was nothing serious, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) ordered a bath, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is still in pain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch, listening to the baby's screaming in the next room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it's the wet-nurse, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Englishwoman</b></font>)</div>the Englishwoman said firmly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes you think so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) asked, stopping short.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just as it was at Countess Paul's, sir.
<p/>They gave the baby medicine, and it turned out that the baby was simply hungry: the nurse had no milk, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered, and after standing still a few seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went in at the other door.
<p/>The baby was lying with its head thrown back, stiffening itself in the nurse's arms, and would not take the plump breast offered it; and it never ceased screaming in spite of the double hushing of the wet-nurse and the other nurse, who was bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still no better?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)'s very restless,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>answered the nurse in a whisper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Edwarde says that perhaps the wet-nurse has no milk,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so too, Alexey Alexandrovitch.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why didn't you say so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's one to say it to?
<p/>Anna Arkadyevna still ill...''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>said the nurse discontentedly.
<p/>The nurse was an old servant of the family.
<p/>And in her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) simple words there seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch an allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) position.
<p/>The baby screamed louder than ever, struggling and sobbing.
<p/>The nurse, with a gesture of despair, went to it, took it from the wet-nurse's arms, and began walking up and down, rocking it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must ask the doctor to examine the wet-nurse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>The smartly dressed and healthy-looking nurse, frightened at the idea of losing her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) place, muttered something to herself, and covering her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) bosom, smiled contemptuously at the idea of doubts being cast on her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) abundance of milk.
<p/>In that smile, too, Alexey Alexandrovitch saw a sneer at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) position.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Luckless child!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div><p/>said the nurse, hushing the baby, and still walking up and down with it.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down, and with a despondent and suffering face watched the nurse walking to and fro.
<p/>When the child at last was still, and had been put in a deep bed, and the nurse, after smoothing the little pillow, had left her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>), Alexey Alexandrovitch got up, and walking awkwardly on tiptoe, approached the baby.
<p/>For a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was still, and with the same despondent face gazed at the baby; but all at once a smile, that moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hair and the skin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) forehead, came out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went as softly out of the room.
<p/>In the dining room he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) rang the bell, and told the servant who came in to send again for the doctor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) felt vexed with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wife for not being anxious about this exquisite baby, and in this vexed humor he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had no wish to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had no wish, either, to see Princess Betsy.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wife might wonder why he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did not go to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as usual; and so, overcoming his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) disinclination, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) went towards the bedroom.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) walked over the soft rug towards the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) could not help overhearing a conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did not want to hear.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hadn't been going away, I could have understood your answer and his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) too.
<p/>But your husband ought to be above that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>Betsy was saying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not for my husband; for myself I don't wish it.
<p/>Don't say that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>answered Anna's excited voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but you must care to say good-bye to a man who has shot himself on your account...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's just why I don't want to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>With a dismayed and guilty expression, Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped and would have gone back unobserved.
<p/>But reflecting that this would be undignified, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) turned back again, and clearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) throat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went up to the bedroom.
<p/>The voices were silent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went in.
<p/>Anna, in a gray dressing gown, with a crop of short clustering black curls on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) round head, was sitting on a settee.
<p/>The eagerness died out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face, as it always did, at the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head and looked round uneasily at Betsy.
<p/>Betsy, dressed in the height of the latest fashion, in a hat that towered somewhere over her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) head like a shade on a lamp, in a blue dress with violet crossway stripes slanting one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt, was sitting beside Anna, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tall flat figure held erect.
<p/>Bowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) greeted Alexey Alexandrovitch with an ironical smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, as though surprised.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very glad you're at home.
<p/>You never put in an appearance anywhere, and I haven't seen you ever since Anna has been ill.
<p/>I have heard all about it--your anxiety.
<p/>Yes, you're a wonderful husband!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, with a meaning and affable air, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) were bestowing an order of magnanimity on him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) conduct to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed frigidly, and kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife's hand, asked how she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, avoiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you've rather a feverish-looking color,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, laying stress on the word <div class="bookquote">``feverish.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We've been talking too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>said Betsy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel it's selfishness on my part, and I am going away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) got up, but Anna, suddenly flushing, quickly caught at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, wait a minute, please.
<p/>I must tell you...no, you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) turned to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) neck and brow were suffused with crimson.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't and can't keep anything secret from you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch cracked his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) fingers and bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Betsy's been telling me that Count Vronsky wants to come here to say good-bye before his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) departure for Tashkend.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) did not look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) husband, and was evidently in haste to have everything out, however hard it might be for her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) I could not receive him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said, my dear, that it would depend on Alexey Alexandrovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>Betsy corrected her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, I can't receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>); and what object would there...''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) stopped suddenly, and glanced inquiringly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) husband -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>)-RRB-.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In short, I don't wish it...''   (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch advanced and would have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) first impulse was to jerk back her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) hand from the damp hand with big swollen veins that sought hers, but with an obvious effort to control herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very grateful to you for your confidence, but...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, feeling with confusion and annoyance that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could decide easily and clearly by himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not discuss before Princess Tverskaya, who to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) stood for the incarnation of that brute force which would inevitably control him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) in the life he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) led in the eyes of the world, and hinder him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) from giving way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) feeling of love and forgiveness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) stopped short, looking at Princess Tverskaya.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, good-bye, my darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>said Betsy, getting up.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) kissed Anna, and went out.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch escorted her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexey Alexandrovitch!
<p/>I know you are a truly magnanimous man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>said Betsy, stopping in the little drawing-room, and with special warmth shaking hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) once more.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am an outsider, but I so love her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) and respect you that I venture to advise.
<p/>Receive him (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>).
<p/>Alexey Vronsky is the soul of honor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) is going away to Tashkend.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, princess, for your sympathy and advice.
<p/>But the question of whether my wife can or cannot see anyone she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must decide herself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said this from habit, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) brows with dignity, and reflected immediately that whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) words might be, there could be no dignity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) position.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) saw this by the suppressed, malicious, and ironical smile with which Betsy glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) after this phrase.
<p/>Chapter 20   Alexey Alexandrovitch took leave of Betsy in the drawing room, and went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) was lying down, but hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) steps she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) sat up hastily in her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) former attitude, and looked in a scared way at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) had been crying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very grateful for your confidence in me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) repeated gently in Russian the phrase he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had said in Betsy's presence in French, and sat down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>).
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) in Russian, using the Russian <div class="bookquote">``thou''  (<font color='red'><b>Russian</b></font>)</div>of intimacy and affection, it was insufferably irritating to Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am very grateful for your decision.
<p/>I, too, imagine that since he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) is going away, there is no sort of necessity for Count Vronsky to come here.
<p/>However, if...''   (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I've said so already, so why repeat it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna suddenly interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) with an irritation she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not succeed in repressing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No sort of necessity,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``for a man to come and say good-bye to the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves, for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was ready to ruin himself, and has ruined himself, and who cannot live without him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>No sort of necessity!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) compressed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips, and dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) burning eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands with their swollen veins.
<p/>They were rubbing each other.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us never speak of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added more calmly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have left this question to you to decide, and I am very glad to see...''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch was beginning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That my wish coincides with your own,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) finished quickly, exasperated at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) talking so slowly while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew beforehand all he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would say.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) assented; <div class="bookquote">``and Princess Tverskaya's interference in the most difficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) really cares for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed and said nothing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) played nervously with the tassel of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dressing-gown, glancing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) with that torturing sensation of physical repulsion for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) blamed herself, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not control it.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) only desire now was to be rid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) oppressive presence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just sent for the doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very well; what do I want the doctor for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, the little one cries, and they say the nurse hasn't enough milk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) rang the bell and ordered the baby to be brought her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I begged to nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>), I wasn't allowed to, and now I'm blamed for it.''

<p/>My God!
<p/>why didn't I die!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) broke into sobs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, I'm nervous, I'm unjust,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said, controlling herself, <div class="bookquote">``but do go away...''   (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, it can't go on like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself decidedly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife's room.
<p/>Never had the impossibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) position in the world's eyes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife's hatred of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and altogether the might of that mysterious brutal force that guided his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) life against his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) spiritual inclinations, and exacted conformity with its decrees and change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) attitude to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife, been presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) with such distinctness as that day.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw clearly that all the world and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) something, but what exactly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not make out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt that this was rousing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) soul a feeling of anger destructive of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) peace of mind and of all the good of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) achievement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) believed that for Anna herself it would be better to break off all relations with Vronsky; but if they all thought this out of the question, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was even ready to allow these relations to be renewed, so long as the children were not disgraced, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was not deprived of them nor forced to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) position.
<p/>Bad as this might be, it was anyway better than a rupture, which would put her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in a hopeless and shameful position, and deprive him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) of everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) cared for.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt helpless; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knew beforehand that every one was against him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would not be allowed to do what seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) now so natural and right, but would be forced to do what was wrong, though it seemed the proper thing to them.
<p/>Chapter 21   Before Betsy had time to walk out of the drawing-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) was met in the doorway by Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had just come from Yeliseev's, where a consignment of fresh oysters had been received.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>princess!
<p/>what a delightful meeting!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) began.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A meeting for one minute, for I'm going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>said Betsy, smiling and putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) glove.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't put on your glove yet, princess; let me kiss your hand.
<p/>There's nothing I'm so thankful to the revival of the old fashions for as the kissing the hand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) kissed Betsy's hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I deserve a great deal, for I've become a most serious person.
<p/>I don't only manage my own affairs, but other people's too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, with a significant expression.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm so glad!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>answered Betsy, at once understanding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was speaking of Anna.
<p/>And going back into the drawing room, they stood in a corner.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)'s killing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div>said Betsy in a whisper full of meaning.

<p/>One of two things: either let him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) take her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) away, act with energy, or give her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) a divorce.

 (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Betsy.
<p/>After accompanying Betsy to the outside hall, once more kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) hand above the glove, at the point where the pulse beats, and murmuring to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) such unseemly nonsense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) did not know whether to laugh or be angry, Stepan Arkadyevitch went to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sister.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in tears.
<p/>Although he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) happened to be bubbling over with good spirits, Stepan Arkadyevitch immediately and quite naturally fell into the sympathetic, poetically emotional tone which harmonized with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had spent the morning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very, very miserably.

<p/>No one else in Stepan Arkadyevitch's place, having to do with such despair, would have ventured to smile -LRB-the smile would have seemed brutal-RRB-; but in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) smile there was so much of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) smile did not wound, but softened and soothed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gentle, soothing words and smiles were as soothing and softening as almond oil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said.

 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>With some effort Stepan Arkadyevitch brought out his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) central idea, and looked significantly at her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said nothing, and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) cropped head in dissent.
<p/>But from the look in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) face, that suddenly brightened into its old beauty, he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) saw that if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) did not desire this, it was simply because it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) unattainable happiness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm awfully sorry for you!
<p/>And how happy I should be if I could arrange things!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling more boldly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak, don't say a word!
<p/>God grant only that I may speak as I feel.
<p/>I'm going to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with dreamy, shining eyes, and said nothing.
<p/>Chapter 22   Stepan Arkadyevitch, with the same somewhat solemn expression with which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) used to take his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) presidential chair at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) board, walked into Alexey Alexandrovitch's room.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch was walking about his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) room with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hands behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) back, thinking of just what Stepan Arkadyevitch had been discussing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not interrupting you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, on the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brother-in-law becoming suddenly aware of a sense of embarrassment unusual with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>To conceal this embarrassment he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) took out a cigarette case he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had just bought that opened in a new way, and sniffing the leather, took a cigarette out of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.
<p/>Do you want anything?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch asked without eagerness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I wished...I wanted...yes, I wanted to talk to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, with surprise aware of an unaccustomed timidity.
<p/>This feeling was so unexpected and so strange that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not believe it was the voice of conscience telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was meaning to do was wrong.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch made an effort and struggled with the timidity that had come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere affection and respect for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, reddening.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch stood still and said nothing, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face struck Stepan Arkadyevitch by its expression of an unresisting sacrifice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I intended...I wanted to have a little talk with you about my sister and your mutual position,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, still struggling with an unaccustomed constraint.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled mournfully, looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brother-in-law, and without answering went up to the table, took from it an unfinished letter, and handed it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brother-in-law.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think unceasingly of the same thing.
<p/>And here is what I had begun writing, thinking I could say it better by letter, and that my presence irritates her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) the letter.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch took the letter, looked with incredulous surprise at the lusterless eyes fixed so immovably on him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and began to read.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see that my presence is irksome to you.
<p/>Painful as it is to me to believe it, I see that it is so, and cannot be otherwise.
<p/>I don't blame you, and God is my witness that on seeing you at the time of your illness I resolved with my whole heart to forget all that had passed between us and to begin a new life.
<p/>I do not regret, and shall never regret, what I have done; but I have desired one thing--your good, the good of your soul--and now I see I have not attained that.
<p/>Tell me yourself what will give you true happiness and peace to your soul.
<p/>I put myself entirely in your hands, and trust to your feeling of what's right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch handed back the letter, and with the same surprise continued looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) brother-in-law, not knowing what to say.
<p/>This silence was so awkward for both of them that Stepan Arkadyevitch's lips began twitching nervously, while he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) still gazed without speaking at Karenin's face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I wanted to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch, turning away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes...''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, not able to answer for the tears that were choking him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brought out at last.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) would like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch.

 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) added, with a gesture of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hands before his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes not usual with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see no possible way out of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is some way of getting out of every position,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, standing up and becoming more cheerful.

<p/>If you are convinced now that you cannot make each other happy...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Happiness may be variously understood.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you care to know my opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch with the same smile of softening, almond-oil tenderness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had been talking to Anna.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) kindly smile was so winning that Alexey Alexandrovitch, feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own weakness and unconsciously swayed by it, was ready to believe what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) will never speak out about it.
<p/>But one thing is possible, one thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) might desire,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``that is the cessation of your relations and all memories associated with them.
<p/>To my thinking, in your position what's essential is the formation of a new attitude to one another.
<p/>And that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both sides.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Divorce,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted, in a tone of aversion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I imagine that divorce--yes, divorce,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>Stepan Arkadyevitch repeated, reddening.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is from every point of view the most rational course for married people who find themselves in the position you are in.
<p/>What can be done if married people find that life is impossible for them together?
<p/>That may always happen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed heavily and closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's only one point to be considered: is either of the parties desirous of forming new ties?
<p/>If not, it is very simple,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, feeling more and more free from constraint.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch, scowling with emotion, muttered something to himself, and made no answer.
<p/>All that seemed so simple to Stepan Arkadyevitch, Alexey Alexandrovitch had thought over thousands of times.
<p/>And, so far from being simple, it all seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) utterly impossible.
<p/>Divorce, the details of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knew by this time, seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) now out of the question, because the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own dignity and respect for religion forbade his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) taking upon himself a fictitious charge of adultery, and still more suffering his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife, pardoned and beloved by him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), to be caught in the fact and put to public shame.
<p/>Divorce appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) impossible also on other still more weighty grounds.
<p/>What would become of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) son in case of a divorce?
<p/>To leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) mother was out of the question.
<p/>The divorced mother would have her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own illegitimate family, in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) position as a stepson and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) education would not be good.
<p/>Keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knew that would be an act of vengeance on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) part, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not want.
<p/>But apart from this, what more than all made divorce seem impossible to Alexey Alexandrovitch was, that by consenting to a divorce he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would be completely ruining Anna.
<p/>The saying of Darya Alexandrovna at Moscow, that in deciding on a divorce he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was thinking of himself, and not considering that by this he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would be ruining her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) irrevocably, had sunk into his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) heart.
<p/>And connecting this saying with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) forgiveness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) devotion to the children, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) understood it now in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own way.
<p/>To consent to a divorce, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) freedom, meant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) thoughts to take from himself the last tie that bound him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to life--the children whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) loved; and to take from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) the last prop that stayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) on the path of right, to thrust her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ruin.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) were divorced, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would join her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) life to Vronsky's, and their tie would be an illegitimate and criminal one, since a wife, by the interpretation of the ecclesiastical law, could not marry while her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband was living.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will join him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and in a year or two he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will throw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) over, or she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will form a new tie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>thought Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I, by agreeing to an unlawful divorce, shall be to blame for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ruin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had thought it all over hundreds of times, and was convinced that a divorce was not at all simple, as Stepan Arkadyevitch had said, but was utterly impossible.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not believe a single word Stepan Arkadyevitch said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>); to every word he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had a thousand objections to make, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) words were the expression of that mighty brutal force which controlled his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) life and to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would have to submit.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The only question is on what terms you agree to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) a divorce.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) does not want anything, does not dare ask you for anything, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) leaves it all to your generosity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Alexey Alexandrovitch, remembering the details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took the blame on himself, and with just the same gesture with which Vronsky had done the same, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) face for shame in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) hands.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are distressed, I understand that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) cried in a shrill voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will take the disgrace on myself, I will give up even my son, but...but wouldn't it be better to let it alone?
<p/>Still you may do as you like...''   (<font color='red'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>)</div>And turning away so that his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) brother-in-law could not see him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sat down on a chair at the window.
<p/>There was bitterness, there was shame in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) heart, but with bitterness and shame he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) felt joy and emotion at the height of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own meekness.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch was touched.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was silent for a space.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexey Alexandrovitch, believe me, she (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) appreciates your generosity,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it seems it was the will of God,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) added, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said it felt how foolish a remark it was, and with difficulty repressed a smile at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own foolishness.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch would have made some reply, but tears stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is an unhappy fatality, and one must accept it as such.
<p/>I accept the calamity as an accomplished fact, and am doing my best to help both her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brother-in-law's room he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was touched, but that did not prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) from being glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had successfully brought the matter to a conclusion, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt certain Alexey Alexandrovitch would not go back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) words.
<p/>To this satisfaction was added the fact that an idea had just struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) for a riddle turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) successful achievement, that when the affair was over he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife and most intimate friends.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) put this riddle into two or three different ways.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'll work it out better than that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said to himself with a smile.
<p/>Chapter 23   Vronsky's wound had been a dangerous one, though it did not touch the heart, and for several days he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had lain between life and death.
<p/>The first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was able to speak, Varya, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brother's wife, was alone in the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Varya,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, looking sternly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I shot myself by accident.
<p/>And please never speak of it, and tell everyone so.
<p/>Or else it's too ridiculous.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Without answering his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) words, Varya bent over him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and with a delighted smile gazed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes were clear, not feverish; but their expression was stern.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not in pain?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pointed to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) breast.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let me change your bandages.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In silence, stiffening his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) broad jaws, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) bandaged him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) up.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) had finished he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said:  <div class="bookquote">``I'm not delirious.
<p/>Please manage that there may be no talk of my having shot myself on purpose.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one does say so.
<p/>Only I hope you won't shoot yourself by accident any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) said, with a questioning smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I won't, but it would have been better...''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) smiled gloomily.
<p/>In spite of these words and this smile, which so frightened Varya, when the inflammation was over and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) began to recover, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was completely free from one part of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) misery.
<p/>By his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) action he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had, as it were, washed away the shame and humiliation he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had felt before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could now think calmly of Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) recognized all his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) magnanimity, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not now feel himself humiliated by it.
<p/>Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) got back again into the beaten track of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw the possibility of looking men in the face again without shame, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could live in accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own habits.
<p/>One thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not pluck out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) heart, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) never ceased struggling with it, was the regret, amounting to despair, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) forever.
<p/>That now, having expiated his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sin against the husband, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was bound to renounce her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and never in future to stand between her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) repentance and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) husband, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had firmly decided in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart; but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not tear out of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) regret at the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) love, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not erase from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) memory those moments of happiness that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had so little prized at the time, and that haunted him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in all their charm.
<p/>Serpuhovskoy had planned his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) appointment at Tashkend, and Vronsky agreed to the proposition without the slightest hesitation.
<p/>But the nearer the time of departure came, the bitterer was the sacrifice he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was making to what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) duty.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wound had healed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was driving about making preparations for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) departure for Tashkend.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To see her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) once and then to bury myself, to die,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thought, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was paying farewell visits, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) uttered this thought to Betsy.
<p/>Charged with this commission, Betsy had gone to Anna, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) back a negative reply.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>thought Vronsky, when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) received the news.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a weakness, which would have shattered what strength I have left.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Betsy/Tverskaya/Betsy Tverskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Next day Betsy herself came to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in the morning, and announced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) had heard through Oblonsky as a positive fact that Alexey Alexandrovitch had agreed to a divorce, and that therefore Vronsky could see Anna.
<p/>Without even troubling himself to see Betsy out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) flat, forgetting all his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) resolutions, without asking when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>), where her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) husband was, Vronsky drove straight to the Karenins'.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) ran up the stairs seeing no one and nothing, and with a rapid step, almost breaking into a run, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) went into her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) room.
<p/>And without considering, without noticing whether there was anyone in the room or not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>), and began to cover her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) face, her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) hands, her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) neck with kisses.
<p/>Anna had been preparing herself for this meeting, had thought what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not succeed in saying anything of it; his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) passion mastered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tried to calm him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), to calm herself, but it was too late.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) feeling infected her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lips trembled so that for a long while she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could say nothing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you have conquered me, and I am yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said at last, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bosom.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it had to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So long as we live, it must be so.
<p/>I know it now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, getting whiter and whiter, and embracing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still there is something terrible in it after all that has happened.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will all pass, it will all pass; we shall be so happy.
<p/>Our love, if it could be stronger, will be strengthened by there being something terrible in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) head and parting his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) strong teeth in a smile.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not but respond with a smile--not to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) words, but to the love in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) hand and stroked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) chilled cheeks and cropped head with it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know you with this short hair.

<p/>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lips began trembling again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll go to Italy; you will get strong,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can it be possible we could be like husband and wife, alone, your family with you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, looking close into his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It only seems strange to me that it can ever have been otherwise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stiva says that  he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)  has agreed to everything, but I can't accept his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)  generosity,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, looking dreamily past Vronsky's face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want a divorce; it's all the same to me now.
<p/>Only I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will decide about Seryozha.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not conceive how at this moment of their meeting she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could remember and think of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) son, of divorce.
<p/>What did it all matter?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak of that, don't think of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and trying to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) attention to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); but still she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, why didn't I die!
<p/>it would have been better,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, and silent tears flowed down both her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cheeks; but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tried to smile, so as not to wound him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>To decline the flattering and dangerous appointment at Tashkend would have been, Vronsky had till then considered, disgraceful and impossible.
<p/>But now, without an instant's consideration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) declined it, and observing dissatisfaction in the most exalted quarters at this step, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) immediately retired from the army.
<p/>A month later Alexey Alexandrovitch was left alone with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) son in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) house at Petersburg, while Anna and Vronsky had gone abroad, not having obtained a divorce, but having absolutely declined all idea of one.
<p/>PART 5    Chapter 1   Princess Shtcherbatskaya considered that it was out of the question for the wedding to take place before Lent, just five weeks off, since not half the trousseau could possibly be ready by that time.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>) could not but agree with Levin that to fix it for after Lent would be putting it off too late, as an old aunt of Prince Shtcherbatsky's was seriously ill and might die, and then the mourning would delay the wedding still longer.
<p/>And therefore, deciding to divide the trousseau into two parts--a larger and smaller trousseau--the princess consented to have the wedding before Lent.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) would get the smaller part of the trousseau all ready now, and the larger part should be made later, and she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was much vexed with Levin because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was incapable of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) a serious answer to the question whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) agreed to this arrangement or not.
<p/>The arrangement was the more suitable as, immediately after the wedding, the young people were to go to the country, where the more important part of the trousseau would not be wanted.
<p/>Levin still continued in the same delirious condition in which it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) happiness constituted the chief and sole aim of all existence, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) need not now think or care about anything, that everything was being done and would be done for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) by others.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not even plans and aims for the future, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) left its arrangement to others, knowing that everything would be delightful.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother Sergey Ivanovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch, and the princess guided him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in doing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to do.
<p/>All he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did was to agree entirely with everything suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother raised money for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), the princess advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to leave Moscow after the wedding.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to go abroad.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) agreed to everything.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do what you choose, if it amuses you.
<p/>I'm happy, and my happiness can be no greater and no less for anything you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) told Kitty of Stepan Arkadyevitch's advice that they should go abroad, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was much surprised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not agree to this, and had some definite requirements of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own in regard to their future.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knew Levin had work he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) loved in the country.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw, understand this work, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not even care to understand it.
<p/>But that did not prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) from regarding it as a matter of great importance.
<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knew their home would be in the country, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wanted to go, not abroad where she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was not going to live, but to the place where their home would be.
<p/>This definitely expressed purpose astonished Levin.
<p/>But since he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not care either way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) immediately asked Stepan Arkadyevitch, as though it were his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) duty, to go down to the country and to arrange everything there to the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ability with the taste of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had so much.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>Stepan Arkadyevitch said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) one day after he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had come back from the country, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had got everything ready for the young people's arrival, <div class="bookquote">``have you a certificate of having been at confession?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.
<p/>But what of it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't be married without it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' A√Øe, a√Øe, a√Øe! ''
<p/>cried Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I believe it's nine years since I've taken the sacrament!
<p/>I never thought of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a pretty fellow!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch laughing, <div class="bookquote">``and you call me a Nihilist!
<p/>But this won't do, you know.
<p/>You must take the sacrament.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When?
<p/>There are four days left now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch arranged this also, and Levin had to go to confession.
<p/>To Levin, as to any unbeliever who respects the beliefs of others, it was exceedingly disagreeable to be present at and take part in church ceremonies.
<p/>At this moment, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) present softened state of feeling, sensitive to everything, this inevitable act of hypocrisy was not merely painful to Levin, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) utterly impossible.
<p/>Now, in the heyday of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) highest glory, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fullest flower, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would have to be a liar or a scoffer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt incapable of being either.
<p/>But though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) repeatedly plied Stepan Arkadyevitch with questions as to the possibility of obtaining a certificate without actually communicating, Stepan Arkadyevitch maintained that it was out of the question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides, what is it to you--two days?
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s an awfully nice clever old fellow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'ll pull the tooth out for you so gently, you won't notice it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Standing at the first litany, Levin attempted to revive in himself his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) youthful recollections of the intense religious emotion he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had passed through between the ages of sixteen and seventeen.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was at once convinced that it was utterly impossible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) attempted to look at it all as an empty custom, having no sort of meaning, like the custom of paying calls.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not do that either.
<p/>Levin found himself, like the majority of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) contemporaries, in the vaguest position in regard to religion.
<p/>Believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not, and at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had no firm conviction that it was all wrong.
<p/>And consequently, not being able to believe in the significance of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was doing nor to regard it with indifference as an empty formality, during the whole period of preparing for the sacrament he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was conscious of a feeling of discomfort and shame at doing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not himself understand, and what, as an inner voice told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), was therefore false and wrong.
<p/>During the service he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would first listen to the prayers, trying to attach some meaning to them not discordant with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own views; then feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not understand and must condemn them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tried not to listen to them, but to attend to the thoughts, observations, and memories which floated through his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brain with extreme vividness during this idle time of standing in church.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had stood through the litany, the evening service and the midnight service, and the next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) got up earlier than usual, and without having tea went at eight o'clock in the morning to the church for the morning service and the confession.
<p/>There was no one in the church but a beggar soldier, two old women, and the church officials.
<p/>A young deacon, whose long back showed in two distinct halves through his (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) thin undercassock, met him (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>), and at once going to a little table at the wall read the exhortation.
<p/>During the reading, especially at the frequent and rapid repetition of the same words, <div class="bookquote">``Lord, have mercy on us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>which resounded with an echo, Levin felt that thought was shut and sealed up, and that it must not be touched or stirred now or confusion would be the result; and so standing behind the deacon he (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) went on thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) own affairs, neither listening nor examining what was said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's wonderful what expression there is in her (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) thought, remembering how they had been sitting the day before at a corner table.
<p/>They had nothing to talk about, as was almost always the case at this time, and laying her (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) hand on the table she (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) kept opening and shutting it, and laughed herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) action.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) remembered how he (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) had kissed it and then had examined the lines on the pink palm.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have mercy on us again!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Levin, crossing himself, bowing, and looking at the supple spring of the deacon's back bowing before him (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) took my hand then and examined the lines `You've got a splendid hand,' she (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) said.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) own hand and the short hand of the deacon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, now it will soon be over,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it seems to be beginning again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) thought, listening to the prayers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's just ending: there he (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) is bowing down to the ground.
<p/>That's always at the end.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The deacon</b></font>)</div><p/>The deacon's hand in a plush cuff accepted a three-rouble note unobtrusively, and the deacon said he (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) would put it down in the register, and his (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) new boots creaking jauntily over the flagstones of the empty church, he (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) went to the altar.
<p/>A moment later he (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) peeped out thence and beckoned to Levin.
<p/>Thought, till then locked up, began to stir in Levin's head, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) made haste to drive it away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will come right somehow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought, and went towards the altar-rails.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went up the steps, and turning to the right saw the priest.
<p/>The priest, a little old man with a scanty grizzled beard and weary, good-natured eyes, was standing at the altar-rails, turning over the pages of a missal.
<p/>With a slight bow to Levin he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began immediately reading prayers in the official voice.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had finished them he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bowed down to the ground and turned, facing Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Christ is present here unseen, receiving your confession,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) said, pointing to the crucifix.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you believe in all the doctrines of the Holy Apostolic Church?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div><p/>the priest went on, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) eyes away from Levin's face and folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands under his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stole.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have doubted, I doubt everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin in a voice that jarred on himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ceased speaking.
<p/>The priest waited a few seconds to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) would not say more, and closing his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) said quickly, with a broad, Vladimirsky accent:  <div class="bookquote">``Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind, but we must pray that God in His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mercy will strengthen us.
<p/>What are your special sins?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) added, without the slightest interval, as though anxious not to waste time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My chief sin is doubt.
<p/>I have doubts of everything, and for the most part I am in doubt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>the priest repeated the same words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you doubt about principally?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt of everything.
<p/>I sometimes even have doubts of the existence of God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin could not help saying, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was horrified at the impropriety of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was saying.
<p/>But Levin's words did not, it seemed, make much impression on the priest.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of doubt can there be of the existence of God?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said hurriedly, with a just perceptible smile.
<p/>Levin did not speak.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What doubt can you have of the Creator when you behold His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) creation?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div><p/>the priest went on in the rapid customary jargon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who has decked the heavenly firmament with its lights?
<p/>Who has clothed the earth in its beauty?
<p/>How explain it without the Creator?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) said, looking inquiringly at Levin.
<p/>Levin felt that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical discussion with the priest, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said in reply merely what was a direct answer to the question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know!
<p/>Then how can you doubt that God created all?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div><p/>the priest said, with good-humored perplexity.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand it at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, blushing, and feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) words were stupid, and that they could not be anything but stupid in such a position.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray to God and beseech Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>Even the holy fathers had doubts, and prayed to God to strengthen their faith.
<p/>The devil has great power, and we must resist him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>).
<p/>Pray to God, beseech Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>Pray to God,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) repeated hurriedly.
<p/>The priest paused for some time, as though meditating.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're about, I hear, to marry the daughter of my parishioner and son in the spirit, Prince Shtcherbatsky?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatsky</b></font>) resumed, with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An excellent young lady.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin, blushing for the priest.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) want to ask me about this at confession for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought.
<p/>And, as though answering his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought, the priest said to him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>):  <div class="bookquote">``You are about to enter into holy matrimony, and God may bless you with offspring.
<p/>Well, what sort of bringing-up can you give your babes if you do not overcome the temptation of the devil, enticing you to infidelity?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) said, with gentle reproachfulness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you love your child as a good father, you will not desire only wealth, luxury, honor for your infant; you will be anxious for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) salvation, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spiritual enlightenment with the light of truth.
<p/>Eh?
<p/>What answer will you make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) when the innocent babe asks you: `Papa!
<p/>who made all that enchants me in this world--the earth, the waters, the sun, the flowers, the grass?'
<p/>Can you say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>): 'I don't know'?
<p/>You cannot but know, since the Lord God in His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) infinite mercy has revealed it to us.
<p/>Or your child will ask you: `What awaits me in the life beyond the tomb?'
<p/>What will you say to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) when you know nothing?
<p/>How will you answer him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?
<p/>Will you leave him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to the allurements of the world and the devil?
<p/>That's not right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) stopped, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) head on one side and looking at Levin with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) kindly, gentle eyes.
<p/>Levin made no answer this time, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not want to enter upon a discussion with the priest, but because, so far, no one had ever asked him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) such questions, and when his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) babes did ask him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) those questions, it would be time enough to think about answering them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are entering upon a time of life,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>pursued the priest, <div class="bookquote">``when you must choose your path and keep to it.
<p/>Pray to God that He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) may in His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mercy aid you and have mercy on you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) concluded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, in the abundance and riches of His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lovingkindness, forgives this child...''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>and, finishing the prayer of absolution, the priest blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) and dismissed him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>).
<p/>On getting home that day, Levin had a delightful sense of relief at the awkward position being over and having been got through without his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) having to tell a lie.
<p/>Apart from this, there remained a vague memory that what the kind, nice old fellow had said had not been at all so stupid as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had fancied at first, and that there was something in it that must be cleared up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, not now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>thought Levin, <div class="bookquote">``but some day later on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin felt more than ever now that there was something not clear and not clean in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) soul, and that, in regard to religion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was in the same position which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) perceived so clearly and disliked in others, and for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) blamed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) friend Sviazhsky.
<p/>Levin spent that evening with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) betrothed at Dolly's, and was in very high spirits.
<p/>To explain to Stepan Arkadyevitch the state of excitement in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) found himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was happy like a dog being trained to jump through a hoop, who, having at last caught the idea, and done what was required of him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), whines and wags its tail, and jumps up to the table and the windows in its delight.
<p/>Chapter 2   On the day of the wedding, according to the Russian custom -LRB-the princess and Darya Alexandrovna insisted on strictly keeping all the customs-RRB-, Levin did not see his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) betrothed, and dined at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hotel with three bachelor friends, casually brought together at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) rooms.
<p/>These were Sergey Ivanovitch, Katavasov, a university friend, now professor of natural science, whom Levin had met in the street and insisted on taking home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and Tchirikov, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) best man, a Moscow conciliation-board judge, Levin's companion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bear-hunts.
<p/>The dinner was a very merry one: Sergey Ivanovitch was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) happiest mood, and was much amused by Katavasov's originality.
<p/>Katavasov, feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) originality was appreciated and understood, made the most of it.
<p/>Tchirikov always gave a lively and good-humored support to conversation of any sort.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``See, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div>said Katavasov, drawling his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) words from a habit acquired in the lecture-room, <div class="bookquote">``what a capable fellow was our friend Konstantin Dmitrievitch.
<p/>I'm not speaking of present company, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>)'s absent.
<p/>At the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) left the university he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) was fond of science, took an interest in humanity; now one-half of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) abilities is devoted to deceiving himself, and the other to justifying the deceit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A more determined enemy of matrimony than you I never saw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, I'm not an enemy of matrimony.
<p/>I'm in favor of division of labor.
<p/>People who can do nothing else ought to rear people while the rest work for their happiness and enlightenment.
<p/>That's how I look at it.
<p/>To muddle up two trades is the error of the amateur; I'm not one of their number.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How happy I shall be when I hear that you're in love!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please invite me to the wedding.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm in love now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, with a cuttlefish!
<p/>You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, <div class="bookquote">``Mihail Semyonovitch is writing a work on the digestive organs of the...''   (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now, make a muddle of it!
<p/>It doesn't matter what about.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The cuttlefish is no hindrance.
<p/>The wife is the hindrance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you'll see!
<p/>You care about farming, hunting,--well, you'd better look out!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Arhip was here today; he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said there were a lot of elks in Prudno, and two bears,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tchirikov</b></font>)</div>said Tchirikov.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you must go and get them without me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you may say good-bye to bear-hunting for the future--your wife won't allow it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin smiled.
<p/>The picture of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife not letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) go was so pleasant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was ready to renounce the delights of looking upon bears forever.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, it's a pity they should get those two bears without you.
<p/>Do you remember last time at Hapilovo?
<p/>That was a delightful hunt!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tchirikov</b></font>)</div><p/>said Tchirikov.
<p/>Levin had not the heart to disillusion him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) of the notion that there could be something delightful apart from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and so said nothing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's some sense in this custom of saying good-bye to bachelor life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``However happy you may be, you must regret your freedom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And confess there is a feeling that you want to jump out of the window, like Gogol's bridegroom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course there is, but it isn't confessed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div>said Katavasov, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gogol</b></font>) broke into loud laughter.

<p/>And here let them do what they like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tchirikov</b></font>)</div>said Tchirikov, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now, on my honor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``I can't find in my heart that feeling of regret for my freedom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; if so, I should have felt a little, apart from my feeling''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not say love before them-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``and happiness, a certain regret at losing my freedom....

 (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div><p/>said Katavasov.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let's drink to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) recovery, or wish that a hundredth part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dreams may be realized--and that would be happiness such as never has been seen on earth!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the guests</b></font>)</div><p/>Soon after dinner the guests went away to be in time to be dressed for the wedding.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was left alone, and recalled the conversation of these bachelor friends, Levin asked himself: had he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart that regret for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) freedom of which they had spoken?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) smiled at the question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Freedom!
<p/>What is freedom for?
<p/>Happiness is only in loving and wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) wishes, thinking her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) thoughts, that is to say, not freedom at all--that's happiness!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But do I know her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) ideas, her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) wishes, her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) feelings?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>some voice suddenly whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>The smile died away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) grew thoughtful.
<p/>And suddenly a strange feeling came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>There came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) a dread and doubt--doubt of everything.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What if she (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) does not love me?
<p/>What if she (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>)'s marrying me simply to be married?
<p/>What if she (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) doesn't see herself what she (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>)'s doing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) asked himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) may come to her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) senses, and only when she (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) is being married realize that she (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) does not and cannot love me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And strange, most evil thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) began to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was jealous of Vronsky, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been a year ago, as though the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) with Vronsky had been yesterday.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) suspected she (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) had not told him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) everything.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) jumped up quickly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, this can't go on!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said to himself in despair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go to her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>); I'll ask her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>); I'll say for the last time: we are free, and hadn't we better stay so?
<p/>Anything's better than endless misery, disgrace, unfaithfulness!''
 (<font color='red'><b>all men</b></font>)</div><p/>With despair in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) heart and bitter anger against all men, against himself, against her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) went out of the hotel and drove to her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) in one of the back rooms.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) was sitting on a chest and making some arrangements with her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) maid, sorting over heaps of dresses of different colors, spread on the backs of chairs and on the floor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) cried, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), and beaming with delight.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-These latter days she (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) used these names almost alternately.-RRB-

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) said gloomily, looking at the maid.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can go, Dunyasha, I'll call you presently,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kostya, what's the matter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) asked, definitely adopting this familiar name as soon as the maid had gone out.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) noticed his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) strange face, agitated and gloomy, and a panic came over her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kitty!
<p/>I'm in torture.
<p/>I can't suffer alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) said with despair in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) voice, standing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) and looking imploringly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) saw already from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) loving, truthful face, that nothing could come of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) had meant to say, but yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to reassure him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come to say that there's still time.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I have said a thousand times over, and can't help thinking ...that I'm not worthy of you.

<p/>You can't love me....
<p/>If...better say so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) said, not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be wretched.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if you don't love me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're out of your mind!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cried, turning crimson with vexation.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) face was so piteous, that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) vexation, and flinging some clothes off an arm-chair, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sat down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you thinking?
<p/>tell me all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am thinking you can't love me.
<p/>What can you love me for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My God!

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, and burst into tears.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>what have I done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cried, and kneeling before her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fell to kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hands.
<p/>When the princess came into the room five minutes later, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) found them completely reconciled.
<p/>Kitty had not simply assured him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), but had gone so far--in answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) question, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) for--as to explain what for.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) understood him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) completely, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would like, and because everything he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) liked was good.
<p/>And this seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) perfectly clear.
<p/>When the princess came to them, they were sitting side by side on the chest, sorting the dresses and disputing over Kitty's wanting to give Dunyasha the brown dress she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had been wearing when Levin proposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) insisted that that dress must never be given away, but Dunyasha must have the blue one.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is it you don't see?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)'s a brunette, and it won't suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)....
<p/>I've worked it all out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Hearing why he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had come, the princess was half humorously, half seriously angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) home to dress and not to hinder Kitty's hair-dressing, as Charles the hair-dresser was just coming.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``As it is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)'s been eating nothing lately and is losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) looks, and then you must come and upset her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) with your nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get along with you, my dear!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin, guilty and shamefaced, but pacified, went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hotel.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, Darya Alexandrovna, and Stepan Arkadyevitch, all in full dress, were waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to bless him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with the holy picture.
<p/>There was no time to lose.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna had to drive home again to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) curled and pomaded son, who was to carry the holy pictures after the bride.
<p/>Then a carriage had to be sent for the best man, and another that would take Sergey Ivanovitch away would have to be sent back....
<p/>Altogether there were a great many most complicated matters to be considered and arranged.
<p/>One thing was unmistakable, that there must be no delay, as it was already half-past six.
<p/>Nothing special happened at the ceremony of benediction with the holy picture.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch stood in a comically solemn pose beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) wife, took the holy picture, and telling Levin to bow down to the ground, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) kindly, ironical smile, and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) three times; Darya Alexandrovna did the same, and immediately was in a hurry to get off, and again plunged into the intricate question of the destinations of the various carriages.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, I'll tell you how we'll manage: you drive in our carriage to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and Sergey Ivanovitch, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>)'ll be so good, will drive there and then send his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) carriage.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course; I shall be delighted.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll come on directly with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Are your things sent off?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) told Kouzma to put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) clothes for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to dress.
<p/>Chapter 3   A crowd of people, principally women, was thronging round the church lighted up for the wedding.
<p/>Those who had not succeeded in getting into the main entrance were crowding about the windows, pushing, wrangling, and peeping through the gratings.
<p/>More than twenty carriages had already been drawn up in ranks along the street by the police.
<p/>A police officer, regardless of the frost, stood at the entrance, gorgeous in his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) uniform.
<p/>More carriages were continually driving up, and ladies wearing flowers and carrying their trains, and men taking off their helmets or black hats kept walking into the church.
<p/>Inside the church both lusters were already lighted, and all the candles before the holy pictures.
<p/>The gilt on the red ground of the holy picture-stand, and the gilt relief on the pictures, and the silver of the lusters and candlesticks, and the stones of the floor, and the rugs, and the banners above in the choir, and the steps of the altar, and the old blackened books, and the cassocks and surplices--all were flooded with light.
<p/>On the right side of the warm church, in the crowd of frock coats and white ties, uniforms and broadcloth, velvet, satin, hair and flowers, bare shoulders and arms and long gloves, there was discreet but lively conversation that echoed strangely in the high cupola.
<p/>Every time there was heard the creak of the opened door the conversation in the crowd died away, and everybody looked round expecting to see the bride and bridegroom come in.
<p/>But the door had opened more than ten times, and each time it was either a belated guest or guests, who joined the circle of the invited on the right, or a spectator, who had eluded or softened the police officer, and went to join the crowd of outsiders on the left.
<p/>Both the guests and the outside public had by now passed through all the phases of anticipation.
<p/>At first they imagined that the bride and bridegroom would arrive immediately, and attached no importance at all to their being late.
<p/>Then they began to look more and more often towards the door, and to talk of whether anything could have happened.
<p/>Then the long delay began to be positively discomforting, and relations and guests tried to look as if they were not thinking of the bridegroom but were engrossed in conversation.
<p/>The head deacon, as though to remind them of the value of his (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) time, coughed impatiently, making the window-panes quiver in their frames.
<p/>In the choir the bored choristers could be heard trying their voices and blowing their noses.
<p/>The priest was continually sending first the beadle and then the deacon to find out whether the bridegroom had not come, more and more often he (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) went himself, in a lilac vestment and an embroidered sash, to the side door, expecting to see the bridegroom.
<p/>At last one of the ladies, glancing at her (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) watch, said, <div class="bookquote">``It really is strange, though!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>and all the guests became uneasy and began loudly expressing their wonder and dissatisfaction.
<p/>One of the bridegroom's best men went to find out what had happened.
<p/>Kitty meanwhile had long ago been quite ready, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) white dress and long veil and wreath of orange blossoms she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was standing in the drawing-room of the Shtcherbatskys' house with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sister, Madame Lvova, who was her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) bridal-mother.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was looking out of the window, and had been for over half an hour anxiously expecting to hear from the best man that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) bridegroom was at the church.
<p/>Levin meanwhile, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) trousers, but without his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) coat and waistcoat, was walking to and fro in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) room at the hotel, continually putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head out of the door and looking up and down the corridor.
<p/>But in the corridor there was no sign of the person he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was looking for and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) came back in despair, and frantically waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands addressed Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was smoking serenely.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was ever a man in such a fearful fool's position?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is stupid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>Stepan Arkadyevitch assented, smiling soothingly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't worry, it'll be brought directly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, what is to be done!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, with smothered fury.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And these fools of open waistcoats!
<p/>Out of the question!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, looking at the crumpled front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shirt.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what if the things have been taken on to the railway station!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) roared in desperation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you must put on mine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to have done so long ago, if at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not nice to look ridiculous....
<p/>Wait a bit!
<p/>it will come round .''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>The point was that when Levin asked for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) evening suit, Kouzma, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) old servant, had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) the coat, waistcoat, and everything that was wanted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the shirt!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got a shirt on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kouzma</b></font>)</div>Kouzma answered, with a placid smile.
<p/>Kouzma had not thought of leaving out a clean shirt, and on receiving instructions to pack up everything and send it round to the Shtcherbatskys' house, from which the young people were to set out the same evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had done so, packing everything but the dress suit.
<p/>The shirt worn since the morning was crumpled and out of the question with the fashionable open waistcoat.
<p/>It was a long way to send to the Shtcherbatskys'.
<p/>They sent out to buy a shirt.
<p/>The servant came back; everything was shut up--it was Sunday.
<p/>They sent to Stepan Arkadyevitch's and brought a shirt--it was impossibly wide and short.
<p/>They sent finally to the Shtcherbatskys' to unpack the things.
<p/>The bridegroom was expected at the church while he (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) was pacing up and down his (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) room like a wild beast in a cage, peeping out into the corridor, and with horror and despair recalling what absurd things he (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) had said to Kitty and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) might be thinking now.
<p/>At last the guilty Kouzma flew panting into the room with the shirt.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only just in time.
<p/>They were just lifting it into the van,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kouzma</b></font>)</div>said Kouzma.
<p/>Three minutes later Levin ran full speed into the corridor, not looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) watch for fear of aggravating his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sufferings.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't help matters like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a smile, hurrying with more deliberation after him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will come round, it will come round...I tell you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 4   <div class="bookquote">``They've come!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which one?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather young, eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear soul, she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looks more dead than alive!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>were the comments in the crowd, when Levin, meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bride in the entrance, walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) into the church.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch told his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife the cause of the delay, and the guests were whispering it with smiles to one another.
<p/>Levin saw nothing and no one; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not take his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes off his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bride.
<p/>Everyone said she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) looks dreadfully of late, and was not nearly so pretty on her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) wedding day as usual; but Levin did not think so.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) hair done up high, with the long white veil and white flowers and the high, stand-up, scalloped collar, that in such a maidenly fashion hid her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) long neck at the sides and only showed it in front, her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) strikingly slender figure, and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) looked better than ever--not because these flowers, this veil, this gown from Paris added anything to her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) beauty; but because, in spite of the elaborate sumptuousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) attire, the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) sweet face, of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) eyes, of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) lips was still her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) own characteristic expression of guileless truthfulness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was beginning to think you meant to run away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) said, and smiled to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's so stupid, what happened to me, I'm ashamed to speak of it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, reddening, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was obliged to turn to Sergey Ivanovitch, who came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a pretty story of yours about the shirt!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>said Sergey Ivanovitch, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) head and smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>answered Levin, without an idea of what they were talking about.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Kostya, you have to decide,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch with an air of mock dismay, <div class="bookquote">``a weighty question.
<p/>You are at this moment just in the humor to appreciate all its gravity.
<p/>They ask me, are they to light the candles that have been lighted before or candles that have never been lighted?
<p/>It's a matter of ten roubles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) added, relaxing his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) lips into a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have decided, but I was afraid you might not agree.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin saw it was a joke, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how's it to be then?--unlighted or lighted candles?
<p/>that's the question.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, unlighted.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm very glad.
<p/>The question's decided!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How silly men are, though, in this position,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to Tchirikov, when Levin, after looking absently at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), had moved back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bride.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kitty, mind you're the first to step on the carpet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess Nordston</b></font>)</div>said Countess Nordston, coming up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a nice person!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Nordston</b></font>) said to Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you frightened, eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>an aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>said Marya Dmitrievna, an old aunt.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you cold?
<p/>You're pale.
<p/>Stop a minute, stoop down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty's sister, Madame Lvova, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) plump, handsome arms she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) smilingly set straight the flowers on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) head.
<p/>Dolly came up, tried to say something, but could not speak, cried, and then laughed unnaturally.
<p/>Kitty looked at all of them with the same absent eyes as Levin.
<p/>Meanwhile the officiating clergy had got into their vestments, and the priest and deacon came out to the lectern, which stood in the forepart of the church.
<p/>The priest turned to Levin saying something.
<p/>Levin did not hear what the priest said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take the bride's hand and lead her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) up,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the best man said to Levin.
<p/>It was a long while before Levin could make out what was expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>For a long time they tried to set him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) right and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) begin again--because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) kept taking Kitty by the wrong arm or with the wrong arm--till he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) understood at last that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to do was, without changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) position, to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) right hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) right hand.
<p/>When at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had taken the bride's hand in the correct way, the priest walked a few paces in front of them and stopped at the lectern.
<p/>The crowd of friends and relations moved after them, with a buzz of talk and a rustle of skirts.
<p/>Someone stooped down and pulled out the bride's train.
<p/>The church became so still that the drops of wax could be heard falling from the candles.
<p/>The little old priest in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) ecclesiastical cap, with his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) long silvery-gray locks of hair parted behind his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) ears, was fumbling with something at the lectern, putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) little old hands from under the heavy silver vestment with the gold cross on the back of it.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch approached him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) cautiously, whispered something, and making a sign to Levin, walked back again.
<p/>The priest lighted two candles, wreathed with flowers, and holding them sideways so that the wax dropped slowly from them he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) turned, facing the bridal pair.
<p/>The priest was the same old man that had confessed Levin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looked with weary and melancholy eyes at the bride and bridegroom, sighed, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) right hand out from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) vestment, blessed the bridegroom with it, and also with a shade of solicitous tenderness laid the crossed fingers on the bowed head of Kitty.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gave them the candles, and taking the censer, moved slowly away from them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can it be true?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Levin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looked round at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bride.
<p/>Looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) face in profile, and from the scarcely perceptible quiver of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) lips and eyelashes he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) was aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) did not look round, but the high scalloped collar, that reached her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) little pink ear, trembled faintly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw that a sigh was held back in her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) throat, and the little hand in the long glove shook as it held the candle.
<p/>All the fuss of the shirt, of being late, all the talk of friends and relations, their annoyance, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ludicrous position--all suddenly passed away and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was filled with joy and dread.
<p/>The handsome, stately head-deacon wearing a silver robe and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) curly locks standing out at each side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head, stepped smartly forward, and lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stole on two fingers, stood opposite the priest.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Blessed be the name of the Lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the solemn syllables rang out slowly one after another, setting the air quivering with waves of sound.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Blessed is the name of our God, from the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>the little old priest answered in a submissive, piping voice, still fingering something at the lectern.
<p/>And the full chorus of the unseen choir rose up, filling the whole church, from the windows to the vaulted roof, with broad waves of melody.
<p/>It grew stronger, rested for an instant, and slowly died away.
<p/>They prayed, as they always do, for peace from on high and for salvation, for the Holy Synod, and for the Tsar; they prayed, too, for the servants of God, Konstantin and Ekaterina, now plighting their troth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vouchsafe to them love made perfect, peace and help, O Lord, we beseech Thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>the head deacon</b></font>)</div>the whole church seemed to breathe with the voice of the head deacon.
<p/>Levin heard the words, and they impressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did they guess that it is help, just help that one wants?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought, recalling all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fears and doubts of late.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do I know?
<p/>what can I do in this fearful business,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``without help?
<p/>Yes, it is help I want now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When the deacon had finished the prayer for the Imperial family, the priest turned to the bridal pair with a book: <div class="bookquote">``Eternal God, that joinest together in love them that were separate,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) read in a gentle, piping voice: <div class="bookquote">``who hast ordained the union of holy wedlock that cannot be set asunder, Thou who didst bless Isaac and Rebecca and their descendants, according to Thy Holy Covenant; bless Thy servants, Konstantin and Ekaterina, leading them in the path of all good works.
<p/>For gracious and merciful art Thou, our Lord, and glory be to Thee, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, now and ever shall be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Amen!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>the unseen choir sent rolling again upon the air.
<p/>''`Joinest together in love them that were separate.'
<p/>What deep meaning in those words, and how they correspond with what one feels at this moment,'' thought Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) feeling the same as I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And looking round, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) eyes, and from their expression he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) concluded that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) was understanding it just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was.
<p/>But this was a mistake; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) almost completely missed the meaning of the words of the service; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) had not heard them, in fact.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) could not listen to them and take them in, so strong was the one feeling that filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) breast and grew stronger and stronger.
<p/>That feeling was joy at the completion of the process that for the last month and a half had been going on in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) soul, and had during those six weeks been a joy and a torture to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>).
<p/>On the day when in the drawing room of the house in Arbaty Street she (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) had gone up to him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) brown dress, and given herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) without a word--on that day, at that hour, there took place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) heart a complete severance from all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) old life, and a quite different, new, utterly strange life had begun for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>), while the old life was actually going on as before.
<p/>Those six weeks had for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) been a time of the utmost bliss and the utmost misery.
<p/>All her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) life, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) desires and hopes were concentrated on this one man, still uncomprehended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>), to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) was bound by a feeling of alternate attraction and repulsion, even less comprehended than the man himself, and all the while she (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) was going on living in the outward conditions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) old life.
<p/>Living the old life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) was horrified at herself, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) utter insurmountable callousness to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) own past, to things, to habits, to the people she (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) had loved, who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>)--to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) mother, who was wounded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) indifference, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) kind, tender father, till then dearer than all the world.
<p/>At one moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) was horrified at this indifference, at another she (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) rejoiced at what had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) to this indifference.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) could not frame a thought, not a wish apart from life with this man; but this new life was not yet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) could not even picture it clearly to herself.
<p/>There was only anticipation, the dread and joy of the new and the unknown.
<p/>And now behold--anticipation and uncertainty and remorse at the abandonment of the old life--all was ending, and the new was beginning.
<p/>This new life could not but have terrors for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) inexperience; but, terrible or not, the change had been wrought six weeks before in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) soul, and this was merely the final sanction of what had long been completed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ekaterina</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Turning again to the lectern, the priest with some difficulty took Kitty's little ring, and asking Levin for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand, put it on the first joint of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) finger.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The servant of God, Konstantin, plights his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) troth to the servant of God, Ekaterina.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>And putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) big ring on Kitty's touchingly weak, pink little finger, the priest said the same thing.
<p/>And the bridal pair tried several times to understand what they had to do, and each time made some mistake and were corrected by the priest in a whisper.
<p/>At last, having duly performed the ceremony, having signed the rings with the cross, the priest handed Kitty the big ring, and Levin the little one.
<p/>Again they were puzzled, and passed the rings from hand to hand, still without doing what was expected.
<p/>Dolly, Tchirikov, and Stepan Arkadyevitch stepped forward to set them right.
<p/>There was an interval of hesitation, whispering, and smiles; but the expression of solemn emotion on the faces of the betrothed pair did not change: on the contrary, in their perplexity over their hands they looked more grave and deeply moved than before, and the smile with which Stepan Arkadyevitch whispered to them that now they would each put on their own ring died away on his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) lips.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had a feeling that any smile would jar on them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou who didst from the beginning create male and female,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>the priest read after the exchange of rings, <div class="bookquote">``from Thee woman was given to man to be a helpmeet to him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), and for the procreation of children.
<p/>O Lord, our God, who hast poured down the blessings of Thy Truth according to Thy Holy Covenant upon Thy chosen servants, our fathers, from generation to generation, bless Thy servants Konstantin and Ekaterina, and make their troth fast in faith, and union of hearts, and truth, and love...''   (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>Levin felt more and more that all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ideas of marriage, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dreams of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would order his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) life, were mere childishness, and that it was something he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not understood hitherto, and now understood less than ever, though it was being performed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>The lump in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) throat rose higher and higher, tears that would not be checked came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Chapter 5   In the church there was all  Moscow, all the friends and relations; and  during the ceremony of plighting troth, in the brilliantly lighted church, there was an incessant flow of discreetly subdued talk in the circle of gaily dressed women and girls, and men in white ties, frockcoats, and uniforms.
<p/>The talk was principally kept up by the men, while the women were absorbed in watching every detail of the ceremony, which always means so much to them.
<p/>In the little group nearest to the bride were her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) two sisters: Dolly, and the other one, the self-possessed beauty, Madame Lvova, who had just arrived from abroad.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is it Marie's in lilac, as bad as black, at a wedding?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Korsunskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Madame Korsunskaya.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``With her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) complexion, it's the one salvation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>responded Madame Trubetskaya.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder why they had the wedding in the evening?
<p/>It's like shop-people...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So much prettier.
<p/>I was married in the evening too...''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Korsunskaya</b></font>)</div>answered Madame Korsunskaya, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) sighed, remembering how charming she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been that day, and how absurdly in love her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) husband was, and how different it all was now.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They say if anyone's best man more than ten times, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll never be married.
<p/>I wanted to be for the tenth time, but the post was taken,''  (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div>said Count Siniavin to the pretty Princess Tcharskaya, who had designs on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Princess Tcharskaya only answered with a smile.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) looked at Kitty, thinking how and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would stand with Count Siniavin in Kitty's place, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) would remind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) joke today.
<p/>Shtcherbatsky told the old maid of honor, Madame Nikolaeva, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatsky</b></font>) meant to put the crown on Kitty's chignon for luck.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) ought not to have worn a chignon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Nikolaeva</b></font>)</div>answered Madame Nikolaeva, who had long ago made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mind that if the elderly widower she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was angling for married her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), the wedding should be of the simplest.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like such grandeur.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>Sergey Ivanovitch was talking to Darya Dmitrievna, jestingly assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) that the custom of going away after the wedding was becoming common because newly married people always felt a little ashamed of themselves.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your brother may feel proud of himself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)'s a marvel of sweetness.
<p/>I believe you're envious.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I've got over that, Darya Dmitrievna,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) answered, and a melancholy and serious expression suddenly came over his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch was telling his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister-in-law his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) joke about divorce.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The wreath wants setting straight,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) answered, not hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>)'s lost her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) looks so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess Nordston</b></font>)</div>Countess Nordston said to Madame Lvova.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s not worth her (<font color='blue'><b>Nordston</b></font>) little finger, is he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I like him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) so--not because he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s my future  beau-fr√®re ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Lvova</b></font>)</div>answered Madame Lvova.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how well he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s behaving!
<p/>It's so difficult, too, to look well in such a position, not to be ridiculous.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s not ridiculous, and not affected; one can see he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s moved.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You expected it, I suppose?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Almost.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we shall see which of them will step on the rug first.
<p/>I warned Kitty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will make no difference,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Lvova</b></font>)</div>said Madame Lvova; <div class="bookquote">``we're all obedient wives; it's in our family.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Lvova</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I stepped on the rug before Vassily on purpose.
<p/>And you, Dolly?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly stood beside them; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) heard them, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) did not answer.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was deeply moved.
<p/>The tears stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) could not have spoken without crying.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was rejoicing over Kitty and Levin; going back in thought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own wedding, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) glanced at the radiant figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch, forgot all the present, and remembered only her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own innocent love.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) recalled not herself only, but all her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) women-friends and acquaintances.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) thought of them on the one day of their triumph, when they had stood like Kitty under the wedding crown, with love and hope and dread in their hearts, renouncing the past, and stepping forward into the mysterious future.
<p/>Among the brides that came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) memory, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) thought too of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) darling Anna, of whose proposed divorce she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had just been hearing.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had stood just as innocent in orange flowers and bridal veil.
<p/>And now?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's terribly strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said to herself.
<p/>It was not merely the sisters, the women-friends and female relations of the bride who were following every detail of the ceremony.
<p/>Women who were quite strangers, mere spectators, were watching it excitedly, holding their breath, in fear of losing a single movement or expression of the bride and bridegroom, and angrily not answering, often not hearing, the remarks of the callous men, who kept making joking or irrelevant observations.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why has she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) been crying?

<p/>Awfully rich, they say.
<p/>That's why she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)'s being married to him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, they're a well-matched pair.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Marya Vassilievna, you were making out those fly-away crinolines were not being worn.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pretty dear the bride is--like a lamb decked with flowers!
<p/>Well, say what you will, we women feel for our sister.''
 (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div><p/>Such were the comments in the crowd of gazing women who had succeeded in slipping in at the church doors.
<p/>Chapter 6   When the ceremony of plighting troth was over, the beadle spread before the lectern in the middle of the church a piece of pink silken stuff, the choir sang a complicated and elaborate psalm, in which the bass and tenor sang responses to one another, and the priest turning round pointed the bridal pair to the pink silk rug.
<p/>Though both had often heard a great deal about the saying that the one who steps first on the rug will be the head of the house, neither Levin nor Kitty were capable of recollecting it, as they took the few steps towards it.
<p/>They did not hear the loud remarks and disputes that followed, some maintaining he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had stepped on first, and others that both had stepped on together.
<p/>After the customary questions, whether they desired to enter upon matrimony, and whether they were pledged to anyone else, and their answers, which sounded strange to themselves, a new ceremony began.
<p/>Kitty listened to the words of the prayer, trying to make out their meaning, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not.
<p/>The feeling of triumph and radiant happiness flooded her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) soul more and more as the ceremony went on, and deprived her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) of all power of attention.
<p/>They prayed: <div class="bookquote">``Endow them with continence and fruitfulness, and vouchsafe that their hearts may rejoice looking upon their sons and daughters.''
 (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div><p/>They alluded to God's creation of a wife from Adam's rib <div class="bookquote">``and for this cause a man shall leave father and mother, and cleave unto his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, and they two shall be one flesh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adam</b></font>)</div>and that <div class="bookquote">``this is a great mystery'' (<font color='red'><b>Adam</b></font>)</div>; they prayed that God would make them fruitful and bless them, like Isaac and Rebecca, Joseph, Moses and Zipporah, and that they might look upon their children's children.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all splendid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>thought Kitty, catching the words, <div class="bookquote">``all that's just as it should be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>and a smile of happiness, unconsciously reflected in everyone who looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), beamed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) radiant face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put it on quite,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>voices were heard urging when the priest had put on the wedding crowns and Shtcherbatsky, his (<font color='blue'><b>Shtcherbatsky</b></font>) hand shaking in its three-button glove, held the crown high above her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put it on!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) whispered, smiling.
<p/>Levin looked round at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and was struck by the joyful radiance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face, and unconsciously her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) feeling infected him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) too, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt glad and happy.
<p/>They enjoyed hearing the epistle read, and the roll of the head deacon's voice at the last verse, awaited with such impatience by the outside public.
<p/>They enjoyed drinking out of the shallow cup of warm red wine and water, and they were still more pleased when the priest, flinging back his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) stole and taking both their hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), led them round the lectern to the accompaniment of bass voices chanting <div class="bookquote">``Glory to God.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div><p/>Shtcherbatsky and Tchirikov, supporting the crowns and stumbling over the bride's train, smiling too and seeming delighted at something, were at one moment left behind, at the next treading on the bridal pair as the priest came to a halt.
<p/>The spark of joy kindled in Kitty seemed to have infected everyone in the church.
<p/>It seemed to Levin that the priest and the deacon too wanted to smile just as he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) did.
<p/>Taking the crowns off their heads the priest read the last prayer and congratulated the young people.
<p/>Levin looked at Kitty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had never before seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) look as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was charming with the new radiance of happiness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face.
<p/>Levin longed to say something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not know whether it was all over.
<p/>The priest got him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) difficulty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) smiled his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) kindly smile and said gently, <div class="bookquote">``Kiss your wife, and you kiss your husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and took the candles out of their hands.
<p/>Levin kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) smiling lips with timid care, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arm, and with a new strange sense of closeness, walked out of the church.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not believe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not believe, that it was true.
<p/>It was only when their wondering and timid eyes met that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) believed in it, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that they were one.
<p/>After supper, the same night, the young people left for the country.
<p/>Chapter 7   Vronsky and Anna had been traveling for three months together in Europe.
<p/>They had visited Venice, Rome, and Naples, and had just arrived at a small Italian town where they meant to stay some time.
<p/>A handsome head waiter, with thick pomaded hair parted from the neck upwards, an evening coat, a broad white cambric shirt front, and a bunch of trinkets hanging above his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) rounded stomach, stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) hands in the full curve of his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) pockets, looking contemptuously from under his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) eyelids while he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) gave some frigid reply to a gentleman who had stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>).
<p/>Catching the sound of footsteps coming from the other side of the entry towards the staircase, the head waiter turned round, and seeing the Russian count, who had taken their best rooms, he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) hands out of his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) pockets deferentially, and with a bow informed him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) that a courier had been, and that the business about the palazzo had been arranged.
<p/>The steward was prepared to sign the agreement.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>I'm glad to hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is madame at home or not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame has been out for a walk but has returned now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>answered the waiter.
<p/>Vronsky took off his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) soft, wide-brimmed hat and passed his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) handkerchief over his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) heated brow and hair, which had grown half over his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) ears, and was brushed back covering the bald patch on his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) head.
<p/>And glancing casually at the gentleman, who still stood there gazing intently at him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) would have gone on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This gentleman is a Russian, and was inquiring after you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the head waiter</b></font>)</div>said the head waiter.
<p/>With mingled feelings of annoyance at never being able to get away from acquaintances anywhere, and longing to find some sort of diversion from the monotony of his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) life, Vronsky looked once more at the gentleman, who had retreated and stood still again, and at the same moment a light came into the eyes of both.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Golenishtchev!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Vronsky!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Golenishtchev</b></font>)</div><p/>It really was Golenishtchev, a comrade of Vronsky's in the Corps of Pages.
<p/>In the corps Golenishtchev had belonged to the liberal party; he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) left the corps without entering the army, and had never taken office under the government.
<p/>Vronsky and he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) had gone completely different ways on leaving the corps, and had only met once since.
<p/>At that meeting Vronsky perceived that Golenishtchev had taken up a sort of lofty, intellectually liberal line, and was consequently disposed to look down upon Vronsky's interests and calling in life.
<p/>Hence Vronsky had met him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) with the chilling and haughty manner he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) so well knew how to assume, the meaning of which was: <div class="bookquote">``You may like or dislike my way of life, that's a matter of the most perfect indifference to me; you will have to treat me with respect if you want to know me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Golenishtchev had been contemptuously indifferent to the tone taken by Vronsky.
<p/>This second meeting might have been expected, one would have supposed, to estrange them still more.
<p/>But now they beamed and exclaimed with delight on recognizing one another.
<p/>Vronsky would never have expected to be so pleased to see Golenishtchev, but probably he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was not himself aware how bored he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) forgot the disagreeable impression of their last meeting, and with a face of frank delight held out his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) old comrade.
<p/>The same expression of delight replaced the look of uneasiness on Golenishtchev's face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How glad I am to meet you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vronsky, showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) strong white teeth in a friendly smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard the name Vronsky, but I didn't know which one.
<p/>I'm very, very glad!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go in.
<p/>Come, tell me what you're doing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been living here for two years.
<p/>I'm working.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vronsky, with sympathy; <div class="bookquote">``let's go in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>And with the habit common with Russians, instead of saying in Russian what he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) wanted to keep from the servants, he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) began to speak in French.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know Madame Karenina?
<p/>We are traveling together.
<p/>I am going to see her (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) said in French, carefully scrutinizing Golenishtchev's face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>I did not know''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) did know-RRB-, Golenishtchev answered carelessly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been here long?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) added.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four days,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>Vronsky answered, once more scrutinizing his (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) friend's face intently.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>)'s a decent fellow, and will look at the thing properly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>Vronsky said to himself, catching the significance of Golenishtchev's face and the change of subject.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) to Anna, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) looks at it properly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>During those three months that Vronsky had spent abroad with Anna, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had always on meeting new people asked himself how the new person would look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) relations with Anna, and for the most part, in men, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had met with the <div class="bookquote">``proper''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>way of looking at it.
<p/>But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had been asked, and those who looked at it <div class="bookquote">``properly''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>had been asked, exactly how they did look at it, both he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) and they would have been greatly puzzled to answer.
<p/>In reality, those who in Vronsky's opinion had the <div class="bookquote">``proper''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>view had no sort of view at all, but behaved in general as well-bred persons do behave in regard to all the complex and insoluble problems with which life is encompassed on all sides; they behaved with propriety, avoiding allusions and unpleasant questions.
<p/>They assumed an air of fully comprehending the import and force of the situation, of accepting and even approving of it, but of considering it superfluous and uncalled for to put all this into words.
<p/>Vronsky at once divined that Golenishtchev was of this class, and therefore was doubly pleased to see him (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>).
<p/>And in fact, Golenishtchev's manner to Madame Karenina, when he (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) was taken to call on her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), was all that Vronsky could have desired.
<p/>Obviously without the slightest effort he (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) steered clear of all subjects which might lead to embarrassment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) had never met Anna before, and was struck by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) beauty, and still more by the frankness with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) position.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) blushed when Vronsky brought in Golenishtchev, and he (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) was extremely charmed by this childish blush overspreading her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) candid and handsome face.
<p/>But what he (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) liked particularly was the way in which at once, as though on purpose that there might be no misunderstanding with an outsider, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) called Vronsky simply Alexey, and said they were moving into a house they had just taken, what was here called a palazzo.
<p/>Golenishtchev liked this direct and simple attitude to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own position.
<p/>Looking at Anna's manner of simple-hearted, spirited gaiety, and knowing Alexey Alexandrovitch and Vronsky, Golenishtchev fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) perfectly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) understood what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was utterly unable to understand: how it was that, having made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband wretched, having abandoned him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son and lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) good name, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) yet felt full of spirits, gaiety, and happiness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's in the guide-book,''  (<font color='red'><b>Golenishtchev</b></font>)</div>said Golenishtchev, referring to the palazzo Vronsky had taken.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a first-rate Tintoretto there.
<p/>One of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) latest period.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you what: it's a lovely day, let's go and have another look at it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, addressing Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be very glad to; I'll go and put on my hat.
<p/>Would you say it's hot?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, stopping short in the doorway and looking inquiringly at Vronsky.
<p/>And again a vivid flush overspread her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face.
<p/>Vronsky saw from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not know on what terms he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) cared to be with Golenishtchev, and so was afraid of not behaving as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) would wish.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) looked a long, tender look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not very,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said.
<p/>And it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) understood everything, most of all, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>); and smiling to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) rapid step out at the door.
<p/>The friends glanced at one another, and a look of hesitation came into both faces, as though Golenishtchev, unmistakably admiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), would have liked to say something about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and could not find the right thing to say, while Vronsky desired and dreaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) doing so.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>Vronsky began to start a conversation of some sort; <div class="bookquote">``so you're settled here?
<p/>You're still at the same work, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) went on, recalling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had been told Golenishtchev was writing something.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'm writing the second part of the  Two Elements ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Golenishtchev</b></font>)</div>said Golenishtchev, coloring with pleasure at the question--<div class="bookquote">``that is, to be exact, I am not writing it yet; I am preparing, collecting materials.
<p/>It will be of far wider scope, and will touch on almost all questions.
<p/>We in Russia refuse to see that we are the heirs of Byzantium,''  (<font color='red'><b>Golenishtchev</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) launched into a long and heated explanation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) views.
<p/>Vronsky at the first moment felt embarrassed at not even knowing of the first part of the  Two Elements , of which the author spoke as something well known.
<p/>But as Golenishtchev began to lay down his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) opinions and Vronsky was able to follow them even without knowing the  Two Elements , he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) with some interest, for Golenishtchev spoke well.
<p/>But Vronsky was startled and annoyed by the nervous irascibility with which Golenishtchev talked of the subject that engrossed him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) went on talking, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) eyes glittered more and more angrily; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was more and more hurried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) replies to imaginary opponents, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) face grew more and more excited and worried.
<p/>Remembering Golenishtchev, a thin, lively, good-natured and well-bred boy, always at the head of the class, Vronsky could not make out the reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) irritability, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) did not like it.
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) particularly disliked was that Golenishtchev, a man belonging to a good set, should put himself on a level with some scribbling fellows, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was irritated and angry.
<p/>Was it worth it?
<p/>Vronsky disliked it, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) felt that Golenishtchev was unhappy, and was sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>Unhappiness, almost mental derangement, was visible on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mobile, rather handsome face, while without even noticing Anna's coming in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) went on hurriedly and hotly expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) views.
<p/>When Anna came in in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hat and cape, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lovely hand rapidly swinging her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) parasol, and stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), it was with a feeling of relief that Vronsky broke away from the plaintive eyes of Golenishtchev which fastened persistently upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), and with a fresh rush of love looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) charming companion, full of life and happiness.
<p/>Golenishtchev recovered himself with an effort, and at first was dejected and gloomy, but Anna, disposed to feel friendly with everyone as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was at that time, soon revived his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) spirits by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) direct and lively manner.
<p/>After trying various subjects of conversation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) got him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) upon painting, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) talked very well, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) attentively.
<p/>They walked to the house they had taken, and looked over it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad of one thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna to Golenishtchev when they were on their way back, <div class="bookquote">``Alexey will have a capital  atelier .
<p/>You must certainly take that room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to Vronsky in Russian, using the affectionately familiar form as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw that Golenishtchev would become intimate with them in their isolation, and that there was no need of reserve before him (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you paint?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Golenishtchev</b></font>)</div><p/>said Golenishtchev, turning round quickly to Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I used to study long ago, and now I have begun to do a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, reddening.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) has great talent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna with a delighted smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm no judge, of course.
<p/>But good judges have said the same.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 8   Anna, in that first period of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) emancipation and rapid return to  health, felt herself unpardonably happy and full of the joy of life.
<p/>The thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband's unhappiness did not poison her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) happiness.
<p/>On one side that memory was too awful to be thought of.
<p/>On the other side her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband's unhappiness had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) too much happiness to be regretted.
<p/>The memory of all that had happened after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) illness: her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) reconciliation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband, its breakdown, the news of Vronsky's wound, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) visit, the preparations for divorce, the departure from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband's house, the parting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son--all that seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) like a delirious dream, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had waked up alone with Vronsky abroad.
<p/>The thought of the harm caused to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband aroused in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) a feeling like repulsion, and akin to what a drowning man might feel who has shaken off another man clinging to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>That man did drown.
<p/>It was an evil action, of course, but it was the sole means of escape, and better not to brood over these fearful facts.
<p/>One consolatory reflection upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) conduct had occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) at the first moment of the final rupture, and when now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) recalled all the past, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) remembered that one reflection.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have inevitably made that man wretched,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``but I don't want to profit by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) misery.
<p/>I too am suffering, and shall suffer; I am losing what I prized above everything--I am losing my good name and my son.
<p/>I have done wrong, and so I don't want happiness, I don't want a divorce, and shall suffer from my shame and the separation from my child.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But, however sincerely Anna had meant to suffer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was not suffering.
<p/>Shame there was not.
<p/>With the tact of which both had such a large share, they had succeeded in avoiding Russian ladies abroad, and so had never placed themselves in a false position, and everywhere they had met people who pretended that they perfectly understood their position, far better indeed than they did themselves.
<p/>Separation from the son she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) loved--even that did not cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) anguish in these early days.
<p/>The baby girl-- his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)  child--was so sweet, and had so won Anna's heart, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was all that was left her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), that Anna rarely thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son.
<p/>The desire for life, waxing stronger with recovered health, was so intense, and the conditions of life were so new and pleasant, that Anna felt unpardonably happy.
<p/>The more she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) got to know Vronsky, the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) for himself, and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) complete ownership of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was a continual joy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) presence was always sweet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>All the traits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) character, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) learned to know better and better, were unutterably dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) appearance, changed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) civilian dress, was as fascinating to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) were some young girl in love.
<p/>In everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said, thought, and did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw something particularly noble and elevated.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) adoration of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) indeed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sought and could not find in him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) anything not fine.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dared not show him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own insignificance beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that, knowing this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) might sooner cease to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dreaded nothing now so much as losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) love, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had no grounds for fearing it.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not help being grateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) attitude to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and showing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) appreciated it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), who had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) opinion such a marked aptitude for a political career, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) would have been certain to play a leading part--he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had sacrificed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) ambition for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sake, and never betrayed the slightest regret.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was more lovingly respectful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) than ever, and the constant care that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) should not feel the awkwardness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) position never deserted him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) for a single instant.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), so manly a man, never opposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), had indeed, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), no will of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) own, and was anxious, it seemed, for nothing but to anticipate her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wishes.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not but appreciate this, even though the very intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) solicitude for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), the atmosphere of care with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) surrounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), sometimes weighed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Vronsky, meanwhile, in spite of the complete realization of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had so long desired, was not perfectly happy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) soon felt that the realization of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) desires gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) no more than a grain of sand out of the mountain of happiness he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had expected.
<p/>It showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) the mistake men make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of their desires.
<p/>For a time after joining his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) life to hers, and putting on civilian dress, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had felt all the delight of freedom in general of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had known nothing before, and of freedom in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) love,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was content, but not for long.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was soon aware that there was springing up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) heart a desire for desires-- ennui .
<p/>Without conscious intention he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) began to clutch at every passing caprice, taking it for a desire and an object.
<p/>Sixteen hours of the day must be occupied in some way, since they were living abroad in complete freedom, outside the conditions of social life which filled up time in Petersburg.
<p/>As for the amusements of bachelor existence, which had provided Vronsky with entertainment on previous tours abroad, they could not be thought of, since the sole attempt of the sort had led to a sudden attack of depression in Anna, quite out of proportion with the cause--a late supper with bachelor friends.
<p/>Relations with the society of the place--foreign and Russian--were equally out of the question owing to the irregularity of their position.
<p/>The inspection of objects of interest, apart from the fact that everything had been seen already, had not for Vronsky, a Russian and a sensible man, the immense significance Englishmen are able to attach to that pursuit.
<p/>And just as the hungry stomach eagerly accepts every object it can get, hoping to find nourishment in it, Vronsky quite unconsciously clutched first at politics, then at new books, and then at pictures.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had from a child a taste for painting, and as, not knowing what to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money on, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had begun collecting engravings, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to a stop at painting, began to take interest in it, and concentrated upon it the unoccupied mass of desires which demanded satisfaction.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a ready appreciation of art, and probably, with a taste for imitating art, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) supposed himself to have the real thing essential for an artist, and after hesitating for some time which style of painting to select--religious, historical, realistic, or genre painting--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set to work to paint.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appreciated all kinds, and could have felt inspired by any one of them; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no conception of the possibility of knowing nothing at all of any school of painting, and of being inspired directly by what is within the soul, without caring whether what is painted will belong to any recognized school.
<p/>Since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew nothing of this, and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inspiration, not directly from life, but indirectly from life embodied in art, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inspiration came very quickly and easily, and as quickly and easily came his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) success in painting something very similar to the sort of painting he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was trying to imitate.
<p/>More than any other style he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked the French--graceful and effective--and in that style he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to paint Anna's portrait in Italian costume, and the portrait seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and to everyone who saw it, extremely successful.
<p/>Chapter 9   The old neglected palazzo, with its lofty carved ceilings and frescoes on the walls, with its floors of mosaic, with its heavy yellow stuff curtains on the windows, with its vases on pedestals, and its open fireplaces, its carved doors and gloomy reception rooms, hung with pictures--this palazzo did much, by its very appearance after they had moved into it, to confirm in Vronsky the agreeable illusion that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not so much a Russian country gentleman, a retired army officer, as an enlightened amateur and patron of the arts, himself a modest artist who had renounced the world, his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) connections, and his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) ambition for the sake of the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) loved.
<p/>The pose chosen by Vronsky with their removal into the palazzo was completely successful, and having, through Golenishtchev, made acquaintance with a few interesting people, for a time he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was satisfied.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) painted studies from nature under the guidance of an Italian professor of painting, and studied mediaeval Italian life.
<p/>Mediaeval Italian life so fascinated Vronsky that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) even wore a hat and flung a cloak over his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) shoulder in the mediaeval style, which, indeed, was extremely becoming to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here we live, and know nothing of what's going on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>Vronsky said to Golenishtchev as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) came to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) one morning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen Mihailov's picture?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said, handing him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) a Russian gazette he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had received that morning, and pointing to an article on a Russian artist, living in the very same town, and just finishing a picture which had long been talked about, and had been bought beforehand.
<p/>The article reproached the government and the academy for letting so remarkable an artist be left without encouragement and support.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've seen it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Golenishtchev</b></font>)</div>answered Golenishtchev.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>)'s not without talent, but it's all in a wrong direction.

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And the question of the subject of the picture having brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) favorite theories, Golenishtchev launched forth into a disquisition on it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't understand how they can fall into such a gross mistake.
<p/>Christ always has His (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) definite embodiment in the art of the great masters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should say not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why mine?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``After yours I don't want another portrait.
<p/>Better have one of Annie''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-so she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) baby girl-RRB-.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) added, looking out of the window at the handsome Italian nurse, who was carrying the child out into the garden, and immediately glancing unnoticed at Vronsky.
<p/>The handsome nurse, from whom Vronsky was painting a head for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) picture, was the one hidden grief in Anna's life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) painted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) model, admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) beauty and mediaevalism, and Anna dared not confess to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was afraid of becoming jealous of this nurse, and was for that reason particularly gracious and condescending both to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) little son.
<p/>Vronsky, too, glanced out of the window and into Anna's eyes, and, turning at once to Golenishtchev, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said:  <div class="bookquote">``Do you know this Mihailov?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have met him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s a queer fish, and quite without breeding.
<p/>You know, one of those uncouth new people one's so often coming across nowadays, one of those free-thinkers you know, who are reared  d'embl√©e  in theories of atheism, scepticism, and materialism.
<p/>In former days,''  (<font color='red'><b>Golenishtchev</b></font>)</div>said Golenishtchev, not observing, or not willing to observe, that both Anna and Vronsky wanted to speak, <div class="bookquote">``in former days the free-thinker was a man who had been brought up in ideas of religion, law, and morality, and only through conflict and struggle came to free-thought; but now there has sprung up a new type of born free-thinkers who grow up without even having heard of principles of morality or of religion, of the existence of authorities, who grow up directly in ideas of negation in everything, that is to say, savages.
<p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)'s of that class.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)'s the son, it appears, of some Moscow butler, and has never had any sort of bringing-up.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) got into the academy and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) reputation he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) tried, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)'s no fool, to educate himself.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) turned to what seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) the very source of culture--the magazines.
<p/>In old times, you see, a man who wanted to educate himself--a Frenchman, for instance--would have set to work to study all the classics and theologians and tragedians and historiaris and philosophers, and, you know, all the intellectual work that came in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way.
<p/>But in our day he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes straight for the literature of negation, very quickly assimilates all the extracts of the science of negation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s ready.
<p/>And that's not all--twenty years ago he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have found in that literature traces of conflict with authorities, with the creeds of the ages; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have perceived from this conflict that there was something else; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes at once upon a literature in which the old creeds do not even furnish matter for discussion, but it is stated baldly that there is nothing else--evolution, natural selection, struggle for existence--and that's all.

(<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I tell you what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, who had for a long while been exchanging wary glances with Vronsky, and knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not in the least interested in the education of this artist, but was simply absorbed by the idea of assisting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and ordering a portrait of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I tell you what,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, resolutely interrupting Golenishtchev, who was still talking away, <div class="bookquote">``let's go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Golenishtchev</b></font>)</div><p/>Golenishtchev recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) self-possession and readily agreed.
<p/>But as the artist lived in a remote suburb, it was decided to take the carriage.
<p/>An hour later Anna, with Golenishtchev by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) side and Vronsky on the front seat of the carriage, facing them, drove up to a new ugly house in the remote suburb.
<p/>On learning from the porter's wife, who came out to them, that Mihailov saw visitors at his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) studio, but that at that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) lodging only a couple of steps off, they sent her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) with their cards, asking permission to see his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) picture.
<p/>Chapter 10    The artist Mihailov was, as always, at work when the cards of Count Vronsky and Golenishtchev were brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>).
<p/>In the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had been working in his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) studio at his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) big picture.
<p/>On getting home he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) flew into a rage with his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) wife for not having managed to put off the landlady, who had been asking for money.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've said it to you twenty times, don't enter into details.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let it run so long; it's not my fault.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mihailov</b></font>)</div><p/>Mihailov shrieked, with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) voice, and, stopping his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ears, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went off into his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) working room, the other side of a partition wall, and closed the door after him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Idiotic woman!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said to himself, sat down to the table, and, opening a portfolio, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) set to work at once with peculiar fervor at a sketch he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had begun.
<p/>Never did he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) work with such fervor and success as when things went ill with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) quarreled with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>damn them all!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went on working.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was making a sketch for the figure of a man in a violent rage.
<p/>A sketch had been made before, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was dissatisfied with it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, that one was better...where is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife, and scowling, and not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), asked his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eldest little girl, where was that piece of paper he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had given them?
<p/>The paper with the discarded sketch on it was found, but it was dirty, and spotted with candle-grease.
<p/>Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) took the sketch, laid it on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) table, and, moving a little away, screwing up his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fell to gazing at it.
<p/>All at once he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) smiled and gesticulated gleefully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it!
<p/>that's it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, and, at once picking up the pencil, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) began rapidly drawing.
<p/>The spot of tallow had given the man a new pose.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had sketched this new pose, when all at once he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recalled the face of a shopkeeper of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had bought cigars, a vigorous face with a prominent chin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sketched this very face, this chin on to the figure of the man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laughed aloud with delight.
<p/>The figure from a lifeless imagined thing had become living, and such that it could never be changed.
<p/>That figure lived, and was clearly and unmistakably defined.
<p/>The sketch might be corrected in accordance with the requirements of the figure, the legs, indeed, could and must be put differently, and the position of the left hand must be quite altered; the hair too might be thrown back.
<p/>But in making these corrections he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not altering the figure but simply getting rid of what concealed the figure.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, as it were, stripping off the wrappings which hindered it from being distinctly seen.
<p/>Each new feature only brought out the whole figure in all its force and vigor, as it had suddenly come to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from the spot of tallow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was carefully finishing the figure when the cards were brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Coming, coming!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went in to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Sasha, don't be cross!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, smiling timidly and affectionately at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were to blame.
<p/>I was to blame.
<p/>I'll make it all right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>And having made peace with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put on an olive-green overcoat with a velvet collar and a hat, and went towards his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) studio.
<p/>The successful figure he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had already forgotten.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was delighted and excited at the visit of these people of consequence, Russians, who had come in their carriage.
<p/>Of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) picture, the one that stood now on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) easel, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart one conviction--that no one had ever painted a picture like it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not believe that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) picture was better than all the pictures of Raphael, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raphael</b></font>) knew that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Raphael</b></font>) tried to convey in that picture, no one ever had conveyed.
<p/>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Raphael</b></font>) knew positively, and had known a long while, ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Raphael</b></font>) had begun to paint it.
<p/>But other people's criticisms, whatever they might be, had yet immense consequence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raphael</b></font>) eyes, and they agitated him (<font color='blue'><b>Raphael</b></font>) to the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raphael</b></font>) soul.
<p/>Any remark, the most insignificant, that showed that the critic saw even the tiniest part of what he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) saw in the picture, agitated him (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) to the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) soul.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) always attributed to his (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) critics a more profound comprehension than he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) had himself, and always expected from them something he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) did not himself see in the picture.
<p/>And often in their criticisms he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) had found this.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) walked rapidly to the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) studio, and in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) excitement he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) was struck by the soft light on Anna's figure as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stood in the shade of the entrance listening to Golenishtchev, who was eagerly telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) something, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) evidently wanted to look round at the artist.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was himself unconscious how, as he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) approached them, he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) seized on this impression and absorbed it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had the chin of the shopkeeper who had sold him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) the cigars, and put it away somewhere to be brought out when he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) wanted it.
<p/>The visitors, not agreeably impressed beforehand by Golenishtchev's account of the artist, were still less so by his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) personal appearance.
<p/>Thick-set and of middle height, with nimble movements, with his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) brown hat, olive-green coat and narrow trousers--though wide trousers had been a long while in fashion,--most of all, with the ordinariness of his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) broad face, and the combined expression of timidity and anxiety to keep up his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) dignity, Mihailov made an unpleasant impression.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please step in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) said, trying to look indifferent, and going into the passage he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) took a key out of his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) pocket and opened the door.
<p/>Chapter 11   On entering the studio, Mihailov once more scanned his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) visitors and noted down in his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) imagination Vronsky's expression too, and especially his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) jaws.
<p/>Although his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) artistic sense was unceasingly at work collecting materials, although he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) felt a continually increasing excitement as the moment of criticizing his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) work drew nearer, he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) rapidly and subtly formed, from imperceptible signs, a mental image of these three persons.
<p/>That fellow -LRB-Golenishtchev-RRB- was a Russian living here.
<p/>Mihailov did not remember his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) surname nor where he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had met him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), nor what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) only remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) face as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) remembered all the faces he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had ever seen; but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) remembered, too, that it was one of the faces laid by in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) memory in the immense class of the falsely consequential and poor in expression.
<p/>The abundant hair and very open forehead gave an appearance of consequence to the face, which had only one expression--a petty, childish, peevish expression, concentrated just above the bridge of the narrow nose.
<p/>Vronsky and Madame Karenina must be, Mihailov supposed, distinguished and wealthy Russians, knowing nothing about art, like all those wealthy Russians, but posing as amateurs and connoisseurs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most likely they've already looked at all the antiques, and now they're making the round of the studios of the new people, the German humbug, and the cracked Pre-Raphaelite English fellow, and have only come to me to make the point of view complete,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thought.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was well acquainted with the way dilettanti have -LRB-the cleverer they were the worse he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) found them-RRB- of looking at the works of contemporary artists with the sole object of being in a position to say that art is a thing of the past, and that the more one sees of the new men the more one sees how inimitable the works of the great old masters have remained.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) expected all this; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) saw it all in their faces, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) saw it in the careless indifference with which they talked among themselves, stared at the lay figures and busts, and walked about in leisurely fashion, waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to uncover his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) picture.
<p/>But in spite of this, while he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was turning over his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) studies, pulling up the blinds and taking off the sheet, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was in intense excitement, especially as, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) conviction that all distinguished and wealthy Russians were certain to be beasts and fools, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) liked Vronsky, and still more Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, moving on one side with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) nimble gait and pointing to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) picture, <div class="bookquote">``it's the exhortation to Pilate.
<p/>Matthew, chapter xxvii,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) said, feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) lips were beginning to tremble with emotion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) moved away and stood behind them.
<p/>For the few seconds during which the visitors were gazing at the picture in silence Mihailov too gazed at it with the indifferent eye of an outsider.
<p/>For those few seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) was sure in anticipation that a higher, juster criticism would be uttered by them, by those very visitors whom he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) had been so despising a moment before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) forgot all he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) had thought about his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) picture before during the three years he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) had been painting it; he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) forgot all its qualities which had been absolutely certain to him (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) saw the picture with their indifferent, new, outside eyes, and saw nothing good in it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) saw in the foreground Pilate's irritated face and the serene face of Christ, and in the background the figures of Pilate's retinue and the face of John watching what was happening.
<p/>Every face that, with such agony, such blunders and corrections had grown up within him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) with its special character, every face that had given him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) such torments and such raptures, and all these faces so many times transposed for the sake of the harmony of the whole, all the shades of color and tones that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had attained with such labor--all of this together seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) now, looking at it with their eyes, the merest vulgarity, something that had been done a thousand times over.
<p/>The face dearest to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), the face of Christ, the center of the picture, which had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) such ecstasy as it unfolded itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>), was utterly lost to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) glanced at the picture with their eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) saw a well-painted -LRB-no, not even that--he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) distinctly saw now a mass of defects-RRB- repetition of those endless Christs of Titian, Raphael, Rubens, and the same soldiers and Pilate.
<p/>It was all common, poor, and stale, and positively badly painted--weak and unequal.
<p/>They would be justified in repeating hypocritically civil speeches in the presence of the painter, and pitying him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) and laughing at him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) when they were alone again.
<p/>The silence -LRB-though it lasted no more than a minute-RRB- became too intolerable to him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>).
<p/>To break it, and to show he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) was not agitated, he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) made an effort and addressed Golenishtchev.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I've had the pleasure of meeting you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) said, looking uneasily first at Anna, then at Vronsky, in fear of losing any shade of their expression.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure!
<p/>We met at Rossi's, do you remember, at that  soir√©e  when that Italian lady recited--the new Rachel?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Golenishtchev</b></font>)</div><p/>Golenishtchev answered easily, removing his (<font color='blue'><b>Rossi</b></font>) eyes without the slightest regret from the picture and turning to the artist.
<p/>Noticing, however, that Mihailov was expecting a criticism of the picture, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rossi</b></font>) said:  <div class="bookquote">``Your picture has got on a great deal since I saw it last time; and what strikes me particularly now, as it did then, is the figure of Pilate.
<p/>One so knows the man: a good-natured, capital fellow, but an official through and through, who does not know what it is he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>)'s doing.
<p/>But I fancy...''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>All Mihailov's mobile face beamed at once; his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) eyes sparkled.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) tried to say something, but he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) could not speak for excitement, and pretended to be coughing.
<p/>Low as was his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) opinion of Golenishtchev's capacity for understanding art, trifling as was the true remark upon the fidelity of the expression of Pilate as an official, and offensive as might have seemed the utterance of so unimportant an observation while nothing was said of more serious points, Mihailov was in an ecstasy of delight at this observation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pilate</b></font>) had himself thought about Pilate's figure just what Golenishtchev said.
<p/>The fact that this reflection was but one of millions of reflections, which as Mihailov knew for certain would be true, did not diminish for him (<font color='blue'><b>Pilate</b></font>) the significance of Golenishtchev's remark.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Pilate</b></font>) heart warmed to Golenishtchev for this remark, and from a state of depression he (<font color='blue'><b>Pilate</b></font>) suddenly passed to ecstasy.
<p/>At once the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pilate</b></font>) picture lived before him (<font color='blue'><b>Pilate</b></font>) in all the indescribable complexity of everything living.
<p/>Mihailov again tried to say that that was how he (<font color='blue'><b>Pilate</b></font>) understood Pilate, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Pilate</b></font>) lips quivered intractably, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pilate</b></font>) could not pronounce the words.
<p/>Vronsky and Anna too said something in that subdued voice in which, partly to avoid hurting the artist's feelings and partly to avoid saying out loud something silly--so easily said when talking of art--people usually speak at exhibitions of pictures.
<p/>Mihailov fancied that the picture had made an impression on them too.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) went up to them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How marvelous Christ's expression is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna.
<p/>Of all she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) liked that expression most of all, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that it was the center of the picture, and so praise of it would be pleasant to the artist.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One can see that He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) is pitying Pilate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Christ</b></font>)</div><p/>This again was one of the million true reflections that could be found in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pilate</b></font>) picture and in the figure of Christ.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said that He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was pitying Pilate.
<p/>In Christ's expression there ought to be indeed an expression of pity, since there is an expression of love, of heavenly peace, of readiness for death, and a sense of the vanity of words.
<p/>Of course there is the expression of an official in Pilate and of pity in Christ, seeing that one is the incarnation of the fleshly and the other of the spiritual life.
<p/>All this and much more flashed into Mihailov's thoughts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and how that figure is done--what atmosphere!
<p/>One can walk round it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Golenishtchev</b></font>)</div>said Golenishtchev, unmistakably betraying by this remark that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) did not approve of the meaning and idea of the figure.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there's a wonderful mastery!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How those figures in the background stand out!
<p/>There you have technique,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) said, addressing Golenishtchev, alluding to a conversation between them about Vronsky's despair of attaining this technique.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, marvelous!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Golenishtchev</b></font>)</div><p/>Golenishtchev and Anna assented.
<p/>In spite of the excited condition in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was, the sentence about technique had sent a pang to Mihailov's heart, and looking angrily at Vronsky he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) suddenly scowled.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had often heard this word technique, and was utterly unable to understand what was understood by it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) knew that by this term was understood a mechanical facility for painting or drawing, entirely apart from its subject.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had noticed often that even in actual praise technique was opposed to essential quality, as though one could paint well something that was bad.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) knew that a great deal of attention and care was necessary in taking off the coverings, to avoid injuring the creation itself, and to take off all the coverings; but there was no art of painting--no technique of any sort--about it.
<p/>If to a little child or to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) cook were revealed what he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) saw, it or she (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would have been able to peel the wrappings off what was seen.
<p/>And the most experienced and adroit painter could not by mere mechanical facility paint anything if the lines of the subject were not revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) first.
<p/>Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) saw that if it came to talking about technique, it was impossible to praise him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) for it.
<p/>In all he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) had painted and repainted he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) saw faults that hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) eyes, coming from want of care in taking off the wrappings--faults he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) could not correct now without spoiling the whole.
<p/>And in almost all the figures and faces he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) saw, too, remnants of the wrappings not perfectly removed that spoiled the picture.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One thing might be said, if you will allow me to make the remark...''  (<font color='red'><b>Golenishtchev</b></font>)</div>observed Golenishtchev.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I shall be delighted, I beg you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mihailov</b></font>)</div>said Mihailov with a forced smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is, that you make Him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) the man-god, and not the God-man.
<p/>But I know that was what you meant to do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot paint a Christ that is not in my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mihailov</b></font>)</div>said Mihailov gloomily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but in that case, if you will allow me to say what I think....
<p/>Your picture is so fine that my observation cannot detract from it, and, besides, it is only my personal opinion.
<p/>With you it is different.
<p/>Your very motive is different.
<p/>But let us take Ivanov.
<p/>I imagine that if Christ is brought down to the level of an historical character, it would have been better for Ivanov to select some other historical subject, fresh, untouched.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if this is the greatest subject presented to art?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If one looked one would find others.
<p/>But the point is that art cannot suffer doubt and discussion.
<p/>And before the picture of Ivanov the question arises for the believer and the unbeliever alike, `Is it God, or is it not God?'
<p/>and the unity of the impression is destroyed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so?
<p/>I think that for educated people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mihailov</b></font>)</div>said Mihailov, <div class="bookquote">``the question cannot exist.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mihailov</b></font>)</div><p/>Golenishtchev did not agree with this, and confounded Mihailov by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) support of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) first idea of the unity of the impression being essential to art.
<p/>Mihailov was greatly perturbed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could say nothing in defense of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own idea.
<p/>Chapter 12   Anna and Vronsky had long been exchanging glances, regretting their friend's flow of cleverness.
<p/>At last Vronsky, without waiting for the artist, walked away to another small picture.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how exquisite!
<p/>What a lovely thing!
<p/>A gem!
<p/>How exquisite!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>they cried with one voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it they're so pleased with?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mihailov</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Mihailov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had positively forgotten that picture he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had painted three years ago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had forgotten all the agonies and the ecstasies he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had lived through with that picture when for several months it had been the one thought haunting him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) day and night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had forgotten, as he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) always forgot, the pictures he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had finished.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) did not even like to look at it, and had only brought it out because he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was expecting an Englishman who wanted to buy it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's only an old study,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How fine!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Golenishtchev</b></font>)</div><p/>said Golenishtchev, he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) too, with unmistakable sincerity, falling under the spell of the picture.
<p/>Two boys were angling in the shade of a willow-tree.
<p/>The elder had just dropped in the hook, and was carefully pulling the float from behind a bush, entirely absorbed in what he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was doing.
<p/>The other, a little younger, was lying in the grass leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) elbows, with his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) tangled, flaxen head in his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) hands, staring at the water with his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) dreamy blue eyes.
<p/>What was he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) thinking of?
<p/>The enthusiasm over this picture stirred some of the old feeling for it in Mihailov, but he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) feared and disliked this waste of feeling for things past, and so, even though this praise was grateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) tried to draw his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) visitors away to a third picture.
<p/>But Vronsky asked whether the picture was for sale.
<p/>To Mihailov at that moment, excited by visitors, it was extremely distasteful to speak of money matters.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is put up there to be sold,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) answered, scowling gloomily.
<p/>When the visitors had gone, Mihailov sat down opposite the picture of Pilate and Christ, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) mind went over what had been said, and what, though not said, had been implied by those visitors.
<p/>And, strange to say, what had had such weight with him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>), while they were there and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) mentally put himself at their point of view, suddenly lost all importance for him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) began to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) picture with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) own full artist vision, and was soon in that mood of conviction of the perfectibility, and so of the significance, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) picture--a conviction essential to the most intense fervor, excluding all other interests--in which alone he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) could work.
<p/>Christ's foreshortened leg was not right, though.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) palette and began to work.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) corrected the leg he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) looked continually at the figure of John in the background, which his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) visitors had not even noticed, but which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) knew was beyond perfection.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had finished the leg he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wanted to touch that figure, but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) felt too much excited for it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was equally unable to work when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was cold and when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was too much affected and saw everything too much.
<p/>There was only one stage in the transition from coldness to inspiration, at which work was possible.
<p/>Today he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was too much agitated.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would have covered the picture, but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stopped, holding the cloth in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hand, and, smiling blissfully, gazed a long while at the figure of John.
<p/>At last, as it were regretfully tearing himself away, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) dropped the cloth, and, exhausted but happy, went home.
<p/>Vronsky, Anna, and Golenishtchev, on their way home, were particularly lively and cheerful.
<p/>They talked of Mihailov and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pictures.
<p/>The word  talent , by which they meant an inborn, almost physical, aptitude apart from brain and heart, and in which they tried to find an expression for all the artist had gained from life, recurred particularly often in their talk, as though it were necessary for them to sum up what they had no conception of, though they wanted to talk of it.
<p/>They said that there was no denying his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) talent, but that his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) talent could not develop for want of education--the common defect of our Russian artists.
<p/>But the picture of the boys had imprinted itself on their memories, and they were continually coming back to it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What an exquisite thing!
<p/>How he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) has succeeded in it, and how simply!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) doesn't even comprehend how good it is.
<p/>Yes, I mustn't let it slip; I must buy it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky.
<p/>Chapter 13   Mihailov sold Vronsky his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) picture, and agreed to paint a portrait of Anna.
<p/>On the day fixed he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) came and began the work.
<p/>From the fifth sitting the portrait impressed everyone, especially Vronsky, not only by its resemblance, but by its characteristic beauty.
<p/>It was strange how Mihailov could have discovered just her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) characteristic beauty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One needs to know and love her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as I have loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to discover the very sweetest expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>Vronsky thought, though it was only from this portrait that he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had himself learned this sweetest expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soul.
<p/>But the expression was so true that he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>), and others too, fancied they had long known it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been struggling on for ever so long without doing anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) said of his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) own portrait of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) just looked and painted it.
<p/>That's where technique comes in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will come,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>was the consoling reassurance given him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) by Golenishtchev, in whose view Vronsky had both talent, and what was most important, culture, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) a wider outlook on art.
<p/>Golenishtchev's faith in Vronsky's talent was propped up by his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) own need of Vronsky's sympathy and approval for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) own articles and ideas, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) felt that the praise and support must be mutual.
<p/>In another man's house, and especially in Vronsky's palazzo, Mihailov was quite a different man from what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) studio.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) behaved with hostile courtesy, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were afraid of coming closer to people he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not respect.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called Vronsky <div class="bookquote">``your excellency,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>and notwithstanding Anna's and Vronsky's invitations, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would never stay to dinner, nor come except for the sittings.
<p/>Anna was even more friendly to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) than to other people, and was very grateful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) portrait.
<p/>Vronsky was more than cordial with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and was obviously interested to know the artist's opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) picture.
<p/>Golenishtchev never let slip an opportunity of instilling sound ideas about art into Mihailov.
<p/>But Mihailov remained equally chilly to all of them.
<p/>Anna was aware from his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) eyes that he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) liked looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) avoided conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Vronsky's talk about his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) painting he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) met with stubborn silence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was as stubbornly silent when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was shown Vronsky's picture.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was unmistakably bored by Golenishtchev's conversation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) did not attempt to oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>Altogether Mihailov, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) reserved and disagreeable, as it were, hostile attitude, was quite disliked by them as they got to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) better; and they were glad when the sittings were over, and they were left with a magnificent portrait in their possession, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) gave up coming.
<p/>Golenishtchev was the first to give expression to an idea that had occurred to all of them, which was that Mihailov was simply jealous of Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not envious, let us say, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) has  talent ; but it annoys him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) that a wealthy man of the highest society, and a count, too -LRB-you know they all detest a title-RRB-, can, without any particular trouble, do as well, if not better, than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who has devoted all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life to it.
<p/>And more than all, it's a question of culture, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is without.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky defended Mihailov, but at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed it, because in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) view a man of a different, lower world would be sure to be envious.
<p/>Anna's portrait--the same subject painted from nature both by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and by Mihailov--ought to have shown Vronsky the difference between him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and Mihailov; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not see it.
<p/>Only after Mihailov's portrait was painted he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left off painting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) portrait of Anna, deciding that it was now not needed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) picture of mediaeval life he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on with.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself, and Golenishtchev, and still more Anna, thought it very good, because it was far more like the celebrated pictures they knew than Mihailov's picture.
<p/>Mihailov meanwhile, although Anna's portrait greatly fascinated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), was even more glad than they were when the sittings were over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no longer to listen to Golenishtchev's disquisitions upon art, and could forget about Vronsky's painting.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) knew that Vronsky could not be prevented from amusing himself with painting; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) and all dilettanti had a perfect right to paint what they liked, but it was distasteful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>A man could not be prevented from making himself a big wax doll, and kissing it.
<p/>But if the man were to come with the doll and sit before a man in love, and begin caressing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doll as the lover caressed the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved, it would be distasteful to the lover.
<p/>Just such a distasteful sensation was what Mihailov felt at the sight of Vronsky's painting: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt it both ludicrous and irritating, both pitiable and offensive.
<p/>Vronsky's interest in painting and the Middle Ages did not last long.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had enough taste for painting to be unable to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) picture.
<p/>The picture came to a standstill.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was vaguely aware that its defects, inconspicuous at first, would be glaring if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were to go on with it.
<p/>The same experience befell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as Golenishtchev, who felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had nothing to say, and continually deceived himself with the theory that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) idea was not yet mature, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was working it out and collecting materials.
<p/>This exasperated and tortured Golenishtchev, but Vronsky was incapable of deceiving and torturing himself, and even more incapable of exasperation.
<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) characteristic decision, without explanation or apology, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) simply ceased working at painting.
<p/>But without this occupation, the life of Vronsky and of Anna, who wondered at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) loss of interest in it, struck them as intolerably tedious in an Italian town.
<p/>The palazzo suddenly seemed so obtrusively old and dirty, the spots on the curtains, the cracks in the floors, the broken plaster on the cornices became so disagreeably obvious, and the everlasting sameness of Golenishtchev, and the Italian professor and the German traveler became so wearisome, that they had to make some change.
<p/>They resolved to go to Russia, to the country.
<p/>In Petersburg Vronsky intended to arrange a partition of the land with his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) brother, while Anna meant to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son.
<p/>The summer they intended to spend on Vronsky's great family estate.
<p/>Chapter 14   Levin had been married three months.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was happy, but not at all in the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had expected to be.
<p/>At every step he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) former dreams disappointed, and new, unexpected surprises of happiness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was happy; but on entering upon family life he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw at every step that it was utterly different from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had imagined.
<p/>At every step he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) experienced what a man would experience who, after admiring the smooth, happy course of a little boat on a lake, should get himself into that little boat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw that it was not all sitting still, floating smoothly; that one had to think too, not for an instant to forget where one was floating; and that there was water under one, and that one must row; and that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unaccustomed hands would be sore; and that it was only to look at it that was easy; but that doing it, though very delightful, was very difficult.
<p/>As a bachelor, when he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) had watched other people's married life, seen the petty cares, the squabbles, the jealousy, he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) had only smiled contemptuously in his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) heart.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) future married life there could be, he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) was convinced, nothing of that sort; even the external forms, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) fancied, must be utterly unlike the life of others in everything.
<p/>And all of a sudden, instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) life with his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) wife being made on an individual pattern, it was, on the contrary, entirely made up of the pettiest details, which he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) had so despised before, but which now, by no will of his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) own, had gained an extraordinary importance that it was useless to contend against.
<p/>And Levin saw that the organization of all these details was by no means so easy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had fancied before.
<p/>Although Levin believed himself to have the most exact conceptions of domestic life, unconsciously, like all men, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pictured domestic life as the happiest enjoyment of love, with nothing to hinder and no petty cares to distract.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) conceived the position, to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) work, and to find repose from it in the happiness of love.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ought to be beloved, and nothing more.
<p/>But, like all men, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) forgot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) too would want work.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was surprised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) poetic, exquisite Kitty, could, not merely in the first weeks, but even in the first days of their married life, think, remember, and busy herself about tablecloths, and furniture, about mattresses for visitors, about a tray, about the cook, and the dinner, and so on.
<p/>While they were still engaged, he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) had been struck by the definiteness with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had declined the tour abroad and decided to go into the country, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knew of something she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wanted, and could still think of something outside her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) love.
<p/>This had jarred upon him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) then, and now her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) trivial cares and anxieties jarred upon him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) several times.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) saw that this was essential for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>And, loving her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) did, though he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) did not understand the reason of them, and jeered at these domestic pursuits, he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) could not help admiring them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) jeered at the way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) arranged the furniture they had brought from Moscow; rearranged their room; hung up curtains; prepared rooms for visitors; a room for Dolly; saw after an abode for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) new maid; ordered dinner of the old cook; came into collision with Agafea Mihalovna, taking from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) the charge of the stores.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) saw how the old cook smiled, admiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), and listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) inexperienced, impossible orders, how mournfully and tenderly Agafea Mihalovna shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) head over the young mistress's new arrangements.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) saw that Kitty was extraordinarily sweet when, laughing and crying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) came to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) maid, Masha, was used to looking upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) young lady, and so no one obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) sweet, but strange, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) thought it would have been better without this.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) did not know how great a sense of change she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was experiencing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), who at home had sometimes wanted some favorite dish, or sweets, without the possibility of getting either, now could order what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) liked, buy pounds of sweets, spend as much money as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) liked, and order any puddings she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) pleased.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was dreaming with delight now of Dolly's coming to them with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) children, especially because she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) would order for the children their favorite puddings and Dolly would appreciate all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) new housekeeping.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) did not know herself why and wherefore, but the arranging of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) house had an irresistible attraction for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/>Instinctively feeling the approach of spring, and knowing that there would be days of rough weather too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) built her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) nest as best she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) could, and was in haste at the same time to build it and to learn how to do it.
<p/>This care for domestic details in Kitty, so opposed to Levin's ideal of exalted happiness, was at first one of the disappointments; and this sweet care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) household, the aim of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not understand, but could not help loving, was one of the new happy surprises.
<p/>Another disappointment and happy surprise came in their quarrels.
<p/>Levin could never have conceived that between him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife any relations could arise other than tender, respectful and loving, and all at once in the very early days they quarreled, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not care for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) cared for no one but himself, burst into tears, and wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arms.
<p/>This first quarrel arose from Levin's having gone out to a new farmhouse and having been away half an hour too long, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had tried to get home by a short cut and had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drove home thinking of nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) love, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own happiness, and the nearer he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drew to home, the warmer was his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tenderness for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ran into the room with the same feeling, with an even stronger feeling than he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had had when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) reached the Shtcherbatskys' house to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) offer.
<p/>And suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was met by a lowering expression he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had never seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would have kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been enjoying yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) began, trying to be calm and spiteful.
<p/>But as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mouth, a stream of reproach, of senseless jealousy, of all that had been torturing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) during that half hour which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had spent sitting motionless at the window, burst from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>It was only then, for the first time, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) clearly understood what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not understood when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) out of the church after the wedding.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not simply close to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ended and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) began.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt this from the agonizing sensation of division that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) experienced at that instant.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was offended for the first instant, but the very same second he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not be offended by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt for the first moment as a man feels when, having suddenly received a violent blow from behind, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turns round, angry and eager to avenge himself, to look for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) antagonist, and finds that it is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself who has accidentally struck himself, that there is no one to be angry with, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must put up with and try to soothe the pain.
<p/>Never afterwards did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feel it with such intensity, but this first time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not for a long while get over it.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) natural feeling urged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to defend himself, to prove to her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) was wrong; but to prove her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) wrong would mean irritating her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) still more and making the rupture greater that was the cause of all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suffering.
<p/>One habitual feeling impelled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to get rid of the blame and to pass it on to her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>).
<p/>Another feeling, even stronger, impelled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as quickly as possible to smooth over the rupture without letting it grow greater.
<p/>To remain under such undeserved reproach was wretched, but to make her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) suffer by justifying himself was worse still.
<p/>Like a man half-awake in an agony of pain, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to tear out, to fling away the aching place, and coming to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that the aching place was himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could do nothing but try to help the aching place to bear it, and this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to do.
<p/>They made peace.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>), recognizing that she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) was wrong, though she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) did not say so, became tenderer to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and they experienced new, redoubled happiness in their love.
<p/>But that did not prevent such quarrels from happening again, and exceedingly often too, on the most unexpected and trivial grounds.
<p/>These quarrels frequently arose from the fact that they did not yet know what was of importance to each other and that all this early period they were both often in a bad temper.
<p/>When one was in a good temper, and the other in a bad temper, the peace was not broken; but when both happened to be in an ill-humor, quarrels sprang up from such incomprehensibly trifling causes, that they could never remember afterwards what they had quarreled about.
<p/>It is true that when they were both in a good temper their enjoyment of life was redoubled.
<p/>But still this first period of their married life was a difficult time for them.
<p/>During all this early time they had a peculiarly vivid sense of tension, as it were, a tugging in opposite directions of the chain by which they were bound.
<p/>Altogether their honeymoon--that is to say, the month after their wedding--from which from tradition Levin expected so much, was not merely not a time of sweetness, but remained in the memories of both as the bitterest and most humiliating period in their lives.
<p/>They both alike tried in later life to blot out from their memories all the monstrous, shameful incidents of that morbid period, when both were rarely in a normal frame of mind, both were rarely quite themselves.
<p/>It was only in the third month of their married life, after their return from Moscow, where they had been staying for a month, that their life began to go more smoothly.
<p/>Chapter 15   They had just come back from Moscow, and were glad to be alone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was sitting at the writing table in his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) study, writing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), wearing the dark lilac dress she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had worn during the first days of their married life, and put on again today, a dress particularly remembered and loved by him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>), was sitting on the sofa, the same old-fashioned leather sofa which had always stood in the study in Levin's father's and grandfather's days.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was sewing at  broderie anglaise .
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought and wrote, never losing the happy consciousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) presence.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) work, both on the land and on the book, in which the principles of the new land system were to be laid down, had not been abandoned; but just as formerly these pursuits and ideas had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) petty and trivial in comparison with the darkness that overspread all life, now they seemed as unimportant and petty in comparison with the life that lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) suffused with the brilliant light of happiness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) work, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt now that the center of gravity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) attention had passed to something else, and that consequently he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) work quite differently and more clearly.
<p/>Formerly this work had been for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) an escape from life.
<p/>Formerly he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had felt that without this work his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) life would be too gloomy.
<p/>Now these pursuits were necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that life might not be too uniformly bright.
<p/>Taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) manuscript, reading through what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had written, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) found with pleasure that the work was worth his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) working at.
<p/>Many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) old ideas seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) superfluous and extreme, but many blanks became distinct to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) reviewed the whole thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) memory.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was writing now a new chapter on the causes of the present disastrous condition of agriculture in Russia.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) maintained that the poverty of Russia arises not merely from the anomalous distribution of landed property and misdirected reforms, but that what had contributed of late years to this result was the civilization from without abnormally grafted upon Russia, especially facilities of communication, as railways, leading to centralization in towns, the development of luxury, and the consequent development of manufactures, credit and its accompaniment of speculation--all to the detriment of agriculture.
<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that in a normal development of wealth in a state all these phenomena would arise only when a considerable amount of labor had been put into agriculture, when it had come under regular, or at least definite, conditions; that the wealth of a country ought to increase proportionally, and especially in such a way that other sources of wealth should not outstrip agriculture; that in harmony with a certain stage of agriculture there should be means of communication corresponding to it, and that in our unsettled condition of the land, railways, called into being by political and not by economic needs, were premature, and instead of promoting agriculture, as was expected of them, they were competing with agriculture and promoting the development of manufactures and credit, and so arresting its progress; and that just as the one-sided and premature development of one organ in an animal would hinder its general development, so in the general development of wealth in Russia, credit, facilities of communication, manufacturing activity, indubitably necessary in Europe, where they had arisen in their proper time, had with us only done harm, by throwing into the background the chief question calling for settlement--the question of the organization of agriculture.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) was writing his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) ideas she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) was thinking how unnaturally cordial her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) husband had been to young Prince Tcharsky, who had, with great want of tact, flirted with her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) the day before they left Moscow.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)'s jealous,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)'s jealous of me!
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) knew that I think no more of them than of Piotr the cook,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) thought, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) head and red neck with a feeling of possession strange to herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Though it's a pity to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) work -LRB-but he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) has plenty of time!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they draw away all the sap and give a false appearance of prosperity,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) muttered, stopping to write, and, feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) and smiling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) looked round.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) queried, smiling, and getting up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How happy we are alone together!--I am, that is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) said, going up to her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) with a radiant smile of happiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; tell me, what was it?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I, of all people, have such happiness!

 (<font color='red'><b>culprits</b></font>)</div><p/>Work did not progress further, and they darted apart from one another like culprits when Kouzma came in to announce that tea was ready.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Left alone, after putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) manuscripts together in the new portfolio bought by her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands at the new washstand with the elegant fittings, that had all made their appearance with her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>).
<p/>Levin smiled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own thoughts, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head disapprovingly at those thoughts; a feeling akin to remorse fretted him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>There was something shameful, effeminate, Capuan, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) called it to himself, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) present mode of life.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not right to go on like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought.

<p/>On the land I scarcely walk or drive about at all to look after things.
<p/>Either I am loath to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>), or I see she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>)'s dull alone.
<p/>And I used to think that, before marriage, life was nothing much, somehow didn't count, but that after marriage, life began in earnest.

<p/>No, this won't do; I must begin.
<p/>Of course, it's not her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) fault.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>)'s not to blame in any way.
<p/>I ought myself to be firmer, to maintain my masculine independence of action; or else I shall get into such ways, and she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>)'ll get used to them too....  Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>)'s not to blame,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) told himself.
<p/>But it is hard for anyone who is dissatisfied not to blame someone else, and especially the person nearest of all to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), for the ground of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dissatisfaction.
<p/>And it vaguely came into Levin's mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) herself was not to blame -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) could not be to blame for anything-RRB-, but what was to blame was her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) education, too superficial and frivolous.
<p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``That fool Tcharsky: she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) wanted, I know, to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), but didn't know how to.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, apart from her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) interest in the house -LRB-that she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) has-RRB-, apart from dress and broderie anglaise , she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) has no serious interests.
<p/>No interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) work, in the estate, in the peasants, nor in music, though she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>)'s rather good at it, nor in reading.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) does nothing, and is perfectly satisfied.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart, censured this, and did not as yet understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) was preparing for that period of activity which was to come for her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) would at once be the wife of her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) husband and mistress of the house, and would bear, and nurse, and bring up children.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knew not that she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) was instinctively aware of this, and preparing herself for this time of terrible toil, did not reproach herself for the moments of carelessness and happiness in her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) love that she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) enjoyed now while gaily building her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) nest for the future.
<p/>Chapter 16   When Levin went upstairs, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife was sitting near the new silver samovar behind the new tea service, and, having settled old Agafea Mihalovna at a little table with a full cup of tea, was reading a letter from Dolly, with whom they were in continual and frequent correspondence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, your good lady's settled me here, told me to sit a bit with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Agafea Mihalovna</b></font>)</div>said Agafea Mihalovna, smiling affectionately at Kitty.
<p/>In these words of Agafea Mihalovna, Levin read the final act of the drama which had been enacted of late between her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) and Kitty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw that, in spite of Agafea Mihalovna's feelings being hurt by a new mistress taking the reins of government out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hands, Kitty had yet conquered her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) love her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, I opened your letter too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, handing him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) an illiterate letter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's from that woman, I think, your brother's...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not read it through.
<p/>This is from my people and from Dolly.
<p/>Fancy!
<p/>Dolly took Tanya and Grisha to a children's ball at the Sarmatskys': Tanya was a French marquise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>But Levin did not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>).
<p/>Flushing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took the letter from Marya Nikolaevna, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's former mistress, and began to read it.
<p/>This was the second letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had received from Marya Nikolaevna.
<p/>In the first letter, Marya Nikolaevna wrote that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) away for no fault of hers, and, with touching simplicity, added that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) was in want again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) asked for nothing, and wished for nothing, but was only tormented by the thought that Nikolay Dmitrievitch would come to grief without her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>), owing to the weak state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) health, and begged his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother to look after him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) wrote quite differently.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) had found Nikolay Dmitrievitch, had again made it up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in Moscow, and had moved with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to a provincial town, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had received a post in the government service.
<p/>But that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had quarreled with the head official, and was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) way back to Moscow, only he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been taken so ill on the road that it was doubtful if he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would ever leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bed again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) wrote.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's always of you he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) has talked, and, besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) has no more money left.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Read this; Dolly writes about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>Kitty was beginning, with a smile; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) stopped suddenly, noticing the changed expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband's face.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) writes to me that Nikolay, my brother, is at death's door.

 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty's face changed at once.
<p/>Thoughts of Tanya as a marquise, of Dolly, all had vanished.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When are you going?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kitty!
<p/>What are you thinking of?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) said reproachfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>offended that he (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) should seem to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) suggestion unwillingly and with vexation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't I go?
<p/>I shan't be in your way.
<p/>I...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm going because my brother is dying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?
<p/>For the same reason as you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, at a moment of such gravity for me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) only thinks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) being dull by herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>thought Levin.
<p/>And this lack of candor in a matter of such gravity infuriated him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's out of the question,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said sternly.
<p/>Agafea Mihalovna, seeing that it was coming to a quarrel, gently put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) cup and withdrew.
<p/>Kitty did not even notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>The tone in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband had said the last words wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), especially because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) evidently did not believe what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you, that if you go, I shall come with you; I shall certainly come,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said hastily and wrathfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why out of the question?
<p/>Why do you say it's out of the question?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it'll be going God knows where, by all sorts of roads and to all sorts of hotels.
<p/>You would be a hindrance to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, trying to be cool.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all.
<p/>I don't want anything.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, you always ascribe base, vile motives to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said with tears of wounded pride and fury.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No; this is awful!
<p/>To be such a slave!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Levin, getting up, and unable to restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) anger any longer.
<p/>But at the same second he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was beating himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why did you marry?
<p/>You could have been free.
<p/>Why did you, if you regret it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, getting up and running away into the drawing room.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was sobbing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began to speak, trying to find words not to dissuade but simply to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not heed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and would not agree to anything.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bent down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand, which resisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hair, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand again--still she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was silent.
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands and said <div class="bookquote">``Kitty!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) suddenly recovered herself, and began to cry, and they were reconciled.
<p/>It was decided that they should go together the next day.
<p/>Levin told his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wanted to go simply in order to be of use, agreed that Marya Nikolaevna's being with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother did not make her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) going improper, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) set off at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart dissatisfied both with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) and with himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was dissatisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) for being unable to make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) mind to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) go when it was necessary -LRB-and how strange it was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), so lately hardly daring to believe in such happiness as that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) could love him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)--now was unhappy because she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) too much!
<p/>-RRB-, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was dissatisfied with himself for not showing more strength of will.
<p/>Even greater was the feeling of disagreement at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) not needing to consider the woman who was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought with horror of all the contingencies they might meet with.
<p/>The mere idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) Kitty, being in the same room with a common wench, set him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shuddering with horror and loathing.
<p/>Chapter 17   The hotel of the provincial town where Nikolay Levin was lying ill was one of those provincial hotels which are constructed on the newest model of modern improvements, with the best intentions of cleanliness, comfort, and even elegance, but owing to the public that patronizes them, are with astounding rapidity transformed into filthy taverns with a pretension of modern improvement that only makes them worse than the old-fashioned, honestly filthy hotels.
<p/>This hotel had already reached that stage, and the soldier in a filthy uniform smoking in the entry, supposed to stand for a hall-porter, and the cast-iron, slippery, dark, and disagreeable staircase, and the free and easy waiter in a filthy frock coat, and the common dining room with a dusty bouquet of wax flowers adorning the table, and filth, dust, and disorder everywhere, and at the same time the sort of modern up-to-date self-complacent railway uneasiness of this hotel, aroused a most painful feeling in Levin after their fresh young life, especially because the impression of falsity made by the hotel was so out of keeping with what awaited them.
<p/>As is invariably the case, after they had been asked at what price they wanted rooms, it appeared that there was not one decent room for them; one decent room had been taken by the inspector of railroads, another by a lawyer from Moscow, a third by Princess Astafieva from the country.
<p/>There remained only one filthy room, next to which they promised that another should be empty by the evening.
<p/>Feeling angry with his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) wife because what he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had expected had come to pass, which was that at the moment of arrival, when his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) heart throbbed with emotion and anxiety to know how his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) brother was getting on, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) should have to be seeing after her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), instead of rushing straight to his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) brother, Levin conducted her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to the room assigned them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go, do go!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with timid and guilty eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went out of the door without a word, and at once stumbled over Marya Nikolaevna, who had heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arrival and had not dared to go in to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) was just the same as when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) in Moscow; the same woolen gown, and bare arms and neck, and the same good-naturedly stupid, pockmarked face, only a little plumper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how is he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)?
<p/>how is he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very bad.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) can't get up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) has kept expecting you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).... Are you...with your wife?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin did not for the first moment understand what it was confused her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) immediately enlightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go away.
<p/>I'll go down to the kitchen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brought out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nikolay Dmitrievitch will be delighted.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard about it, and knows your lady, and remembers her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) abroad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin realized that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) meant his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife, and did not know what answer to make.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along, come along to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/>But as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) moved, the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) room opened and Kitty peeped out.
<p/>Levin crimsoned both from shame and anger with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife, who had put herself and him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in such a difficult position; but Marya Nikolaevna crimsoned still more.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) positively shrank together and flushed to the point of tears, and clutching the ends of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) apron in both hands, twisted them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) red fingers without knowing what to say and what to do.
<p/>For the first instant Levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the eyes with which Kitty looked at this awful woman, so incomprehensible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>); but it lasted only a single instant.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!
<p/>how is he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband and then to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But one can't go on talking in the passage like this!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin said, looking angrily at a gentleman who walked jauntily at that instant across the corridor, as though about his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) affairs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, turning to Marya Nikolaevna, who had recovered herself, but noticing her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband's face of dismay, <div class="bookquote">``or go on; go, and then come for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, and went back into the room.
<p/>Levin went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not in the least expected what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw and felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had expected to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in the same state of self-deception which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had heard was so frequent with the consumptive, and which had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) so much during his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's visit in the autumn.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had expected to find the physical signs of the approach of death more marked--greater weakness, greater emaciation, but still almost the same condition of things.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had expected himself to feel the same distress at the loss of the brother he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) loved and the same horror in face of death as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had felt then, only in a greater degree.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had prepared himself for this; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) found something utterly different.
<p/>In a little dirty room with the painted panels of its walls filthy with spittle, and conversation audible through the thin partition from the next room, in a stifling atmosphere saturated with impurities, on a bedstead moved away from the wall, there lay covered with a quilt, a body.
<p/>One arm of this body was above the quilt, and the wrist, huge as a rake-handle, was attached, inconceivably it seemed, to the thin, long bone of the arm smooth from the beginning to the middle.
<p/>The head lay sideways on the pillow.
<p/>Levin could see the scanty locks wet with sweat on the temples and tense, transparent-looking forehead.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It cannot be that that fearful body was my brother Nikolay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Levin.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went closer, saw the face, and doubt became impossible.
<p/>In spite of the terrible change in the face, Levin had only to glance at those eager eyes raised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) approach, only to catch the faint movement of the mouth under the sticky mustache, to realize the terrible truth that this death-like body was his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) living brother.
<p/>The glittering eyes looked sternly and reproachfully at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drew near.
<p/>And immediately this glance established a living relationship between living men.
<p/>Levin immediately felt the reproach in the eyes fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and felt remorse at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own happiness.
<p/>When Konstantin took him (<font color='blue'><b>Konstantin</b></font>) by the hand, Nikolay smiled.
<p/>The smile was faint, scarcely perceptible, and in spite of the smile the stern expression of the eyes was unchanged.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not expect to find me like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) articulated with effort.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes...no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, hesitating over his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How was it you didn't let me know before, that is, at the time of my wedding?
<p/>I made inquiries in all directions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to talk so as not to be silent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not know what to say, especially as his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother made no reply, and simply stared without dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes, and evidently penetrated to the inner meaning of each word.
<p/>Levin told his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife had come with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Nikolay expressed pleasure, but said he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) was afraid of frightening her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) condition.
<p/>A silence followed.
<p/>Suddenly Nikolay stirred, and began to say something.
<p/>Levin expected something of peculiar gravity and importance from the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face, but Nikolay began speaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) health.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) found fault with the doctor, regretting he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) had not a celebrated Moscow doctor.
<p/>Levin saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) still hoped.
<p/>Seizing the first moment of silence, Levin got up, anxious to escape, if only for an instant, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) agonizing emotion, and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would go and fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, and I'll tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to tidy up here.
<p/>It's dirty and stinking here, I expect.
<p/>Marya!
<p/>clear up the room,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the sick man said with effort.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, and when you've cleared up, go away yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, looking inquiringly at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother.
<p/>Levin made no answer.
<p/>Going out into the corridor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stopped short.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife, but now, taking stock of the emotion he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was feeling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would try on the contrary to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) not to go in to the sick man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) suffer as I am suffering?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty asked with a frightened face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's awful, it's awful!
<p/>What did you come for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin.
<p/>Kitty was silent for a few seconds, looking timidly and ruefully at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) went up and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) by the elbow with both hands.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kostya!
<p/>take me to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>); it will be easier for us to bear it together.
<p/>You only take me, take me to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>), please, and go away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must understand that for me to see you, and not to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>), is far more painful.
<p/>There I might be a help to you and to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>).
<p/>Please, let me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) besought her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband, as though the happiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) life depended on it.
<p/>Levin was obliged to agree, and regaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) composure, and completely forgetting about Marya Nikolaevna by now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went again in to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother with Kitty.
<p/>Stepping lightly, and continually glancing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband, showing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a valorous and sympathetic face, Kitty went into the sick-room, and, turning without haste, noiselessly closed the door.
<p/>With inaudible steps she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) went quickly to the sick man's bedside, and going up so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) immediately clasped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) fresh young hand the skeleton of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) huge hand, pressed it, and began speaking with that soft eagerness, sympathetic and not jarring, which is peculiar to women.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have met, though we were not acquainted, at Soden,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You never thought I was to be your sister?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not have recognized me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Soden</b></font>) said, with a radiant smile at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) entrance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I should.
<p/>What a good thing you let us know!
<p/>Not a day has passed that Kostya has not mentioned you, and been anxious.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>But the sick man's interest did not last long.
<p/>Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had finished speaking, there had come back into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face the stern, reproachful expression of the dying man's envy of the living.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you are not quite comfortable here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, turning away from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fixed stare, and looking about the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must ask about another room,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``so that we might be nearer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 18   Levin could not look calmly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not himself be natural and calm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) presence.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went in to the sick man, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) attention were unconsciously dimmed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not see and did not distinguish the details of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's position.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) smelt the awful odor, saw the dirt, disorder, and miserable condition, and heard the groans, and felt that nothing could be done to help.
<p/>It never entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head to analyze the details of the sick man's situation, to consider how that body was lying under the quilt, how those emaciated legs and thighs and spine were lying huddled up, and whether they could not be made more comfortable, whether anything could not be done to make things, if not better, at least less bad.
<p/>It made his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) blood run cold when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began to think of all these details.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was absolutely convinced that nothing could be done to prolong his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's life or to relieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) suffering.
<p/>But a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) regarding all aid as out of the question was felt by the sick man, and exasperated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>And this made it still more painful for Levin.
<p/>To be in the sick-room was agony to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), not to be there still worse.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was continually, on various pretexts, going out of the room, and coming in again, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was unable to remain alone.
<p/>But Kitty thought, and felt, and acted quite differently.
<p/>On seeing the sick man, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) pitied him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>And pity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) womanly heart did not arouse at all that feeling of horror and loathing that it aroused in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband, but a desire to act, to find out all the details of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) state, and to remedy them.
<p/>And since she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had not the slightest doubt that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) duty to help him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had no doubt either that it was possible, and immediately set to work.
<p/>The very details, the mere thought of which reduced her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband to terror, immediately engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) attention.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sent for the doctor, sent to the chemist's, set the maid who had come with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) and Marya Nikolaevna to sweep and dust and scrub; she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) herself washed up something, washed out something else, laid something under the quilt.
<p/>Something was by her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) directions brought into the sick-room, something else was carried out.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) herself went several times to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) room, regardless of the men she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) met in the corridor, got out and brought in sheets, pillow cases, towels, and shirts.
<p/>The waiter, who was busy with a party of engineers dining in the dining hall, came several times with an irate countenance in answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) summons, and could not avoid carrying out her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) orders, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) gave them with such gracious insistence that there was no evading her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>).
<p/>Levin did not approve of all this; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not believe it would be of any good to the patient.
<p/>Above all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) feared the patient would be angry at it.
<p/>But the sick man, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed and was indifferent about it, was not angry, but only abashed, and on the whole as it were interested in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) was doing with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Coming back from the doctor to whom Kitty had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), Levin, on opening the door, came upon the sick man at the instant when, by Kitty's directions, they were changing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) linen.
<p/>The long white ridge of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spine, with the huge, prominent shoulder blades and jutting ribs and vertebrae, was bare, and Marya Nikolaevna and the waiter were struggling with the sleeve of the night shirt, and could not get the long, limp arm into it.
<p/>Kitty, hurriedly closing the door after Levin, was not looking that way; but the sick man groaned, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) moved rapidly towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Make haste,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't you come,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the sick man angrily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll do it my myself...''   (<font color='red'><b>Marya Nikolaevna/Marya</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marya Nikolaevna/Marya</b></font>)</div><p/>queried Marya Nikolaevna.
<p/>But Kitty heard and saw he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was ashamed and uncomfortable at being naked before her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not looking, I'm not looking!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, putting the arm in.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marya Nikolaevna, you come this side, you do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) added.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please go for me, there's a little bottle in my small bag,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) said, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``you know, in the side pocket; bring it, please, and meanwhile they'll finish clearing up here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>Returning with the bottle, Levin found the sick man settled comfortably and everything about him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) completely changed.
<p/>The heavy smell was replaced by the smell of aromatic vinegar, which Kitty with pouting lips and puffed-out, rosy cheeks was squirting through a little pipe.
<p/>There was no dust visible anywhere, a rug was laid by the bedside.
<p/>On the table stood medicine bottles and decanters tidily arranged, and the linen needed was folded up there, and Kitty's  broderie anglaise .
<p/>On the other table by the patient's bed there were candles and drink and powders.
<p/>The sick man himself, washed and combed, lay in clean sheets on high raised pillows, in a clean night-shirt with a white collar about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) astoundingly thin neck, and with a new expression of hope looked fixedly at Kitty.
<p/>The doctor brought by Levin, and found by him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) at the club, was not the one who had been attending Nikolay Levin, as the patient was dissatisfied with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>The new doctor took up a stethoscope and sounded the patient, shook his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) head, prescribed medicine, and with extreme minuteness explained first how to take the medicine and then what diet was to be kept to.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) advised eggs, raw or hardly cooked, and seltzer water, with warm milk at a certain temperature.
<p/>When the doctor had gone away the sick man said something to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother, of which Levin could distinguish only the last words: <div class="bookquote">``Your Katya.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>By the expression with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>), Levin saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was praising her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) called indeed to Katya, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm much better already,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, with you I should have got well long ago.
<p/>How nice it is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) hand and drew it towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lips, but as though afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) would dislike it he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind, let it go, and only stroked it.
<p/>Kitty took his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand in both hers and pressed it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now turn me over on the left side and go to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/>No one could make out what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said but Kitty; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) alone understood.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) understood because she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was all the while mentally keeping watch on what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) needed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the other side,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) always sleeps on that side.
<p/>Turn him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) over, it's so disagreeable calling the servants.
<p/>I'm not strong enough.
<p/>Can you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said to Marya Nikolaevna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marya Nikolaevna/Marya</b></font>)</div>answered Marya Nikolaevna.
<p/>Terrible as it was to Levin to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arms round that terrible body, to take hold of that under the quilt, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) preferred to know nothing, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife's influence he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) resolute face that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew so well, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arms into the bed took hold of the body, but in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own strength he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was struck by the strange heaviness of those powerless limbs.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was turning him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) over, conscious of the huge emaciated arm about his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) neck, Kitty swiftly and noiselessly turned the pillow, beat it up and settled in it the sick man's head, smoothing back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair, which was sticking again to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moist brow.
<p/>The sick man kept his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother's hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own.
<p/>Levin felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) meant to do something with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand and was pulling it somewhere.
<p/>Levin yielded with a sinking heart: yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drew it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mouth and kissed it.
<p/>Levin, shaking with sobs and unable to articulate a word, went out of the room.
<p/>Chapter 19   <div class="bookquote">``Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>So Levin thought about his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that evening.
<p/>Levin thought of the text, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) considered himself <div class="bookquote">``wise and prudent.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not so consider himself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not help knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had more intellect than his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife and Agafea Mihalovna, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not help knowing that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought of death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought with all the force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) intellect.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew too that the brains of many great men, whose thoughts he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had read, had brooded over death and yet knew not a hundredth part of what his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife and Agafea Mihalovna knew about it.
<p/>Different as those two women were, Agafea Mihalovna and Katya, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother Nikolay had called her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>), and as Levin particularly liked to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) now, they were quite alike in this.
<p/>Both knew, without a shade of doubt, what sort of thing life was and what was death, and though neither of them could have answered, and would even not have understood the questions that presented themselves to Levin, both had no doubt of the significance of this event, and were precisely alike in their way of looking at it, which they shared with millions of people.
<p/>The proof that they knew for a certainty the nature of death lay in the fact that they knew without a second of hesitation how to deal with the dying, and were not frightened of them.
<p/>Levin and other men like him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), though they could have said a great deal about death, obviously did not know this since they were afraid of death, and were absolutely at a loss what to do when people were dying.
<p/>If Levin had been alone now with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother Nikolay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would have looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with terror, and with still greater terror waited, and would not have known what else to do.
<p/>More than that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not know what to say, how to look, how to move.
<p/>To talk of outside things seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shocking, impossible, to talk of death and depressing subjects--also impossible.
<p/>To be silent, also impossible.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) will think I am studying him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), I am afraid; if I don't look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'ll think I'm thinking of other things.
<p/>If I walk on tiptoe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) will be vexed; to tread firmly, I'm ashamed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty evidently did not think of herself, and had no time to think about herself: she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was thinking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knew something, and all went well.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) about herself even and about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wedding, and smiled and sympathized with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and petted him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and talked of cases of recovery and all went well; so then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) must know.
<p/>The proof that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) behavior and Agafea Mihalovna's was not instinctive, animal, irrational, was that apart from the physical treatment, the relief of suffering, both Agafea Mihalovna and Kitty required for the dying man something else more important than the physical treatment, and something which had nothing in common with physical conditions.
<p/>Agafea Mihalovna, speaking of the man just dead, had said: <div class="bookquote">``Well, thank God, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) took the sacrament and received absolution; God grant each one of us such a death.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Katya in just the same way, besides all her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) care about linen, bedsores, drink, found time the very first day to persuade the sick man of the necessity of taking the sacrament and receiving absolution.
<p/>On getting back from the sick-room to their own two rooms for the night, Levin sat with hanging head not knowing what to do.
<p/>Not to speak of supper, of preparing for bed, of considering what they were going to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not even talk to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was ashamed to.
<p/>Kitty, on the contrary, was more active than usual.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was even livelier than usual.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) ordered supper to be brought, herself unpacked their things, and herself helped to make the beds, and did not even forget to sprinkle them with Persian powder.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) showed that alertness, that swiftness of reflection comes out in men before a battle, in conflict, in the dangerous and decisive moments of life--those moments when a man shows once and for all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) value, and that all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) past has not been wasted but has been a preparation for these moments.
<p/>Everything went rapidly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hands, and before it was twelve o'clock all their things were arranged cleanly and tidily in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) rooms, in such a way that the hotel rooms seemed like home: the beds were made, brushes, combs, looking-glasses were put out, table napkins were spread.
<p/>Levin felt that it was unpardonable to eat, to sleep, to talk even now, and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that every movement he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) made was unseemly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) arranged the brushes, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did it all so that there was nothing shocking in it.
<p/>They could neither of them eat, however, and for a long while they could not sleep, and did not even go to bed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad I persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to receive extreme unction tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) dressing jacket before her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) folding looking glass, combing her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) soft, fragrant hair with a fine comb.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never seen it, but I know, mamma has told me, there are prayers said for recovery.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I asked the doctor; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) couldn't live more than three days.
<p/>But can they be sure?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything is possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) added with that peculiar, rather sly expression that was always in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) spoke of religion.
<p/>Since their conversation about religion when they were engaged neither of them had ever started a discussion of the subject, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) performed all the ceremonies of going to church, saying her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) prayers, and so on, always with the unvarying conviction that this ought to be so.
<p/>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) assertion to the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was firmly persuaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was as much a Christian as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and indeed a far better one; and all that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said about it was simply one of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) absurd masculine freaks, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would say about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)  broderie anglaise  that good people patch holes, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) cut them on purpose, and so on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you see this woman, Marya Nikolaevna, did not know how to manage all this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would have been miserable for you to be alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) said, and lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) hands which hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) cheeks flushing with pleasure, twisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) coil of hair on the nape of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) neck and pinned it there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,  might have been ,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said mournfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s just one of those people of whom they say they're not for this world.''

<p/>Chapter 20   The next day the sick man received the sacrament and extreme unction.
<p/>During the ceremony Nikolay Levin prayed fervently.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) great eyes, fastened on the holy image that was set out on a card table covered with a colored napkin, expressed such passionate prayer and hope that it was awful to Levin to see it.
<p/>Levin knew that this passionate prayer and hope would only make him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) feel more bitterly parting from the life he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) so loved.
<p/>Levin knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother and the workings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) intellect: he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) unbelief came not from life being easier for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) without faith, but had grown up because step by step the contemporary scientific interpretation of natural phenomena crushed out the possibility of faith; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) present return was not a legitimate one, brought about by way of the same working of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) intellect, but simply a temporary, interested return to faith in a desperate hope of recovery.
<p/>Levin knew too that Kitty had strengthened his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hope by accounts of the marvelous recoveries she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had heard of.
<p/>Levin knew all this; and it was agonizingly painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to behold the supplicating, hopeful eyes and the emaciated wrist, lifted with difficulty, making the sign of the cross on the tense brow, and the prominent shoulders and hollow, gasping chest, which one could not feel consistent with the life the sick man was praying for.
<p/>During the sacrament Levin did what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), an unbeliever, had done a thousand times.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, addressing God, <div class="bookquote">``If Thou dost exist, make this man to recover''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>-LRB-of course this same thing has been repeated many times-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``and Thou wilt save him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div><p/>After extreme unction the sick man became suddenly much better.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not cough once in the course of an hour, smiled, kissed Kitty's hand, thanking her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) with tears, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was comfortable, free from pain, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt strong and had an appetite.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even raised himself when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soup was brought, and asked for a cutlet as well.
<p/>Hopelessly ill as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, obvious as it was at the first glance that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not recover, Levin and Kitty were for that hour both in the same state of excitement, happy, though fearful of being mistaken.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) better?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's wonderful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing wonderful in it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyway, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s better,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they said in a whisper, smiling to one another.
<p/>This self-deception was not of long duration.
<p/>The sick man fell into a quiet sleep, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was waked up half an hour later by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cough.
<p/>And all at once every hope vanished in those about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and in himself.
<p/>The reality of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suffering crushed all hopes in Levin and Kitty and in the sick man himself, leaving no doubt, no memory even of past hopes.
<p/>Without referring to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had believed in half an hour before, as though ashamed even to recall it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) asked for iodine to inhale in a bottle covered with perforated paper.
<p/>Levin gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) the bottle, and the same look of passionate hope with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had taken the sacrament was now fastened on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, demanding from him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) the confirmation of the doctor's words that inhaling iodine worked wonders.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Katya not here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gasped, looking round while Levin reluctantly assented to the doctor's words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; so I can say it....
<p/>It was for her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) sake I went through that farce.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>)'s so sweet; but you and I can't deceive ourselves.
<p/>This is what I believe in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, and, squeezing the bottle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bony hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began breathing over it.
<p/>At eight o'clock in the evening Levin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife were drinking tea in their room when Marya Nikolaevna ran in to them breathlessly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) was pale, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) lips were quivering.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) is dying!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) whispered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid will die this minute.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Both of them ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was sitting raised up with one elbow on the bed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) long back bent, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head hanging low.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you feel?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin asked in a whisper, after a silence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel I'm setting off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Nikolay said with difficulty, but with extreme distinctness, screwing the words out of himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) did not raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) head, but simply turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) eyes upwards, without their reaching his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) brother's face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Katya, go away!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) added.
<p/>Levin jumped up, and with a peremptory whisper made her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) go out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm setting off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you think so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, so as to say something.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I'm setting off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) repeated, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had a liking for the phrase.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the end.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marya Nikolaevna/Marya</b></font>)</div><p/>Marya Nikolaevna went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better lie down; you'd be easier,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall lie down soon enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pronounced slowly, <div class="bookquote">``when I'm dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said sarcastically, wrathfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can lay me down if you like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) back, sat down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and gazed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) breath.
<p/>The dying man lay with closed eyes, but the muscles twitched from time to time on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) forehead, as with one thinking deeply and intensely.
<p/>Levin involuntarily thought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) of what it was that was happening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) now, but in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mental efforts to go along with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw by the expression of that calm, stern face that for the dying man all was growing clearer and clearer that was still as dark as ever for Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the dying man articulated slowly at intervals.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a little.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was silent.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pronounced all at once reassuringly, as though all were solved for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Lord!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) murmured, and sighed deeply.
<p/>Marya Nikolaevna felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) feet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're getting cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) whispered.
<p/>For a long while, a very long while it seemed to Levin, the sick man lay motionless.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was still alive, and from time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sighed.
<p/>Levin by now was exhausted from mental strain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that, with no mental effort, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) understand what it was that was  right .
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not even think of the problem of death itself, but with no will of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own thoughts kept coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to do next; closing the dead man's eyes, dressing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), ordering the coffin.
<p/>And, strange to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt utterly cold, and was not conscious of sorrow nor of loss, less still of pity for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had any feeling for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother at that moment, it was envy for the knowledge the dying man had now that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not have.
<p/>A long time more he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so, continually expecting the end.
<p/>But the end did not come.
<p/>The door opened and Kitty appeared.
<p/>Levin got up to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>But at the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was getting up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) caught the sound of the dying man stirring.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't go away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Nikolay and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Levin gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and angrily waved to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife to go away.
<p/>With the dying man's hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sat for half an hour, an hour, another hour.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not think of death at all now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wondered what Kitty was doing; who lived in the next room; whether the doctor lived in a house of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) own.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) longed for food and for sleep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cautiously drew away his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hand and felt the feet.
<p/>The feet were cold, but the sick man was still breathing.
<p/>Levin tried again to move away on tiptoe, but the sick man stirred again and said: <div class="bookquote">``Don't go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * * * * *  The dawn came; the sick man's condition was unchanged.
<p/>Levin stealthily withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand, and without looking at the dying man, went off to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own room and went to sleep.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) woke up, instead of news of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother's death which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expected, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) learned that the sick man had returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) earlier condition.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had begun sitting up again, coughing, had begun eating again, talking again, and again had ceased to talk of death, again had begun to express hope of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recovery, and had become more irritable and more gloomy than ever.
<p/>No one, neither his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother nor Kitty, could soothe him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was angry with everyone, and said nasty things to everyone, reproached everyone for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sufferings, and insisted that they should get him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a celebrated doctor from Moscow.
<p/>To all inquiries made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as to how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made the same answer with an expression of vindictive reproachfulness, <div class="bookquote">``I'm suffering horribly, intolerably!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The sick man was suffering more and more, especially from bedsores, which it was impossible now to remedy, and grew more and more angry with everyone about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), blaming them for everything, and especially for not having brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a doctor from Moscow.
<p/>Kitty tried in every possible way to relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), to soothe him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but it was all in vain, and Levin saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) herself was exhausted both physically and morally, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) would not admit it.
<p/>The sense of death, which had been evoked in all by his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) taking leave of life on the night when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had sent for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, was broken up.
<p/>Everyone knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must inevitably die soon, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was half dead already.
<p/>Everyone wished for nothing but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) should die as soon as possible, and everyone, concealing this, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) medicines, tried to find remedies and doctors, and deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and themselves and each other.
<p/>All this was falsehood, disgusting, irreverent deceit.
<p/>And owing to the bent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) character, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) loved the dying man more than anyone else did, Levin was most painfully conscious of this deceit.
<p/>Levin, who had long been possessed by the idea of reconciling his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brothers, at least in face of death, had written to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, Sergey Ivanovitch, and having received an answer from him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) read this letter to the sick man.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch wrote that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) could not come himself, and in touching terms he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) begged his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother's forgiveness.
<p/>The sick man said nothing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you are not angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not the least!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Nikolay answered, vexed at the question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) to send me a doctor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Three more days of agony followed; the sick man was still in the same condition.
<p/>The sense of longing for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death was felt by everyone now at the mere sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), by the waiters and the hotel-keeper and all the people staying in the hotel, and the doctor and Marya Nikolaevna and Levin and Kitty.
<p/>The sick man alone did not express this feeling, but on the contrary was furious at their not getting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doctors, and went on taking medicine and talking of life.
<p/>Only at rare moments, when the opium gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an instant's relief from the never-ceasing pain, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would sometimes, half asleep, utter what was ever more intense in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart than in all the others: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, if it were only the end!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/>or: <div class="bookquote">``When will it be over?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sufferings, steadily growing more intense, did their work and prepared him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for death.
<p/>There was no position in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not in pain, there was not a minute in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was unconscious of it, not a limb, not a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body that did not ache and cause him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) agony.
<p/>Even the memories, the impressions, the thoughts of this body awakened in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now the same aversion as the body itself.
<p/>The sight of other people, their remarks, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own reminiscences, everything was for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a source of agony.
<p/>Those about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt this, and instinctively did not allow themselves to move freely, to talk, to express their wishes before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>All his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life was merged in the one feeling of suffering and desire to be rid of it.
<p/>There was evidently coming over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that revulsion that would make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look upon death as the goal of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desires, as happiness.
<p/>Hitherto each individual desire, aroused by suffering or privation, such as hunger, fatigue, thirst, had been satisfied by some bodily function giving pleasure.
<p/>But now no physical craving or suffering received relief, and the effort to relieve them only caused fresh suffering.
<p/>And so all desires were merged in one--the desire to be rid of all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sufferings and their source, the body.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no words to express this desire of deliverance, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not speak of it, and from habit asked for the satisfaction of desires which could not now be satisfied.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Turn me over on the other side,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would say, and immediately after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would ask to be turned back again as before.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me some broth.
<p/>Take away the broth.
<p/>Talk of something: why are you silent?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And directly they began to talk he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would close his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, and would show weariness, indifference, and loathing.
<p/>On the tenth day from their arrival at the town, Kitty was unwell.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) suffered from headache and sickness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not get up all the morning.
<p/>The doctor opined that the indisposition arose from fatigue and excitement, and prescribed rest.
<p/>After dinner, however, Kitty got up and went as usual with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) work to the sick man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sternly when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) came in, and smiled contemptuously when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had been unwell.
<p/>That day he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was continually blowing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose, and groaning piteously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you feel?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) articulated with difficulty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In pain!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In pain, where?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everywhere.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be over today, you will see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marya Nikolaevna/Marya</b></font>)</div>said Marya Nikolaevna.
<p/>Though it was said in a whisper, the sick man, whose hearing Levin had noticed was very keen, must have heard.
<p/>Levin said hush to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>), and looked round at the sick man.
<p/>Nikolay had heard; but these words produced no effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) eyes had still the same intense, reproachful look.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you think so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) into the corridor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) has begun picking at himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marya Nikolaevna/Marya</b></font>)</div>said Marya Nikolaevna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) said, tugging at the folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolaevna</b></font>) woolen skirt.
<p/>Levin noticed, indeed, that all that day the patient pulled at himself, as it were, trying to snatch something away.
<p/>Marya Nikolaevna's prediction came true.
<p/>Towards night the sick man was not able to lift his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, and could only gaze before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the same intensely concentrated expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Even when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother or Kitty bent over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see them, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked just the same.
<p/>Kitty sent for the priest to read the prayer for the dying.
<p/>While the priest was reading it, the dying man did not show any sign of life; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were closed.
<p/>Levin, Kitty, and Marya Nikolaevna stood at the bedside.
<p/>The priest had not quite finished reading the prayer when the dying man stretched, sighed, and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>The priest, on finishing the prayer, put the cross to the cold forehead, then slowly returned it to the stand, and after standing for two minutes more in silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) touched the huge, bloodless hand that was turning cold.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>said the priest, and would have moved away; but suddenly there was a faint stir in the mustaches of the dead man that seemed glued together, and quite distinctly in the hush they heard from the bottom of the chest the sharply defined sounds:  <div class="bookquote">``Not quite...soon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>And a minute later the face brightened, a smile came out under the mustaches, and the women who had gathered round began carefully laying out the corpse.
<p/>The sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother, and the nearness of death, revived in Levin that sense of horror in face of the insoluble enigma, together with the nearness and inevitability of death, that had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that autumn evening when his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>This feeling was now even stronger than before; even less than before did he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) feel capable of apprehending the meaning of death, and its inevitability rose up before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) more terrible than ever.
<p/>But now, thanks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife's presence, that feeling did not reduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to despair.
<p/>In spite of death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt the need of life and love.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that love saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) from despair, and that this love, under the menace of despair, had become still stronger and purer.
<p/>The one mystery of death, still unsolved, had scarcely passed before his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes, when another mystery had arisen, as insoluble, urging him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to love and to life.
<p/>The doctor confirmed his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) suppositions in regard to Kitty.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) indisposition was a symptom that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was with child.
<p/>Chapter 21   From the moment when Alexey Alexandrovitch understood from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) interviews with Betsy and with Stepan Arkadyevitch that all that was expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife in peace, without burdening her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) presence, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife herself desired this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt so distraught that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could come to no decision of himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not know himself what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wanted now, and putting himself in the hands of those who were so pleased to interest themselves in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) affairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) met everything with unqualified assent.
<p/>It was only when Anna had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) house, and the English governess sent to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) should dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) or separately, that for the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) clearly comprehended his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) position, and was appalled by it.
<p/>Most difficult of all in this position was the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not in any way connect and reconcile his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) past with what was now.
<p/>It was not the past when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had lived happily with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife that troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>The transition from that past to a knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife's unfaithfulness he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had lived through miserably already; that state was painful, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could understand it.
<p/>If his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife had then, on declaring to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) unfaithfulness, left him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would have been wounded, unhappy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would not have been in the hopeless position--incomprehensible to himself--in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt himself now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not now reconcile his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) immediate past, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) tenderness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) love for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sick wife, and for the other man's child with what was now the case, that is with the fact that, as it were, in return for all this he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) now found himself alone, put to shame, a laughing-stock, needed by no one, and despised by everyone.
<p/>For the first two days after his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife's departure Alexey Alexandrovitch received applicants for assistance and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) chief secretary, drove to the committee, and went down to dinner in the dining room as usual.
<p/>Without giving himself a reason for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was doing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) strained every nerve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) being for those two days, simply to preserve an appearance of composure, and even of indifference.
<p/>Answering inquiries about the disposition of Anna Arkadyevna's rooms and belongings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had exercised immense self-control to appear like a man in whose eyes what had occurred was not unforeseen nor out of the ordinary course of events, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) attained his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) aim: no one could have detected in him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) signs of despair.
<p/>But on the second day after her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) departure, when Korney gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) a bill from a fashionable draper's shop, which Anna had forgotten to pay, and announced that the clerk from the shop was waiting, Alexey Alexandrovitch told him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to show the clerk up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, your excellency, for venturing to trouble you.
<p/>But if you direct us to apply to her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) excellency, would you graciously oblige us with her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) address?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered, as it seemed to the clerk, and all at once, turning round, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sat down at the table.
<p/>Letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head sink into his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sat for a long while in that position, several times attempted to speak and stopped short.
<p/>Korney, perceiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) master's emotion, asked the clerk to call another time.
<p/>Left alone, Alexey Alexandrovitch recognized that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had not the strength to keep up the line of firmness and composure any longer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) gave orders for the carriage that was awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to be taken back, and for no one to be admitted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not go down to dinner.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not endure the weight of universal contempt and exasperation, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had distinctly seen in the face of the clerk and of Korney, and of everyone, without exception, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had met during those two days.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not turn aside from himself the hatred of men, because that hatred did not come from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) being bad -LRB-in that case he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could have tried to be better-RRB-, but from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) being shamefully and repulsively unhappy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knew that for this, for the very fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) heart was torn with grief, they would be merciless to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt that men would crush him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) as dogs strangle a torn dog yelping with pain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sole means of security against people was to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wounds from them, and instinctively he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) tried to do this for two days, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt incapable of keeping up the unequal struggle.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) despair was even intensified by the consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was utterly alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sorrow.
<p/>In all Petersburg there was not a human being to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could express what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was feeling, who would feel for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), not as a high official, not as a member of society, but simply as a suffering man; indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not such a one in the whole world.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch grew up an orphan.
<p/>There were two brothers.
<p/>They did not remember their father, and their mother died when Alexey Alexandrovitch was ten years old.
<p/>The property was a small one.
<p/>Their uncle, Karenin, a government official of high standing, at one time a favorite of the late Tsar, had brought them up.
<p/>On completing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tsar</b></font>) high school and university courses with medals, Alexey Alexandrovitch had, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) uncle's aid, immediately started in a prominent position in the service, and from that time forward he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had devoted himself exclusively to political ambition.
<p/>In the high school and the university, and afterwards in the service, Alexey Alexandrovitch had never formed a close friendship with anyone.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) brother had been the person nearest to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) heart, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had a post in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and was always abroad, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had died shortly after Alexey Alexandrovitch's marriage.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was governor of a province, Anna's aunt, a wealthy provincial lady, had thrown him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)--middle-aged as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was, though young for a governor--with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) niece, and had succeeded in putting him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) in such a position that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had either to declare himself or to leave the town.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch was not long in hesitation.
<p/>There were at the time as many reasons for the step as against it, and there was no overbalancing consideration to outweigh his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) invariable rule of abstaining when in doubt.
<p/>But Anna's aunt had through a common acquaintance insinuated that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had already compromised the girl, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was in honor bound to make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) an offer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) made the offer, and concentrated on his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) betrothed and his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) wife all the feeling of which he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was capable.
<p/>The attachment he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) felt to Anna precluded in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) heart every need of intimate relations with others.
<p/>And now among all his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) acquaintances he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had not one friend.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had plenty of so-called connections, but no friendships.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch had plenty of people whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could invite to dinner, to whose sympathy he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could appeal in any public affair he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was concerned about, whose interest he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could reckon upon for anyone he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wished to help, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could candidly discuss other people's business and affairs of state.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) relations with these people were confined to one clearly defined channel, and had a certain routine from which it was impossible to depart.
<p/>There was one man, a comrade of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at the university, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made friends later, and with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could have spoken of a personal sorrow; but this friend had a post in the Department of Education in a remote part of Russia.
<p/>Of the people in Petersburg the most intimate and most possible were his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) chief secretary and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) doctor.
<p/>Mihail Vassilievitch Sludin, the chief secretary, was a straightforward, intelligent, good-hearted, and conscientious man, and Alexey Alexandrovitch was aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) personal goodwill.
<p/>But their five years of official work together seemed to have put a barrier between them that cut off warmer relations.
<p/>After signing the papers brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), Alexey Alexandrovitch had sat for a long while in silence, glancing at Mihail Vassilievitch, and several times he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) attempted to speak, but could not.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had already prepared the phrase: <div class="bookquote">``You have heard of my trouble?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) ended by saying, as usual: <div class="bookquote">``So you'll get this ready for me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>and with that dismissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>The other person was the doctor, who had also a kindly feeling for him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>); but there had long existed a taciturn understanding between them that both were weighed down by work, and always in a hurry.
<p/>Of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) women friends, foremost amongst them Countess Lidia Ivanovna, Alexey Alexandrovitch never thought.
<p/>All women, simply as women, were terrible and distasteful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 22   Alexey Alexandrovitch had forgotten the Countess Lidia Ivanovna, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had not forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>At the bitterest moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) lonely despair she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and without waiting to be announced, walked straight into his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) study.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head in both hands.  ''
<p/>J'ai forc√© la consigne ,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said, walking in with rapid steps and breathing hard with excitement and rapid exercise.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard all!
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch!
<p/>Dear friend!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) went on, warmly squeezing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hand in both of hers and gazing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) fine pensive eyes into his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch, frowning, got up, and disengaging his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hand, moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) a chair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you sit down, countess?
<p/>I'm seeing no one because I'm unwell, countess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) lips twitched.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear friend!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div><p/>repeated Countess Lidia Ivanovna, never taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes off his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and suddenly her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyebrows rose at the inner corners, describing a triangle on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) forehead, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) ugly yellow face became still uglier, but Alexey Alexandrovitch felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) and was preparing to cry.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) too was softened; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) snatched her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) plump hand and proceeded to kiss it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear friend!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said in a voice breaking with emotion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought not to give way to grief.
<p/>Your sorrow is a great one, but you ought to find consolation.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am crushed, I am annihilated, I am no longer a man!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Alexey Alexandrovitch, letting go her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hand, but still gazing into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) brimming eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My position is so awful because I can find nowhere, I cannot find within me strength to support me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will find support; seek it--not in me, though I beseech you to believe in my friendship,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said, with a sigh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our support is love, that love that He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) has vouchsafed us.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) burden is light,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said, with the look of ecstasy Alexey Alexandrovitch knew so well.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) will be your support and your succor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Although there was in these words a flavor of that sentimental emotion at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) own lofty feelings, and that new mystical fervor which had lately gained ground in Petersburg, and which seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch disproportionate, still it was pleasant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to hear this now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not grieve for that.

<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) now, and those expressions which had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), if not distasteful, at least exaggerated, now seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) natural and consolatory.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch had disliked this new enthusiastic fervor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was a believer, who was interested in religion primarily in its political aspect, and the new doctrine which ventured upon several new interpretations, just because it paved the way to discussion and analysis, was in principle disagreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had hitherto taken up a cold and even antagonistic attitude to this new doctrine, and with Countess Lidia Ivanovna, who had been carried away by it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had never argued, but by silence had assiduously parried her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) attempts to provoke him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) into argument.
<p/>Now for the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) words with pleasure, and did not inwardly oppose them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very, very grateful to you, both for your deeds and for your words,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had finished praying.
<p/>Countess Lidia Ivanovna once more pressed both her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) friend's hands.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I will enter upon my duties,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said with a smile after a pause, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) wiped away the traces of tears.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to Seryozha.
<p/>Only in the last extremity shall I apply to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) got up and went out.
<p/>Countess Lidia Ivanovna went into Seryozha's part of the house, and dropping tears on the scared child's cheeks, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) father was a saint and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mother was dead.
<p/>Countess Lidia Ivanovna kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) promise.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) did actually take upon herself the care of the organization and management of Alexey Alexandrovitch's household.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had not overstated the case when saying that practical affairs were not her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) strong point.
<p/>All her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) arrangements had to be modified because they could not be carried out, and they were modified by Korney, Alexey Alexandrovitch's valet, who, though no one was aware of the fact, now managed Karenin's household, and quietly and discreetly reported to his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) master while he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) was dressing all it was necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) to know.
<p/>But Lidia Ivanovna's help was none the less real; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) gave Alexey Alexandrovitch moral support in the consciousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) love and respect for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and still more, as it was soothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) to believe, in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) almost turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to Christianity--that is, from an indifferent and apathetic believer she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) into an ardent and steadfast adherent of the new interpretation of Christian doctrine, which had been gaining ground of late in Petersburg.
<p/>It was easy for Alexey Alexandrovitch to believe in this teaching.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch, like Lidia Ivanovna indeed, and others who shared their views, was completely devoid of vividness of imagination, that spiritual faculty in virtue of which the conceptions evoked by the imagination become so vivid that they must needs be in harmony with other conceptions, and with actual fact.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw nothing impossible and inconceivable in the idea that death, though existing for unbelievers, did not exist for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was possessed of the most perfect faith, of the measure of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was himself the judge, therefore there was no sin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) soul, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was experiencing complete salvation here on earth.
<p/>It is true that the erroneousness and shallowness of this conception of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) faith was dimly perceptible to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knew that when, without the slightest idea that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) forgiveness was the action of a higher power, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had surrendered directly to the feeling of forgiveness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had felt more happiness than now when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was thinking every instant that Christ was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) heart, and that in signing official papers he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was doing His (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) will.
<p/>But for Alexey Alexandrovitch it was a necessity to think in that way; it was such a necessity for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) humiliation to have some elevated standpoint, however imaginary, from which, looked down upon by all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could look down on others, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) clung, as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) one salvation, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) delusion of salvation.
<p/>Chapter 23   The Countess Lidia Ivanovna had, as a very young and sentimental girl, been married to a wealthy man of high rank, an extremely good-natured, jovial, and extremely dissipated rake.
<p/>Two months after marriage her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) husband abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) impassioned protestations of affection he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) met with a sarcasm and even hostility that people knowing the count's good heart, and seeing no defects in the sentimental Lidia, were at a loss to explain.
<p/>Though they were divorced and lived apart, yet whenever the husband met the wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) invariably behaved to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with the same malignant irony, the cause of which was incomprehensible.
<p/>Countess Lidia Ivanovna had long given up being in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) husband, but from that time she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had never given up being in love with someone.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was in love with several people at once, both men and women; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had been in love with almost everyone who had been particularly distinguished in any way.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was in love with all the new princes and princesses who married into the imperial family; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had been in love with a high dignitary of the Church, a vicar, and a parish priest; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had been in love with a journalist, three Slavophiles, with Komissarov, with a minister, a doctor, an English missionary and Karenin.
<p/>All these passions constantly waning or growing more ardent, did not prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) from keeping up the most extended and complicated relations with the court and fashionable society.
<p/>But from the time that after Karenin's trouble she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) under her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) special protection, from the time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) set to work in Karenin's household looking after his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) welfare, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) felt that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) other attachments were not the real thing, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was now genuinely in love, and with no one but Karenin.
<p/>The feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) now experienced for him (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) stronger than any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) former feelings.
<p/>Analyzing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) feeling, and comparing it with former passions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) distinctly perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would not have been in love with Komissarov if he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) had not saved the life of the Tsar, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would not have been in love with Ristitch-Kudzhitsky if there had been no Slavonic question, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) loved Karenin for himself, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) lofty, uncomprehended soul, for the sweet--to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)--high notes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) voice, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) drawling intonation, his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) weary eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) character, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) soft white hands with their swollen veins.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was not simply overjoyed at meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sought in his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) face signs of the impression she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was making on him (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) tried to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>), not by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) words only, but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) whole person.
<p/>For his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) sake it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) now lavished more care on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) dress than before.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) caught herself in reveries on what might have been, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had not been married and he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) had been free.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) blushed with emotion when he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) came into the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) could not repress a smile of rapture when he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) said anything amiable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>For several days now Countess Lidia Ivanovna had been in a state of intense excitement.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had learned that Anna and Vronsky were in Petersburg.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch must be saved from seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) must be saved even from the torturing knowledge that that awful woman was in the same town with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) might meet her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) any minute.
<p/>Lidia Ivanovna made inquiries through her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) friends as to what those  infamous people , as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) called Anna and Vronsky, intended doing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) endeavored so to guide every movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) friend during those days that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could not come across them.
<p/>The young adjutant, an acquaintance of Vronsky, through whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) obtained her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) information, and who hoped through Countess Lidia Ivanovna to obtain a concession, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) that they had finished their business and were going away next day.
<p/>Lidia Ivanovna had already begun to calm down, when the next morning a note was brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), the handwriting of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) recognized with horror.
<p/>It was the handwriting of Anna Karenina.
<p/>The envelope was of paper as thick as bark; on the oblong yellow paper there was a huge monogram, and the letter smelt of agreeable scent.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who brought it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A commissionaire from the hotel.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div><p/>It was some time before Countess Lidia Ivanovna could sit down to read the letter.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) excitement brought on an attack of asthma, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was subject.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) composure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) read the following letter in French:  ``Madame la Comtesse,  <div class="bookquote">``The Christian feelings with which your heart is filled give me the, I feel, unpardonable boldness to write to you.
<p/>I am miserable at being separated from my son.
<p/>I entreat permission to see him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) once before my departure.
<p/>Forgive me for recalling myself to your memory.
<p/>I apply to you and not to Alexey Alexandrovitch, simply because I do not wish to cause that generous man to suffer in remembering me.
<p/>Knowing your friendship for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I know you will understand me.
<p/>Could you send Seryozha to me, or should I come to the house at some fixed hour, or will you let me know when and where I could see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away from home?
<p/>I do not anticipate a refusal, knowing the magnanimity of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with whom it rests.
<p/>You cannot conceive the craving I have to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and so cannot conceive the gratitude your help will arouse in me.
<p/>Anna''   (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Everything in this letter exasperated Countess Lidia Ivanovna: its contents and the allusion to magnanimity, and especially its free and easy--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) considered--tone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say that there is no answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div>said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, and immediately opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) blotting-book, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) wrote to Alexey Alexandrovitch that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hoped to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) at one o'clock at the levee.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must talk with you of a grave and painful subject.
<p/>There we will arrange where to meet.
<p/>Best of all at my house, where I will order tea  as you like it .
<p/>Urgent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) lays the cross, but He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) gives the strength to bear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) added, so as to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) some slight preparation.
<p/>Countess Lidia Ivanovna usually wrote some two or three letters a day to Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) enjoyed that form of communication, which gave opportunity for a refinement and air of mystery not afforded by their personal interviews.
<p/>Chapter 24   The levee was drawing to a close.
<p/>People met as they were going away, and gossiped of the latest news, of the newly bestowed honors and the changes in the positions of the higher functionaries.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If only Countess Marya Borissovna were Minister of War, and Princess Vatkovskaya were Commander-in-Chief,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said a gray-headed, little old man in a gold-embroidered uniform, addressing a tall, handsome maid of honor who had questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) about the new appointments.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And me among the adjutants,''  (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div>said the maid of honor, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have an appointment already.
<p/>You're over the ecclesiastical department.
<p/>And your assistant's Karenin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-day, prince!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>said the little old man to a man who came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What were you saying of Karenin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>said the prince.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) and Putyatov have received the Alexander Nevsky.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had it already.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.
<p/>Just look at him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the little old man, pointing with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) embroidered hat to Karenin in a court uniform with the new red ribbon across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders, standing in the doorway of the hall with an influential member of the Imperial Council.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pleased and happy as a brass farthing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, stopping to shake hands with a handsome gentleman of the bedchamber of colossal proportions.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s looking older,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman of the bedchamber.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``From overwork.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s always drawing up projects nowadays.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) won't let a poor devil go nowadays till he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'s explained it all to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) under heads.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Looking older, did you say?
<p/>Il fait des passions .
<p/>I believe Countess Lidia Ivanovna's jealous now of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) wife.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come now, please don't say any harm of Countess Lidia Ivanovna.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, is there any harm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) being in love with Karenin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But is it true Madame Karenina's here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, not here in the palace, but in Petersburg.
<p/>I met her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) yesterday with Alexey Vronsky,  bras dessous, bras dessous , in the Morsky.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``C'est un homme qui n'a pas...''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>the gentleman of the bedchamber was beginning, but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stopped to make room, bowing, for a member of the Imperial family to pass.
<p/>Thus people talked incessantly of Alexey Alexandrovitch, finding fault with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) and laughing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), blocking up the way of the member of the Imperial Council he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had captured, was explaining to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) point by point his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) new financial project, never interrupting his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) discourse for an instant for fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) should escape.
<p/>Almost at the same time that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife left Alexey Alexandrovitch there had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) that bitterest moment in the life of an official--the moment when his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) upward career comes to a full stop.
<p/>This full stop had arrived and everyone perceived it, but Alexey Alexandrovitch himself was not yet aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) career was over.
<p/>Whether it was due to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) feud with Stremov, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) misfortune with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife, or simply that Alexey Alexandrovitch had reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) destined limits, it had become evident to everyone in the course of that year that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) career was at an end.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) still filled a position of consequence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sat on many commissions and committees, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was a man whose day was over, and from whom nothing was expected.
<p/>Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) proposed, was heard as though it were something long familiar, and the very thing that was not needed.
<p/>But Alexey Alexandrovitch was not aware of this, and, on the contrary, being cut off from direct participation in governmental activity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) saw more clearly than ever the errors and defects in the action of others, and thought it his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) duty to point out means for their correction.
<p/>Shortly after his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) separation from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) began writing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) first note on the new judicial procedure, the first of the endless series of notes he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was destined to write in the future.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch did not merely fail to observe his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hopeless position in the official world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was not merely free from anxiety on this head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was positively more satisfied than ever with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own activity.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) may please the Lord: But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) may please his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Apostle</b></font>)</div>says the Apostle Paul, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, who was now guided in every action by Scripture, often recalled this text.
<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) that ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had been left without a wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had in these very projects of reform been serving the Lord more zealously than before.
<p/>The unmistakable impatience of the member of the Council trying to get away from him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) did not trouble Alexey Alexandrovitch; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) gave up his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) exposition only when the member of the Council, seizing his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) chance when one of the Imperial family was passing, slipped away from him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>).
<p/>Left alone, Alexey Alexandrovitch looked down, collecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) thoughts, then looked casually about him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) and walked towards the door, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hoped to meet Countess Lidia Ivanovna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how strong they all are, how sound physically,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>thought Alexey Alexandrovitch, looking at the powerfully built gentleman of the bedchamber with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) well-combed, perfumed whiskers, and at the red neck of the prince, pinched by his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) tight uniform.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had to pass them on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly is it said that all the world is evil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) thought, with another sidelong glance at the calves of the gentleman of the bedchamber.
<p/>Moving forward deliberately, Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) customary air of weariness and dignity to the gentleman who had been talking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and looking towards the door, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes sought Countess Lidia Ivanovna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>said the little old man, with a malicious light in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes, at the moment when Karenin was on a level with them, and was nodding with a frigid gesture, <div class="bookquote">``I haven't congratulated you yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said the old man, pointing to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) newly received ribbon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>answered Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What an  exquisite  day to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) added, laying emphasis in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) peculiar way on the word  exquisite .
<p/>That they laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was well aware, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not expect anything but hostility from them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was used to that by now.
<p/>Catching sight of the yellow shoulders of Lidia Ivanovna jutting out above her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) corset, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) fine pensive eyes bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled, revealing untarnished white teeth, and went towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>Lidia Ivanovna's dress had cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) great pains, as indeed all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) dresses had done of late.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) aim in dress was now quite the reverse of that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had pursued thirty years before.
<p/>Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) desire had been to adorn herself with something, and the more adorned the better.
<p/>Now, on the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was perforce decked out in a way so inconsistent with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) age and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) figure, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) one anxiety was to contrive that the contrast between these adornments and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) own exterior should not be too appalling.
<p/>And as far as Alexey Alexandrovitch was concerned she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) succeeded, and was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes attractive.
<p/>For him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was the one island not only of goodwill to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), but of love in the midst of the sea of hostility and jeering that surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Passing through rows of ironical eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was drawn as naturally to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) loving glance as a plant to the sun.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I congratulate you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) ribbon.
<p/>Suppressing a smile of pleasure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) shoulders, closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes, as though to say that that could not be a source of joy to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Countess Lidia Ivanovna was very well aware that it was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) chief sources of satisfaction, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) never admitted it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is our angel?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div><p/>said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, meaning Seryozha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say I was quite pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyebrows and opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Sitnikov is not satisfied with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As I have mentioned to you, there's a sort of coldness in him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) towards the most important questions which ought to touch the heart of every man and every child...''   (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>Alexey Alexandrovitch began expounding his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) views on the sole question that interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) besides the service--the education of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) son.
<p/>When Alexey Alexandrovitch with Lidia Ivanovna's help had been brought back anew to life and activity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt it his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) duty to undertake the education of the son left on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Having never before taken any interest in educational questions, Alexey Alexandrovitch devoted some time to the theoretical study of the subject.
<p/>After reading several books on anthropology, education, and didactics, Alexey Alexandrovitch drew up a plan of education, and engaging the best tutor in Petersburg to superintend it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) set to work, and the subject continually absorbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but the heart.
<p/>I see in him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) father's heart, and with such a heart a child cannot go far wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lidia Ivanovna/Lidia</b></font>)</div>said Lidia Ivanovna with enthusiasm.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, perhaps....  As for me, I do my duty.
<p/>It's all I can do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're coming to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div>said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, after a pause; <div class="bookquote">``we have to speak of a subject painful for you.
<p/>I would give anything to have spared you certain memories, but others are not of the same mind.
<p/>I have received a letter from  her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) .
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)  is here in Petersburg.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lidia Ivanovna/Lidia</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch shuddered at the allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife, but immediately his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face assumed the deathlike rigidity which expressed utter helplessness in the matter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was expecting it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said.
<p/>Countess Lidia Ivanovna looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) ecstatically, and tears of rapture at the greatness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) soul came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Chapter 25   When Alexey Alexandrovitch came into the Countess Lidia Ivanovna's snug little boudoir, decorated with old china and hung with portraits, the lady herself had not yet made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appearance.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was changing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dress.
<p/>A cloth was laid on a round table, and on it stood a china tea service and a silver spirit-lamp and tea kettle.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch looked idly about at the endless familiar portraits which adorned the room, and sitting down to the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) opened a New Testament lying upon it.
<p/>The rustle of the countess's silk skirt drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) attention off.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well now, we can sit quietly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div>said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, slipping hurriedly with an agitated smile between the table and the sofa, <div class="bookquote">``and talk over our tea.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lidia Ivanovna/Lidia</b></font>)</div><p/>After some words of preparation, Countess Lidia Ivanovna, breathing hard and flushing crimson, gave into Alexey Alexandrovitch's hands the letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had received.
<p/>After reading the letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) sat a long while in silence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I have the right to refuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, timidly lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have forgiven all, and so I cannot deprive her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) of what is exacted by love in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)--by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) son...''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) prays for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), and beseeches God to have mercy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sins.
<p/>And it is better so.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had not thought of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch, evidently agreeing.
<p/>Countess Lidia Ivanovna hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hands and was silent.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was praying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you ask my advice,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said, having finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) prayer and uncovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) face, <div class="bookquote">``I do not advise you to do this.

<p/>If there were a trace of humanity left in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) ought not to wish for it herself.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And Alexey Alexandrovitch consented, and Countess Lidia Ivanovna sent the following letter in French:  ``Dear Madame,  <div class="bookquote">``To be reminded of you might have results for your son in leading to questions on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) part which could not be answered without implanting in the child's soul a spirit of censure towards what should be for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sacred, and therefore I beg you to interpret your husband's refusal in the spirit of Christian love.
<p/>I pray to Almighty God to have mercy on you.
<p/>Countess Lidia''   (<font color='red'><b>Dear Madame</b></font>)</div>This letter attained the secret object which Countess Lidia Ivanovna had concealed from herself.
<p/>It wounded Anna to the quick.
<p/>For his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) part, Alexey Alexandrovitch, on returning home from Lidia Ivanovna's, could not all that day concentrate himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) usual pursuits, and find that spiritual peace of one saved and believing which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had felt of late.
<p/>The thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wife, who had so greatly sinned against him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and towards whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had been so saintly, as Countess Lidia Ivanovna had so justly told him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), ought not to have troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was not easy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not understand the book he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was reading; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not drive away harassing recollections of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) relations with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), of the mistake which, as it now seemed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had made in regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>The memory of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had received her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) confession of infidelity on their way home from the races -LRB-especially that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had insisted only on the observance of external decorum, and had not sent a challenge-RRB- tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) like a remorse.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was tortured too by the thought of the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had written her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>); and most of all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) forgiveness, which nobody wanted, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) care of the other man's child made his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) heart burn with shame and remorse.
<p/>And just the same feeling of shame and regret he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) felt now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) reviewed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) past with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), recalling the awkward words in which, after long wavering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) an offer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how have I been to blame?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said to himself.
<p/>And this question always excited another question in him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)--whether they felt differently, did their loving and marrying differently, these Vronskys and Oblonskys...these gentlemen of the bedchamber, with their fine calves.
<p/>And there passed before his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) mind a whole series of these mettlesome, vigorous, self- confident men, who always and everywhere drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) inquisitive attention in spite of himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) tried to dispel these thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) tried to persuade himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was not living for this transient life, but for the life of eternity, and that there was peace and love in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) heart.
<p/>But the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had in this transient, trivial life made, as it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), a few trivial mistakes tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) as though the eternal salvation in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) believed had no existence.
<p/>But this temptation did not last long, and soon there was reestablished once more in Alexey Alexandrovitch's soul the peace and the elevation by virtue of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could forget what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not want to remember.
<p/>Chapter 26   <div class="bookquote">``Well, Kapitonitch?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seryozha</b></font>)</div><p/>said Seryozha, coming back rosy and good- humored from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) walk the day before his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) birthday, and giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) overcoat to the tall old hall porter, who smiled down at the little person from the height of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) long figure.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, has the bandaged clerk been here today?
<p/>Did papa see him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).
<p/>The minute the chief secretary came out, I announced him (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the hall porter</b></font>)</div>said the hall porter with a good-humored wink.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, I'll take it off.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seryozha!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the tutor</b></font>)</div><p/>said the tutor, stopping in the doorway leading to the inner rooms.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it off yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seryozha</b></font>)</div><p/>But Seryozha, though he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) tutor's feeble voice, did not pay attention to it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) stood keeping hold of the hall porter's belt, and gazing into his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and did papa do what he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) wanted for him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The hall porter</b></font>)</div><p/>The hall porter nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) head affirmatively.
<p/>The clerk with his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) face tied up, who had already been seven times to ask some favor of Alexey Alexandrovitch, interested both Seryozha and the hall porter.
<p/>Seryozha had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) in the hall, and had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) plaintively beg the hall porter to announce him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>), saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) children had death staring them in the face.
<p/>Since then Seryozha, having met him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) a second time in the hall, took great interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, was he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) very glad?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad?
<p/>I should think so!
<p/>Almost dancing as he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) walked away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And has anything been left?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seryozha</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Seryozha, after a pause.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the hall-porter</b></font>)</div>said the hall-porter; then with a shake of his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) head he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Something from the countess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Seryozha understood at once that what the hall porter was speaking of was a present from Countess Lidia Ivanovna for his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) birthday.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say?
<p/>Where?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Korney took it to your papa.
<p/>A fine plaything it must be too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather small, but a fine thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A book.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, a thing.
<p/>Run along, run along, Vassily Lukitch is calling you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div>said the porter, hearing the tutor's steps approaching, and carefully taking away from his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) belt the little hand in the glove half pulled off, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) signed with his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) head towards the tutor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vassily Lukitch, in a tiny minute!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seryozha</b></font>)</div><p/>answered Seryozha with that gay and loving smile which always won over the conscientious Vassily Lukitch.
<p/>Seryozha was too happy, everything was too delightful for him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) to be able to help sharing with his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) friend the porter the family good fortune of which he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had heard during his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) walk in the public gardens from Lidia Ivanovna's niece.
<p/>This piece of good news seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) particularly important from its coming at the same time with the gladness of the bandaged clerk and his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) own gladness at toys having come for him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>).
<p/>It seemed to Seryozha that this was a day on which everyone ought to be glad and happy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know papa's received the Alexander Nevsky today?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure I do!

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is he (<font color='blue'><b>Nevsky</b></font>) glad?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad at the Tsar's gracious favor!
<p/>I should think so!
<p/>It's a proof he (<font color='blue'><b>Tsar</b></font>)'s deserved it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div>said the porter severely and seriously.
<p/>Seryozha fell to dreaming, gazing up at the face of the porter, which he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had thoroughly studied in every detail, especially the chin that hung down between the gray whiskers, never seen by anyone but Seryozha, who saw him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) only from below.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and has your daughter been to see you lately?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The porter</b></font>)</div><p/>The porter's daughter was a ballet dancer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When is she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to come on week-days?
<p/>They've their lessons to learn too.
<p/>And you've your lesson, sir; run along.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seryozha</b></font>)</div><p/>On coming into the room, Seryozha, instead of sitting down to his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) lessons, told his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) tutor of his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) supposition that what had been brought him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) must be a machine.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) inquired.
<p/>But Vassily Lukitch was thinking of nothing but the necessity of learning the grammar lesson for the teacher, who was coming at two.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, do just tell me, Vassily Lukitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) asked suddenly, when he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was seated at their work table with the book in his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) hands, <div class="bookquote">``what is greater than the Alexander Nevsky?
<p/>You know papa's received the Alexander Nevsky?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Vassily Lukitch replied that the Vladimir was greater than the Alexander Nevsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And higher still?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, highest of all is the Andrey Pervozvanny.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And higher than the Andrey?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, you don't know?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seryozha</b></font>)</div><p/>and Seryozha, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) elbows, sank into deep meditation.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) meditations were of the most complex and diverse character.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) imagined his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) father's having suddenly been presented with both the Vladimir and the Andrey today, and in consequence being much better tempered at his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) lesson, and dreamed how, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) was grown up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) would himself receive all the orders, and what they might invent higher than the Andrey.
<p/>Directly any higher order were invented, he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) would win it.
<p/>They would make a higher one still, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) would immediately win that too.
<p/>The time passed in such meditations, and when the teacher came, the lesson about the adverbs of place and time and manner of action was not ready, and the teacher was not only displeased, but hurt.
<p/>This touched Seryozha.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) was not to blame for not having learned the lesson; however much he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) tried, he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) was utterly unable to do that.
<p/>As long as the teacher was explaining to him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) and seemed to comprehend, but as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) was left alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) was positively unable to recollect and to understand that the short and familiar word <div class="bookquote">``suddenly''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>is an adverb of manner of action.
<p/>Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) was sorry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) had disappointed the teacher.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) chose a moment when the teacher was looking in silence at the book.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mihail Ivanitch, when is your birthday?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) asked all, of a sudden.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd much better be thinking about your work.
<p/>Birthdays are of no importance to a rational being.
<p/>It's a day like any other on which one has to do one's work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seryozha</b></font>)</div><p/>Seryozha looked intently at the teacher, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) scanty beard, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) spectacles, which had slipped down below the ridge on his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) nose, and fell into so deep a reverie that he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) heard nothing of what the teacher was explaining to him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) knew that the teacher did not think what he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) said; he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) felt it from the tone in which it was said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why have they all agreed to speak just in the same manner always the dreariest and most useless stuff?
<p/>Why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) keep me off; why doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) love me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) asked himself mournfully, and could not think of an answer.
<p/>Chapter 27   After the lesson with the grammar teacher came his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) father's lesson.
<p/>While waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) father, Seryozha sat at the table playing with a penknife, and fell to dreaming.
<p/>Among Seryozha's favorite occupations was searching for his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) mother during his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) walks.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) did not believe in death generally, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death in particular, in spite of what Lidia Ivanovna had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) father had confirmed, and it was just because of that, and after he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) had been told she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was dead, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) had begun looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) when out for a walk.
<p/>Every woman of full, graceful figure with dark hair was his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) mother.
<p/>At the sight of such a woman such a feeling of tenderness was stirred within him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) breath failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>), and tears came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) was on the tiptoe of expectation that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would come up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>), would lift her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) veil.
<p/>All her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face would be visible, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would smile, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would hug him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) would sniff her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fragrance, feel the softness of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms, and cry with happiness, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) had one evening lain on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lap while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tickled him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) laughed and bit her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) white, ring-covered fingers.
<p/>Later, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) accidentally learned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) old nurse that his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) mother was not dead, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) father and Lidia Ivanovna had explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was dead to him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was wicked -LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) could not possibly believe, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) went on seeking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) and expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) in the same way.
<p/>That day in the public gardens there had been a lady in a lilac veil, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) had watched with a throbbing heart, believing it to be she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came towards them along the path.
<p/>The lady had not come up to them, but had disappeared somewhere.
<p/>That day, more intensely than ever, Seryozha felt a rush of love for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and now, waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) forgot everything, and cut all round the edge of the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) penknife, staring straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) with sparkling eyes and dreaming of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is your papa!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vassily Lukitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vassily Lukitch, rousing him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).
<p/>Seryozha jumped up and went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) father, and kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) hand, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) intently, trying to discover signs of his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) joy at receiving the Alexander Nevsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you have a nice walk?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Alexey Alexandrovitch, sitting down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) easy chair, pulling the volume of the Old Testament to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) and opening it.
<p/>Although Alexey Alexandrovitch had more than once told Seryozha that every Christian ought to know Scripture history thoroughly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) often referred to the Bible himself during the lesson, and Seryozha observed this.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was very nice indeed, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seryozha</b></font>)</div>said Seryozha, sitting sideways on his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) chair and rocking it, which was forbidden.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw Nadinka''  (<font color='red'><b>Nadinka</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Nadinka was a niece of Lidia Ivanovna's who was being brought up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) house-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And secondly, it's not the reward that's precious, but the work itself.
<p/>And I could have wished you understood that.
<p/>If you now are going to work, to study in order to win a reward, then the work will seem hard to you; but when you work''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Alexey Alexandrovitch, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) spoke, thought of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had been sustained by a sense of duty through the wearisome labor of the morning, consisting of signing one hundred and eighty papers-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``loving your work, you will find your reward in it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Seryozha's eyes, that had been shining with gaiety and tenderness, grew dull and dropped before his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) father's gaze.
<p/>This was the same long-familiar tone his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) father always took with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and Seryozha had learned by now to fall in with it.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) father always talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)--so Seryozha felt--as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) were addressing some boy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own imagination, one of those boys that exist in books, utterly unlike himself.
<p/>And Seryozha always tried with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) father to act being the story-book boy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You understand that, I hope?''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) father.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seryozha</b></font>)</div>answered Seryozha, acting the part of the imaginary boy.
<p/>The lesson consisted of learning by heart several verses out of the Gospel and the repetition of the beginning of the Old Testament.
<p/>The verses from the Gospel Seryozha knew fairly well, but at the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was saying them he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) became so absorbed in watching the sharply protruding, bony knobbiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father's forehead, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lost the thread, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) transposed the end of one verse and the beginning of another.
<p/>So it was evident to Alexey Alexandrovitch that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not understand what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was saying, and that irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) frowned, and began explaining what Seryozha had heard many times before and never could remember, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) understood it too well, just as that <div class="bookquote">``suddenly''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>is an adverb of manner of action.
<p/>Seryozha looked with scared eyes at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) father, and could think of nothing but whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) father would make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) repeat what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sometimes did.
<p/>And this thought so alarmed Seryozha that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now understood nothing.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father did not make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) repeat it, and passed on to the lesson out of the Old Testament.
<p/>Seryozha recounted the events themselves well enough, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had to answer questions as to what certain events prefigured, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew nothing, though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had already been punished over this lesson.
<p/>The passage at which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was utterly unable to say anything, and began fidgeting and cutting the table and swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chair, was where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had to repeat the patriarchs before the Flood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not know one of them, except Enoch, who had been taken up alive to heaven.
<p/>Last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) had remembered their names, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) had forgotten them utterly, chiefly because Enoch was the personage he (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) liked best in the whole of the Old Testament, and Enoch's translation to heaven was connected in his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) mind with a whole long train of thought, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) became absorbed now while he (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) gazed with fascinated eyes at his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) father's watch-chain and a half-unbuttoned button on his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) waistcoat.
<p/>In death, of which they talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) so often, Seryozha disbelieved entirely.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) did not believe that those he (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) loved could die, above all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) himself would die.
<p/>That was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) something utterly inconceivable and impossible.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) had been told that all men die; he (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) had asked people, indeed, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) trusted, and they too, had confirmed it; his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) old nurse, too, said the same, though reluctantly.
<p/>But Enoch had not died, and so it followed that everyone did not die.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why cannot anyone else so serve God and be taken alive to heaven?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seryozha</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Seryozha.
<p/>Bad people, that is those Seryozha did not like, they might die, but the good might all be like Enoch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what are the names of the patriarchs?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enoch, Enos--''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you have said that already.
<p/>This is bad, Seryozha, very bad.
<p/>If you don't try to learn what is more necessary than anything for a Christian,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) father, getting up, <div class="bookquote">``whatever can interest you?
<p/>I am displeased with you, and Piotr Ignatitch''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>-LRB-this was the most important of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) teachers-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``is displeased with you....
<p/>I shall have to punish you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>teachers</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) teacher were both displeased with Seryozha, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) certainly did learn his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) lessons very badly.
<p/>But still it could not be said he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was a stupid boy.
<p/>On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was far cleverer than the boys his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) teacher held up as examples to Seryozha.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) father's opinion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) did not want to learn what he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was taught.
<p/>In reality he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) could not learn that.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) could not, because the claims of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) own soul were more binding on him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) than those claims his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) teacher made upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>).
<p/>Those claims were in opposition, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was in direct conflict with his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) education.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was nine years old; he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was a child; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) own soul, it was precious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) guarded it as the eyelid guards the eye, and without the key of love he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) let no one into his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) soul.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) teachers complained that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) would not learn, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) soul was brimming over with thirst for knowledge.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) learned from Kapitonitch, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) nurse, from Nadinka, from Vassily Lukitch, but not from his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) teachers.
<p/>The spring his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) teachers reckoned upon to turn their mill-wheels had long dried up at the source, but its waters did their work in another channel.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) father punished Seryozha by not letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) go to see Nadinka, Lidia Ivanovna's niece; but this punishment turned out happily for Seryozha.
<p/>Vassily Lukitch was in a good humor, and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) how to make windmills.
<p/>The whole evening passed over this work and in dreaming how to make a windmill on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) could turn himself--clutching at the sails or tying himself on and whirling round.
<p/>Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) mother Seryozha did not think all the evening, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had gone to bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) suddenly remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and prayed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) own words that his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) mother tomorrow for his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) birthday might leave off hiding herself and come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vassily Lukitch, do you know what I prayed for tonight extra besides the regular things?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you might learn your lessons better?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Toys?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.
<p/>You'll never guess.
<p/>A splendid thing; but it's a secret!
<p/>When it comes to pass I'll tell you.
<p/>Can't you guess!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I can't guess.
<p/>You tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vassily Lukitch</b></font>)</div>said Vassily Lukitch with a smile, which was rare with him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, lie down, I'm putting out the candle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without the candle I can see better what I see and what I prayed for.
<p/>There!
<p/>I was almost telling the secret!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seryozha</b></font>)</div><p/>said Seryozha, laughing gaily.
<p/>When the candle was taken away, Seryozha heard and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) mother.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood over him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>), and with loving eyes caressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>).
<p/>But then came windmills, a knife, everything began to be mixed up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) fell asleep.
<p/>Chapter 28   On arriving in Petersburg, Vronsky and Anna stayed at one of the best hotels; Vronsky apart in a lower story, Anna above with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) child, its nurse, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) maid, in a large suite of four rooms.
<p/>On the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) arrival Vronsky went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) brother's.
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) mother, who had come from Moscow on business.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) mother and sister-in-law greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) as usual: they asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) stay abroad, and talked of their common acquaintances, but did not let drop a single word in allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) connection with Anna.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) brother came the next morning to see Vronsky, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) own accord asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and Alexey Vronsky told him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) directly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) looked upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) connection with Madame Karenina as marriage; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) hoped to arrange a divorce, and then to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and until then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as much a wife as any other wife, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) to tell their mother and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) wife so.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If the world disapproves, I don't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky; <div class="bookquote">``but if my relations want to be on terms of relationship with me, they will have to be on the same terms with my wife.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>The elder brother, who had always a respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) younger brother's judgment, could not well tell whether he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was right or not till the world had decided the question; for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) part he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had nothing against it, and with Alexey he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) went up to see Anna.
<p/>Before his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) brother, as before everyone, Vronsky addressed Anna with a certain formality, treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) might a very intimate friend, but it was understood that his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) brother knew their real relations, and they talked about Anna's going to Vronsky's estate.
<p/>In spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) social experience Vronsky was, in consequence of the new position in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was placed, laboring under a strange misapprehension.
<p/>One would have thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) must have understood that society was closed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) and Anna; but now some vague ideas had sprung up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) brain that this was only the case in old-fashioned days, and that now with the rapidity of modern progress -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had unconsciously become by now a partisan of every sort of progress-RRB- the views of society had changed, and that the question whether they would be received in society was not a foregone conclusion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would not be received at court, but intimate friends can and must look at it in the proper light.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>One may sit for several hours at a stretch with one's legs crossed in the same position, if one knows that there's nothing to prevent one's changing one's position; but if a man knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must remain sitting so with crossed legs, then cramps come on, the legs begin to twitch and to strain towards the spot to which one would like to draw them.
<p/>This was what Vronsky was experiencing in regard to the world.
<p/>Though at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) knew that the world was shut on them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) put it to the test whether the world had not changed by now and would not receive them.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) very quickly perceived that though the world was open for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) personally, it was closed for Anna.
<p/>Just as in the game of cat and mouse, the hands raised for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) were dropped to bar the way for Anna.
<p/>One of the first ladies of Petersburg society whom Vronsky saw was his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) cousin Betsy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At last!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) joyfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Anna?
<p/>How glad I am!
<p/>Where are you stopping?
<p/>I can fancy after your delightful travels you must find our poor Petersburg horrid.
<p/>I can fancy your honeymoon in Rome.
<p/>How about the divorce?
<p/>Is that all over?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky noticed that Betsy's enthusiasm waned when she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) learned that no divorce had as yet taken place.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``People will throw stones at me, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but I shall come and see Anna; yes, I shall certainly come.
<p/>You won't be here long, I suppose?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did certainly come to see Anna the same day, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tone was not at all the same as in former days.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) unmistakably prided herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) courage, and wished Anna to appreciate the fidelity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) friendship.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) only stayed ten minutes, talking of society gossip, and on leaving she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said:  <div class="bookquote">``You've never told me when the divorce is to be?
<p/>Supposing I'm ready to fling my cap over the mill, other starchy people will give you the cold shoulder until you're married.
<p/>And that's so simple nowadays.
<p/>√áa se fait .
<p/>So you're going on Friday?
<p/>Sorry we shan't see each other again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>From Betsy's tone Vronsky might have grasped what he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had to expect from the world; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) made another effort in his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own family.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mother he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not reckon upon.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mother, who had been so enthusiastic over Anna at their first acquaintance, would have no mercy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) now for having ruined her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son's career.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had more hope of Varya, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) brother's wife.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) would not throw stones, and would go simply and directly to see Anna, and would receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own house.
<p/>The day after his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) arrival Vronsky went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) alone, expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wishes directly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, Alexey,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said after hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``how fond I am of you, and how ready I am to do anything for you; but I have not spoken, because I knew I could be of no use to you and to Anna Arkadyevna,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) said, articulating the name <div class="bookquote">``Anna Arkadyevna''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>with particular care.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't suppose, please, that I judge her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>).
<p/>Never; perhaps in her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) place I should have done the same.
<p/>I don't and can't enter into that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) said, glancing timidly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) gloomy face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But one must call things by their names.
<p/>You want me to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>), to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) here, and to rehabilitate her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) in society; but do understand that I  cannot  do so.
<p/>I have daughters growing up, and I must live in the world for my husband's sake.
<p/>Well, I'm ready to come and see Anna Arkadyevna: she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) will understand that I can't ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) here, or I should have to do so in such a way that she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) would not meet people who look at things differently; that would offend her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>).
<p/>I can't raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>)...''   (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) as fallen more than hundreds of women you do receive!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) still more gloomily, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) got up in silence, understanding that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sister-in-law's decision was not to be shaken.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexey!
<p/>don't be angry with me.
<p/>Please understand that I'm not to blame,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varya</b></font>)</div>began Varya, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) with a timid smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not angry with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) said still as gloomily; <div class="bookquote">``but I'm sorry in two ways.
<p/>I'm sorry, too, that this means breaking up our friendship--if not breaking up, at least weakening it.
<p/>You will understand that for me, too, it cannot be otherwise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And with that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>).
<p/>Vronsky knew that further efforts were useless, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) had to spend these few days in Petersburg as though in a strange town, avoiding every sort of relation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) own old circle in order not to be exposed to the annoyances and humiliations which were so intolerable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>).
<p/>One of the most unpleasant features of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) position in Petersburg was that Alexey Alexandrovitch and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) name seemed to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) everywhere.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not begin to talk of anything without the conversation turning on Alexey Alexandrovitch; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not go anywhere without risk of meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>So at least it seemed to Vronsky, just as it seems to a man with a sore finger that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is continually, as though on purpose, grazing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sore finger on everything.
<p/>Their stay in Petersburg was the more painful to Vronsky that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) perceived all the time a sort of new mood that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not understand in Anna.
<p/>At one time she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would seem in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would become cold, irritable, and impenetrable.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was worrying over something, and keeping something back from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and did not seem to notice the humiliations which poisoned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) existence, and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) delicate intuition, must have been still more unbearable.
<p/>Chapter 29   One of Anna's objects in coming back to Russia had been to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son.
<p/>From the day she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) left Italy the thought of it had never ceased to agitate her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) got nearer to Petersburg, the delight and importance of this meeting grew ever greater in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) imagination.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not even put to herself the question how to arrange it.
<p/>It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) natural and simple to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) should be in the same town with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>But on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) arrival in Petersburg she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was suddenly made distinctly aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) present position in society, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) grasped the fact that to arrange this meeting was no easy matter.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had now been two days in Petersburg.
<p/>The thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son never left her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) for a single instant, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not yet seen him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>To go straight to the house, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) might meet Alexey Alexandrovitch, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had no right to do.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) might be refused admittance and insulted.
<p/>To write and so enter into relations with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband--that it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) miserable to think of doing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could only be at peace when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband.
<p/>To get a glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son out walking, finding out where and when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) went out, was not enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had so looked forward to this meeting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had so much she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) must say to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) so longed to embrace him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>Seryozha's old nurse might be a help to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) and show her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) what to do.
<p/>But the nurse was not now living in Alexey Alexandrovitch's house.
<p/>In this uncertainty, and in efforts to find the nurse, two days had slipped by.
<p/>Hearing of the close intimacy between Alexey Alexandrovitch and Countess Lidia Ivanovna, Anna decided on the third day to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) a letter, which cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) great pains, and in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) intentionally said that permission to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son must depend on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband's generosity.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that if the letter were shown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would keep up his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) character of magnanimity, and would not refuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) request.
<p/>The commissionaire who took the letter had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) back the most cruel and unexpected answer, that there was no answer.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had never felt so humiliated as at the moment when, sending for the commissionaire, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the exact account of how he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had waited, and how afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been told there was no answer.
<p/>Anna felt humiliated, insulted, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw that from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) point of view Countess Lidia Ivanovna was right.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) suffering was the more poignant that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had to bear it in solitude.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not and would not share it with Vronsky.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), although he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was the primary cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) distress, the question of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son would seem a matter of very little consequence.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would never be capable of understanding all the depth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) suffering, that for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) cool tone at any allusion to it she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would begin to hate him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dreaded that more than anything in the world, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hid from him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) everything that related to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son.
<p/>Spending the whole day at home she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) considered ways of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son, and had reached a decision to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was just composing this letter when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was handed the letter from Lidia Ivanovna.
<p/>The countess's silence had subdued and depressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), but the letter, all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) read between the lines in it, so exasperated her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), this malice was so revolting beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) passionate, legitimate tenderness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) son, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) turned against other people and left off blaming herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This coldness--this pretense of feeling!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said to herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They must needs insult me and torture the child, and I am to submit to it!
<p/>Not on any consideration!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is worse than I am.
<p/>I don't lie, anyway.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) decided on the spot that next day, Seryozha's birthday, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would go straight to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) husband's house, bribe or deceive the servants, but at any cost see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) son and overturn the hideous deception with which they were encompassing the unhappy child.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) went to a toy shop, bought toys and thought over a plan of action.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would go early in the morning at eight o'clock, when Alexey Alexandrovitch would be certain not to be up.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would have money in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hand to give the hall porter and the footman, so that they should let her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) in, and not raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) veil, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had come from Seryozha's godfather to congratulate him (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had been charged to leave the toys at his (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>) bedside.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had prepared everything but the words she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) should say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) son.
<p/>Often as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had dreamed of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) could never think of anything.
<p/>The next day, at eight o'clock in the morning, Anna got out of a hired sledge and rang at the front entrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) former home.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Run and see what's wanted.
<p/>Some lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kapitonitch</b></font>)</div>said Kapitonitch, who, not yet dressed, in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) overcoat and galoshes, had peeped out of the window and seen a lady in a veil standing close up to the door.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) assistant, a lad Anna did not know, had no sooner opened the door to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) came in, and pulling a three-rouble note out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) muff put it hurriedly into his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seryozha--Sergey Alexeitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, and was going on.
<p/>Scrutinizing the note, the porter's assistant stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) at the second glass door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom do you want?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) asked.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not hear his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) words and made no answer.
<p/>Noticing the embarrassment of the unknown lady, Kapitonitch went out to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), opened the second door for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was pleased to want.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``From Prince Skorodumov for Sergey Alexeitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Alexeitch</b></font>) honor's not up yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div>said the porter, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) attentively.
<p/>Anna had not anticipated that the absolutely unchanged hall of the house where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had lived for nine years would so greatly affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Memories sweet and painful rose one after another in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart, and for a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) forgot what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was here for.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you kindly wait?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kapitonitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Kapitonitch, taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fur cloak.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) took off the cloak, Kapitonitch glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face, recognized her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) a low bow in silence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please walk in, your excellency,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tried to say something, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) voice refused to utter any sound; with a guilty and imploring glance at the old man she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went with light, swift steps up the stairs.
<p/>Bent double, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bent</b></font>) galoshes catching in the steps, Kapitonitch ran after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), trying to overtake her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The tutor's there; maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Bent</b></font>)'s not dressed.
<p/>I'll let him (<font color='blue'><b>Bent</b></font>) know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna still mounted the familiar staircase, not understanding what the old man was saying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This way, to the left, if you please.
<p/>Excuse its not being tidy.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) honor's in the old parlor now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the hall porter</b></font>)</div>the hall porter said, panting.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, wait a little, your excellency; I'll just see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) said, and overtaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) opened the high door and disappeared behind it.
<p/>Anna stood still waiting.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>)'s only just awake,''  (<font color='red'><b>the hall porter</b></font>)</div>said the hall porter, coming out.
<p/>And at the very instant the porter said this, Anna caught the sound of a childish yawn.
<p/>From the sound of this yawn alone she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son and seemed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) living before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me in; go away!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, and went in through the high doorway.
<p/>On the right of the door stood a bed, and sitting up in the bed was the boy.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) little body bent forward with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nightshirt unbuttoned, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was stretching and still yawning.
<p/>The instant his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lips came together they curved into a blissfully sleepy smile, and with that smile he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) slowly and deliciously rolled back again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seryozha!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) whispered, going noiselessly up to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was parted from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and all this latter time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been feeling a fresh rush of love for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had pictured him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was at four years old, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) most of all.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was not even the same as when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had left him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was still further from the four-year-old baby, more grown and thinner.
<p/>How thin his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face was, how short his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hair was!
<p/>What long hands!
<p/>How he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had changed since she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!
<p/>But it was he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lips, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) soft neck and broad little shoulders.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seryozha!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) repeated just in the child's ear.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) raised himself again on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) elbow, turned his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tangled head from side to side as though looking for something, and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Slowly and inquiringly he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked for several seconds at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother standing motionless before him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), then all at once he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) smiled a blissful smile, and shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes, rolled not backwards but towards her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seryozha!
<p/>my darling boy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, breathing hard and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) plump little body.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, wriggling about in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms so as to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands with different parts of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>Smiling sleepily still with closed eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) flung fat little arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shoulders, rolled towards her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), with the delicious sleepy warmth and fragrance that is only found in children, and began rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face against her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) neck and shoulders.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes; <div class="bookquote">``it's my birthday today.
<p/>I knew you'd come.
<p/>I'll get up directly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dropped asleep.
<p/>Anna looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hungrily; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw how he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had grown and changed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) absence.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew, and did not know, the bare legs so long now, that were thrust out below the quilt, those short-cropped curls on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) neck in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had so often kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) touched all this and could say nothing; tears choked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you crying for, mother?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, waking completely up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, what are you crying for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cried in a tearful voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't cry...I'm crying for joy.
<p/>It's so long since I've seen you.
<p/>I won't, I won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) said, gulping down her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) tears and turning away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, it's time for you to dress now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) added, after a pause, and, never letting go his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) sat down by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bedside on the chair, where his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) clothes were put ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you dress without me?
<p/>How...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) tried to begin talking simply and cheerfully, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) could not, and again she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) turned away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't have a cold bath, papa didn't order it.
<p/>And you've not seen Vassily Lukitch?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'ll come in soon.

 (<font color='red'><b>Seryozha</b></font>)</div><p/>And Seryozha went off into a peal of laughter.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) and smiled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, darling, sweet one!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) shouted, flinging himself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) again and hugging her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>).
<p/>It was as though only now, on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) smile, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) fully grasped what had happened.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want that on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) said, taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) hat.
<p/>And as it were, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) afresh without her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) hat, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) fell to kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what did you think about me?
<p/>You didn't think I was dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) favorite phrase, and snatching the hand that was stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) hair, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) pressed the open palm to his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) mouth and kissed it.
<p/>Chapter 30   Meanwhile Vassily Lukitch had not at first understood who this lady was, and had learned from their conversation that it was no other person than the mother who had left her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had not seen, as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had entered the house after her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) departure.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was in doubt whether to go in or not, or whether to communicate with Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>Reflecting finally that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) duty was to get Seryozha up at the hour fixed, and that it was therefore not his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) business to consider who was there, the mother or anyone else, but simply to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) duty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) finished dressing, went to the door and opened it.
<p/>But the embraces of the mother and child, the sound of their voices, and what they were saying, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) change his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head, and with a sigh he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) closed the door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll wait another ten minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said to himself, clearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) throat and wiping away tears.
<p/>Among the servants of the household there was intense excitement all this time.
<p/>All had heard that their mistress had come, and that Kapitonitch had let her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) in, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was even now in the nursery, and that their master always went in person to the nursery at nine o'clock, and every one fully comprehended that it was impossible for the husband and wife to meet, and that they must prevent it.
<p/>Korney, the valet, going down to the hall porter's room, asked who had let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in, and how it was he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had done so, and ascertaining that Kapitonitch had admitted her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and shown her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) up, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) gave the old man a talking-to.
<p/>The hall porter was doggedly silent, but when Korney told him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) ought to be sent away, Kapitonitch darted up to him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>), and waving his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) hands in Korney's face, began:  <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, to be sure you'd not have let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in!
<p/>After ten years' service, and never a word but of kindness, and there you'd up and say, `Be off, go along, get away with you!'
<p/>Oh yes, you're a shrewd one at politics, I dare say!
<p/>You don't need to be taught how to swindle the master, and to filch fur coats!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Korney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Soldier!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Korney</b></font>)</div><p/>said Korney contemptuously, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) turned to the nurse who was coming in.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, what do you think, Marya Efimovna: he (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) in without a word to anyone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Korney</b></font>)</div>Korney said addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexey Alexandrovitch will be down immediately--and go into the nursery!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A pretty business, a pretty business!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div><p/>said the nurse.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, Korney Vassilievitch, you'd best keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) some way or other, the master, while I'll run and get her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) away somehow.
<p/>A pretty business!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div><p/>When the nurse went into the nursery, Seryozha was telling his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) mother how he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) and Nadinka had had a fall in sledging downhill, and had turned over three times.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was listening to the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) voice, watching his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) face and the play of expression on it, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hand, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not follow what he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was saying.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must go, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must leave him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>),--this was the only thing she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was thinking and feeling.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heard the steps of Vassily Lukitch coming up to the door and coughing; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heard, too, the steps of the nurse as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) came near; but she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) sat like one turned to stone, incapable of beginning to speak or to get up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mistress, darling!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div><p/>began the nurse, going up to Anna and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hands and shoulders.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``God has brought joy indeed to our boy on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) birthday.
<p/>You aren't changed one bit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nurse dear, I didn't know you were in the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, rousing herself for a moment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not living here, I'm living with my daughter.
<p/>I came for the birthday, Anna Arkadyevna, darling!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The nurse</b></font>)</div><p/>The nurse suddenly burst into tears, and began kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) hand again.
<p/>Seryozha, with radiant eyes and smiles, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother by one hand and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) nurse by the other, pattered on the rug with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fat little bare feet.
<p/>The tenderness shown by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) beloved nurse to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother threw him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) into an ecstasy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) often comes to see me, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) comes...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was beginning, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stopped, noticing that the nurse was saying something in a whisper to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother, and that in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother's face there was a look of dread and something like shame, which was so strangely unbecoming to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My sweet!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not say  good-bye , but the expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face said it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) understood.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Darling, darling Kootik!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used the name by which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had called him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was little, <div class="bookquote">``you won't forget me?
<p/>You...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not say more.
<p/>How often afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought of words she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might have said.
<p/>But now she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not know how to say it, and could say nothing.
<p/>But Seryozha knew all she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wanted to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was unhappy and loved him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) understood even what the nurse had whispered.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had caught the words <div class="bookquote">``always at nine o'clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew that this was said of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father and mother could not meet.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) understood, but one thing he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could not understand--why there should be a look of dread and shame in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face?...
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was not in fault, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and ashamed of something.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would have liked to put a question that would have set at rest this doubt, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not dare; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was miserable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>Silently he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pressed close to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Don't go yet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) won't come just yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The mother held him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) away from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was thinking, what to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) frightened face she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) read not only that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was speaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father, but, as it were, asking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ought to think about his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seryozha, my darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``love him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s better and kinder than I am, and I have done him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wrong.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cried in despair through his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) tears, and, clutching her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) by the shoulders, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) began squeezing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) force to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) arms trembling with the strain.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My sweet, my little one!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cried as weakly and childishly as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>At that moment the door opened.
<p/>Vassily Lukitch came in.
<p/>At the other door there was the sound of steps, and the nurse in a scared whisper said, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>and gave Anna her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hat.
<p/>Seryozha sank onto the bed and sobbed, hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Anna removed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands, once more kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wet face, and with rapid steps went to the door.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch walked in, meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) stopped short and bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head.
<p/>Although she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had just said he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was better and kinder than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), in the rapid glance she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) flung at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), taking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) whole figure in all its details, feelings of repulsion and hatred for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) and jealousy over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son took possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>With a swift gesture she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) veil, and, quickening her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pace, almost ran out of the room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not time to undo, and so carried back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), the parcel of toys she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had chosen the day before in a toy shop with such love and sorrow.
<p/>Chapter 31   As intensely as Anna had longed to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son, and long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been thinking of it and preparing herself for it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not in the least expected that seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) so deeply.
<p/>On getting back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lonely rooms in the hotel she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not for a long while understand why she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was there.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's all over, and I am again alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to herself, and without taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hat she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sat down in a low chair by the hearth.
<p/>Fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes on a bronze clock standing on a table between the windows, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tried to think.
<p/>The French maid brought from abroad came in to suggest she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) should dress.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) wonderingly and said, <div class="bookquote">``Presently.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>A footman offered her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) coffee.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Later on,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) said.
<p/>The Italian nurse, after having taken the baby out in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) best, came in with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) to Anna.
<p/>The plump, well-fed little baby, on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mother, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) always did, held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fat little hands, and with a smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) toothless mouth, began, like a fish with a float, bobbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fingers up and down the starched folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) embroidered skirt, making them rustle.
<p/>It was impossible not to smile, not to kiss the baby, impossible not to hold out a finger for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to clutch, crowing and prancing all over; impossible not to offer her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) a lip which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sucked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) little mouth by way of a kiss.
<p/>And all this Anna did, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) arms and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dance, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fresh little cheek and bare little elbows; but at the sight of this child it was plainer than ever to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that the feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not be called love in comparison with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt for Seryozha.
<p/>Everything in this baby was charming, but for some reason all this did not go deep to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart.
<p/>On her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) first child, though the child of an unloved father, had been concentrated all the love that had never found satisfaction.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) baby girl had been born in the most painful circumstances and had not had a hundredth part of the care and thought which had been concentrated on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) first child.
<p/>Besides, in the little girl everything was still in the future, while Seryozha was by now almost a personality, and a personality dearly loved.
<p/>In him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) there was a conflict of thought and feeling; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) judged her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought, recalling his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) words and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was forever--not physically only but spiritually--divided from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and it was impossible to set this right.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) gave the baby back to the nurse, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) go, and opened the locket in which there was Seryozha's portrait when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was almost of the same age as the girl.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) got up, and, taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hat, took up from a little table an album in which there were photographs of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) son at different ages.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wanted to compare them, and began taking them out of the album.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took them all out except one, the latest and best photograph.
<p/>In it he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was in a white smock, sitting astride a chair, with frowning eyes and smiling lips.
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) best, most characteristic expression.
<p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) little supple hands, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) white, delicate fingers, that moved with a peculiar intensity today, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pulled at a corner of the photograph, but the photograph had caught somewhere, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not get it out.
<p/>There was no paper knife on the table, and so, pulling out the photograph that was next to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) son's -LRB-it was a photograph of Vronsky taken at Rome in a round hat and with long hair-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) used it to push out her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) son's photograph.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, here is he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, glancing at the portrait of Vronsky, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) suddenly recalled that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) present misery.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not once thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) all the morning.
<p/>But now, coming all at once upon that manly, noble face, so familiar and so dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt a sudden rush of love for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But where is he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)?
<p/>How is it he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) leaves me alone in my misery?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought all at once with a feeling of reproach, forgetting she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had herself kept from him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) everything concerning her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) son.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sent to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) immediately; with a throbbing heart she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), rehearsing to herself the words in which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) all, and the expressions of love with which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would console her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>The messenger returned with the answer that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had a visitor with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), but that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would come immediately, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) asked whether she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would let him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) bring with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Prince Yashvin, who had just arrived in Petersburg.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s not coming alone, and since dinner yesterday he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has not seen me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s not coming so that I could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) everything, but coming with Yashvin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And all at once a strange idea came to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>): what if he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) had ceased to love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?
<p/>And going over the events of the last few days, it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw in everything a confirmation of this terrible idea.
<p/>The fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) had not dined at home yesterday, and the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) had insisted on their taking separate sets of rooms in Petersburg, and that even now he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) was not coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) alone, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) were trying to avoid meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face to face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) ought to tell me so.
<p/>I must know that it is so.
<p/>If I knew it, then I know what I should do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said to herself, utterly unable to picture to herself the position she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would be in if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) not caring for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) had ceased to love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt close upon despair, and consequently she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt exceptionally alert.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rang for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) maid and went to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dressing room.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dressed, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took more care over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) appearance than she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had done all those days, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) might, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) had grown cold to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), fall in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) again because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had dressed and arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair in the way most becoming to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heard the bell ring before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was ready.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went into the drawing room it was not he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>), but Yashvin, who met her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Vronsky was looking through the photographs of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) son, which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had forgotten on the table, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) made no haste to look round at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have met already,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) little hand into the huge hand of Yashvin, whose bashfulness was so queerly out of keeping with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) immense frame and coarse face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We met last year at the races.
<p/>Give them to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, with a rapid movement snatching from Vronsky the photographs of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) son, and glancing significantly at him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) with flashing eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were the races good this year?
<p/>Instead of them I saw the races in the Corso in Rome.
<p/>But you don't care for life abroad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said with a cordial smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you and all your tastes, though I have seen so little of you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm awfully sorry for that, for my tastes are mostly bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Yashvin/Prince Yashvin</b></font>)</div>said Yashvin, gnawing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) left mustache.
<p/>Having talked a little while, and noticing that Vronsky glanced at the clock, Yashvin asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) whether she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would be staying much longer in Petersburg, and unbending his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) huge figure reached after his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) cap.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not long, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said hesitatingly, glancing at Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So then we shan't meet again?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and dine with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna resolutely, angry it seemed with herself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) embarrassment, but flushing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) always did when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) defined her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) position before a fresh person.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dinner here is not good, but at least you will see him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>).
<p/>There is no one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) old friends in the regiment Alexey cares for as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) does for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Delighted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Yashvin/Prince Yashvin</b></font>)</div>said Yashvin with a smile, from which Vronsky could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) liked Anna very much.
<p/>Yashvin said good-bye and went away; Vronsky stayed behind.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going too?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm late already,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Run along!
<p/>I'll catch you up in a moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) called to Yashvin.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) by the hand, and without taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes off him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>), gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ransacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mind for the words to say that would keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute, there's something I want to say to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) broad hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pressed it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) neck.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, was it right my asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) to dinner?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) said with a serene smile that showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) even teeth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexey, you have not changed to me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) hand in both of hers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexey, I am miserable here.
<p/>When are we going away?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Soon, soon.
<p/>You wouldn't believe how disagreeable our way of living here is to me too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) drew away his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, go, go!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said in a tone of offense, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) walked quickly away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 32   When Vronsky returned home, Anna was not yet home.
<p/>Soon after he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had left, some lady, so they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), had come to see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had gone out with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>That she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had gone out without leaving word where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was going, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not yet come back, and that all the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been going about somewhere without a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)--all this, together with the strange look of excitement in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face in the morning, and the recollection of the hostile tone with which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had before Yashvin almost snatched her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son's photographs out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) hands, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) serious.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) decided he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) absolutely must speak openly with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) drawing room.
<p/>But Anna did not return alone, but brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) old unmarried aunt, Princess Oblonskaya.
<p/>This was the lady who had come in the morning, and with whom Anna had gone out shopping.
<p/>Anna appeared not to notice Vronsky's worried and inquiring expression, and began a lively account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) morning's shopping.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) saw that there was something working within her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>); in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) flashing eyes, when they rested for a moment on him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>), there was an intense concentration, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) words and movements there was that nervous rapidity and grace which, during the early period of their intimacy, had so fascinated him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>), but which now so disturbed and alarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>).
<p/>The dinner was laid for four.
<p/>All were gathered together and about to go into the little dining room when Tushkevitch made his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) appearance with a message from Princess Betsy.
<p/>Princess Betsy begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) to excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) not having come to say good-bye; she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) had been indisposed, but begged Anna to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) between half-past six and nine o'clock.
<p/>Vronsky glanced at Anna at the precise limit of time, so suggestive of steps having been taken that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) should meet no one; but Anna appeared not to notice it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very sorry that I can't come just between half-past six and nine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said with a faint smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The princess will be very sorry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so am I.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tushkevitch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're going, no doubt, to hear Patti?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tushkevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Tushkevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Patti?
<p/>You suggest the idea to me.
<p/>I would go if it were possible to get a box.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can get one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tushkevitch</b></font>)</div>Tushkevitch offered his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) services.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be very, very grateful to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But won't you dine with us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky gave a hardly perceptible shrug.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) was at a complete loss to understand what Anna was about.
<p/>What had she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) brought the old Princess Oblonskaya home for, what had she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) made Tushkevitch stay to dinner for, and, most amazing of all, why was she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sending him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) for a box?
<p/>Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) possibly think in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) position of going to Patti's benefit, where all the circle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) acquaintances would be?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with serious eyes, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) responded with that defiant, half-mirthful, half-desperate look, the meaning of which he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) could not comprehend.
<p/>At dinner Anna was in aggressively high spirits--she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) almost flirted both with Tushkevitch and with Yashvin.
<p/>When they got up from dinner and Tushkevitch had gone to get a box at the opera, Yashvin went to smoke, and Vronsky went down with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) own rooms.
<p/>After sitting there for some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) ran upstairs.
<p/>Anna was already dressed in a low-necked gown of light silk and velvet that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had had made in Paris, and with costly white lace on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head, framing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face, and particularly becoming, showing up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dazzling beauty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you really going to the theater?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said, trying not to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you ask with such alarm?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, wounded again at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't I go?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) appeared not to understand the motive of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, of course, there's no reason whatever,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said, frowning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just what I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, willfully refusing to see the irony of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) tone, and quietly turning back her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) long, perfumed glove.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna, for God's sake!
<p/>what is the matter with you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, appealing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) exactly as once her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband had done.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand what you are asking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that it's out of the question to go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so?
<p/>I'm not going alone.
<p/>Princess Varvara has gone to dress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) is going with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shoulders with an air of perplexity and despair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But do you mean to say you don't know?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) began.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't care to know!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) almost shrieked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care to.
<p/>Do I regret what I have done?
<p/>No, no, no!
<p/>If it were all to do again from the beginning, it would be the same.
<p/>For us, for you and for me, there is only one thing that matters, whether we love each other.
<p/>Other people we need not consider.
<p/>Why are we living here apart and not seeing each other?
<p/>Why can't I go?
<p/>I love you, and I don't care for anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said in Russian, glancing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) with a peculiar gleam in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) could not understand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you have not changed to me, why don't you look at me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) saw all the beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face and full dress, always so becoming to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>But now her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) beauty and elegance were just what irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My feeling cannot change, you know, but I beg you, I entreat you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) said again in French, with a note of tender supplication in his (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) voice, but with coldness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did not hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) words, but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) saw the coldness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) eyes, and answered with irritation:  <div class="bookquote">``And I beg you to explain why I should not go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it might cause you...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) hesitated.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand.
<p/>Yashvin  n'est pas compromettant , and Princess Varvara is no worse than others.
<p/>Oh, here she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chapter Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 33   Vronsky for the first time experienced a feeling of anger against Anna, almost a hatred for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) willfully refusing to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own position.
<p/>This feeling was aggravated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) being unable to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) plainly the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) anger.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) directly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) was thinking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) would have said:  <div class="bookquote">``In that dress, with a princess only too well known to everyone, to show yourself at the theater is equivalent not merely to acknowledging your position as a fallen woman, but is flinging down a challenge to society, that is to say, cutting yourself off from it forever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) could not say that to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how can she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fail to see it, and what is going on in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) said to himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) felt at the same time that his (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) respect for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was diminished while his (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beauty was intensified.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) went back scowling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) rooms, and sitting down beside Yashvin, who, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) long legs stretched out on a chair, was drinking brandy and seltzer water, he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) ordered a glass of the same for himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were talking of Lankovsky's Powerful.
<p/>That's a fine horse, and I would advise you to buy him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Yashvin/Prince Yashvin</b></font>)</div>said Yashvin, glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) comrade's gloomy face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) hind-quarters aren't quite first-rate, but the legs and head--one couldn't wish for anything better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I will take him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>answered Vronsky.
<p/>Their conversation about horses interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) did not for an instant forget Anna, and could not help listening to the sound of steps in the corridor and looking at the clock on the chimney piece.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna Arkadyevna gave orders to announce that she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) has gone to the theater.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Yashvin/Prince Yashvin</b></font>)</div><p/>Yashvin, tipping another glass of brandy into the bubbling water, drank it and got up, buttoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) coat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let's go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) said, faintly smiling under his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) mustache, and showing by this smile that he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) knew the cause of Vronsky's gloominess, and did not attach any significance to it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>Vronsky answered gloomily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I must, I promised to.
<p/>Good-bye, then.
<p/>If you do, come to the stalls; you can take Kruzin's stall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Yashvin/Prince Yashvin</b></font>)</div>added Yashvin as he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) went out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm busy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A wife is a care, but it's worse when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s not a wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Yashvin/Prince Yashvin</b></font>)</div>thought Yashvin, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) walked out of the hotel.
<p/>Vronsky, left alone, got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) chair and began pacing up and down the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what's today?
<p/>The fourth night....  Yegor and his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) wife are there, and my mother, most likely.
<p/>Of course all Petersburg's there.
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s gone in, taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cloak and come into the light.
<p/>Tushkevitch, Yashvin, Princess Varvara,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) pictured them to himself...  <div class="bookquote">``What about me?
<p/>Either that I'm frightened or have given up to Tushkevitch the right to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)?
<p/>From every point of view--stupid, stupid!...
<p/>And why is she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) putting me in such a position?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) said with a gesture of despair.
<p/>With that gesture he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) knocked against the table, on which there was standing the seltzer water and the decanter of brandy, and almost upset it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) tried to catch it, let it slip, and angrily kicked the table over and rang.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you care to be in my service,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) said to the valet who came in, <div class="bookquote">``you had better remember your duties.
<p/>This shouldn't be here.
<p/>You ought to have cleared away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the valet</b></font>)</div><p/>The valet, conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) own innocence, would have defended himself, but glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) master, he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) saw from his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) face that the only thing to do was to be silent, and hurriedly threading his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) way in and out, dropped down on the carpet and began gathering up the whole and broken glasses and bottles.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not your duty; send the waiter to clear away, and get my dress coat out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky went into the theater at half-past eight.
<p/>The performance was in full swing.
<p/>The little old box-keeper, recognizing Vronsky as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) off with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) fur coat, called him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Your Excellency,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and suggested he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) should not take a number but should simply call Fyodor.
<p/>In the brightly lighted corridor there was no one but the box-opener and two attendants with fur cloaks on their arms listening at the doors.
<p/>Through the closed doors came the sounds of the discreet  staccato  accompaniment of the orchestra, and a single female voice rendering distinctly a musical phrase.
<p/>The door opened to let the box-opener slip through, and the phrase drawing to the end reached Vronsky's hearing clearly.
<p/>But the doors were closed again at once, and Vronsky did not hear the end of the phrase and the cadence of the accompaniment, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) knew from the thunder of applause that it was over.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) entered the hall, brilliantly lighted with chandeliers and gas jets, the noise was still going on.
<p/>On the stage the singer, bowing and smiling, with bare shoulders flashing with diamonds, was, with the help of the tenor who had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) arm, gathering up the bouquets that were flying awkwardly over the footlights.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) went up to a gentleman with glossy pomaded hair parted down the center, who was stretching across the footlights holding out something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), and all the public in the stalls as well as in the boxes was in excitement, craning forward, shouting and clapping.
<p/>The conductor in his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) high chair assisted in passing the offering, and straightened his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) white tie.
<p/>Vronsky walked into the middle of the stalls, and, standing still, began looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>).
<p/>That day less than ever was his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) attention turned upon the familiar, habitual surroundings, the stage, the noise, all the familiar, uninteresting, particolored herd of spectators in the packed theater.
<p/>There were, as always, the same ladies of some sort with officers of some sort in the back of the boxes; the same gaily dressed women--God knows who--and uniforms and black coats; the same dirty crowd in the upper gallery; and among the crowd, in the boxes and in the front rows, were some forty of the  real  people.
<p/>And to those oases Vronsky at once directed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) attention, and with them he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) entered at once into relation.
<p/>The act was over when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went in, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not go straight to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) brother's box, but going up to the first row of stalls stopped at the footlights with Serpuhovskoy, who, standing with one knee raised and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heel on the footlights, caught sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in the distance and beckoned to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), smiling.
<p/>Vronsky had not yet seen Anna.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) purposely avoided looking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) direction.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew by the direction of people's eyes where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looked round discreetly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was not seeking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>); expecting the worst, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes sought for Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>To his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) relief Alexey Alexandrovitch was not in the theater that evening.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How little of the military man there is left in you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Serpuhovskoy</b></font>)</div><p/>Serpuhovskoy was saying to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A diplomat, an artist, something of that sort, one would say.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was like going back home when I put on a black coat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>answered Vronsky, smiling and slowly taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>) opera glass.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll own I envy you there.
<p/>When I come back from abroad and put on this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>) touched his (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>) epaulets, <div class="bookquote">``I regret my freedom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Serpuhovskoy had long given up all hope of Vronsky's career, but he (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>) as before, and was now particularly cordial to him (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity you were not in time for the first act!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky, listening with one ear, moved his (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>) opera glass from the stalls and scanned the boxes.
<p/>Near a lady in a turban and a bald old man, who seemed to wave angrily in the moving opera glass, Vronsky suddenly caught sight of Anna's head, proud, strikingly beautiful, and smiling in the frame of lace.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was in the fifth box, twenty paces from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was sitting in front, and slightly turning, was saying something to Yashvin.
<p/>The setting of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) handsome, broad shoulders, and the restrained excitement and brilliance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) whole face reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) at the ball in Moscow.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) felt utterly different towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) beauty now.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) feeling for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) now there was no element of mystery, and so her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) beauty, though it attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) even more intensely than before, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) now a sense of injury.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was not looking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) direction, but Vronsky felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) already.
<p/>When Vronsky turned the opera glass again in that direction, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) noticed that Princess Varvara was particularly red, and kept laughing unnaturally and looking round at the next box.
<p/>Anna, folding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fan and tapping it on the red velvet, was gazing away and did not see, and obviously did not wish to see, what was taking place in the next box.
<p/>Yashvin's face wore the expression which was common when he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) was losing at cards.
<p/>Scowling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) sucked the left end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) mustache further and further into his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) mouth, and cast sidelong glances at the next box.
<p/>In that box on the left were the Kartasovs.
<p/>Vronsky knew them, and knew that Anna was acquainted with them.
<p/>Madame Kartasova, a thin little woman, was standing up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) box, and, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) back turned upon Anna, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was putting on a mantle that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband was holding for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face was pale and angry, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was talking excitedly.
<p/>Kartasov, a fat, bald man, was continually looking round at Anna, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attempted to soothe his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.
<p/>When the wife had gone out, the husband lingered a long while, and tried to catch Anna's eye, obviously anxious to bow to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>But Anna, with unmistakable intention, avoided noticing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and talked to Yashvin, whose cropped head was bent down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Kartasov went out without making his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) salutation, and the box was left empty.
<p/>Vronsky could not understand exactly what had passed between the Kartasovs and Anna, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) saw that something humiliating for Anna had happened.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) knew this both from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) had seen, and most of all from the face of Anna, who, he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) could see, was taxing every nerve to carry through the part she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had taken up.
<p/>And in maintaining this attitude of external composure she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was completely successful.
<p/>Anyone who did not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) circle, who had not heard all the utterances of the women expressive of commiseration, indignation, and amazement, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) should show herself in society, and show herself so conspicuously with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lace and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) beauty, would have admired the serenity and loveliness of this woman without a suspicion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was undergoing the sensations of a man in the stocks.
<p/>Knowing that something had happened, but not knowing precisely what, Vronsky felt a thrill of agonizing anxiety, and hoping to find out something, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) went towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) brother's box.
<p/>Purposely choosing the way round furthest from Anna's box, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) jostled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) came out against the colonel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) old regiment talking to two acquaintances.
<p/>Vronsky heard the name of Madame Karenina, and noticed how the colonel hastened to address Vronsky loudly by name, with a meaning glance at his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) companions.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Vronsky!
<p/>When are you coming to the regiment?
<p/>We can't let you off without a supper.
<p/>You're one of the old set,''  (<font color='red'><b>the colonel</b></font>)</div>said the colonel of his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) regiment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't stop, awfully sorry, another time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) ran upstairs towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) brother's box.
<p/>The old countess, Vronsky's mother, with her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) steel-gray curls, was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) brother's box.
<p/>Varya with the young Princess Sorokina met him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) in the corridor.
<p/>Leaving the Princess Sorokina with her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) mother, Varya held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) brother-in-law, and began immediately to speak of what interested him (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) was more excited than he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) had ever seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it's mean and hateful, and Madame Kartasova had no right to do it.
<p/>Madame Karenina...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) began.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is it?
<p/>I don't know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?
<p/>you've not heard?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I should be the last person to hear of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There isn't a more spiteful creature than that Madame Kartasova!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what did she (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My husband told me....  She (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) has insulted Madame Karenina.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) husband began talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) across the box, and Madame Kartasova made a scene.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Varya</b></font>) said something aloud, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) says, something insulting, and went away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Count, your maman is asking for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sorokina/Princess Sorokina</b></font>)</div>said the young Princess Sorokina, peeping out of the door of the box.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been expecting you all the while,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother, smiling sarcastically.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were nowhere to be seen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not suppress a smile of delight.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good evening, maman.
<p/>I have come to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said coldly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why aren't you going to  faire la cour √† Madame Karenina ?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went on, when Princess Sorokina had moved away.  ''
<p/>Elle fait sensation.
<p/>On oublie la Patti pour elle .''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maman, I have asked you not to say anything to me of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) answered, scowling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm only saying what everyone's saying.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky made no reply, and saying a few words to Princess Sorokina, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) went away.
<p/>At the door he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Alexey!''
 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How disgusting!
<p/>Idiot of a woman, nothing else....
<p/>I wanted to go straight to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Let's go together.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky did not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>).
<p/>With rapid steps he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) went downstairs; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) must do something, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) did not know what.
<p/>Anger with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for having put herself and him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) in such a false position, together with pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suffering, filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) went down, and made straight for Anna's box.
<p/>At her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) box stood Stremov, talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are no more tenors.
<p/>Le moule en est bris√©! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky bowed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and stopped to greet Stremov.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You came in late, I think, and have missed the best song,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>Anna said to Vronsky, glancing ironically, he (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) thought, at him (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a poor judge of music,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) said, looking sternly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like Prince Yashvin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said smiling, <div class="bookquote">``who considers that Patti sings too loud.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Patti</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Patti</b></font>) little hand in its long glove taking the playbill Vronsky picked up, and suddenly at that instant her (<font color='blue'><b>Patti</b></font>) lovely face quivered.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Patti</b></font>) got up and went into the interior of the box.
<p/>Noticing in the next act that her (<font color='blue'><b>Patti</b></font>) box was empty, Vronsky, rousing indignant <div class="bookquote">``hushes''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>in the silent audience, went out in the middle of a solo and drove home.
<p/>Anna was already at home.
<p/>When Vronsky went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was in the same dress as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had worn at the theater.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was sitting in the first armchair against the wall, looking straight before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), and at once resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) former position.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, you are to blame for everything!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cried, with tears of despair and hatred in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) voice, getting up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I begged, I implored you not to go, I knew it would be unpleasant...''   (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Unpleasant!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cried--<div class="bookquote">``hideous!
<p/>As long as I live I shall never forget it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said it was a disgrace to sit beside me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A silly woman's chatter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``but why risk it, why provoke?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate your calm.
<p/>You ought not to have brought me to this.
<p/>If you had loved me...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anna!
<p/>How does the question of my love come in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you loved me, as I love, if you were tortured as I am!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) with an expression of terror.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and angry notwithstanding.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) love because he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) saw that this was the only means of soothing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) did not reproach her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in words, but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) reproached her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>And the asseverations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) love, which seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) so vulgar that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was ashamed to utter them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) drank in eagerly, and gradually became calmer.
<p/>The next day, completely reconciled, they left for the country.
<p/>PART 6     Chapter 1    Darya Alexandrovna spent the summer with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) children at Pokrovskoe, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sister Kitty Levin's.
<p/>The house on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own estate was quite in ruins, and Levin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife had persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to spend the summer with them.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch greatly approved of the arrangement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was very sorry his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) official duties prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) from spending the summer in the country with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) family, which would have been the greatest happiness for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>); and remaining in Moscow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) came down to the country from time to time for a day or two.
<p/>Besides the Oblonskys, with all their children and their governess, the old princess too came to stay that summer with the Levins, as she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) considered it her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) duty to watch over her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) inexperienced daughter in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)  interesting condition .
<p/>Moreover, Varenka, Kitty's friend abroad, kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) promise to come to Kitty when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was married, and stayed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) friend.
<p/>All of these were friends or relations of Levin's wife.
<p/>And though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) liked them all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) rather regretted his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own Levin world and ways, which was smothered by this influx of the <div class="bookquote">``Shtcherbatsky element,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) called it to himself.
<p/>Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own relations there stayed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) only Sergey Ivanovitch, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) too was a man of the Koznishev and not the Levin stamp, so that the Levin spirit was utterly obliterated.
<p/>In the Levins' house, so long deserted, there were now so many people that almost all the rooms were occupied, and almost every day it happened that the old princess, sitting down to table, counted them all over, and put the thirteenth grandson or granddaughter at a separate table.
<p/>And Kitty, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) careful housekeeping, had no little trouble to get all the chickens, turkeys, and geese, of which so many were needed to satisfy the summer appetites of the visitors and children.
<p/>The whole family were sitting at dinner.
<p/>Dolly's children, with their governess and Varenka, were making plans for going to look for mushrooms.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch, who was looked up to by all the party for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) intellect and learning, with a respect that almost amounted to awe, surprised everyone by joining in the conversation about mushrooms.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take me with you.
<p/>I am very fond of picking mushrooms,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) said, looking at Varenka; <div class="bookquote">``I think it's a very nice occupation.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Varenka</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we shall be delighted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>answered Varenka, coloring a little.
<p/>Kitty exchanged meaningful glances with Dolly.
<p/>The proposal of the learned and intellectual Sergey Ivanovitch to go looking for mushrooms with Varenka confirmed certain theories of Kitty's with which her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mind had been very busy of late.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) made haste to address some remark to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) look should not be noticed.
<p/>After dinner Sergey Ivanovitch sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) cup of coffee at the drawing-room window, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) took part in a conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had begun with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) watched the door through which the children would start on the mushroom-picking expedition.
<p/>Levin was sitting in the window near his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother.
<p/>Kitty stood beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband, evidently awaiting the end of a conversation that had no interest for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), in order to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) something.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have changed in many respects since your marriage, and for the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling to Kitty, and obviously little interested in the conversation, <div class="bookquote">``but you have remained true to your passion for defending the most paradoxical theories.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Katya, it's not good for you to stand,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) husband said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>), putting a chair for her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) and looking significantly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, and there's no time either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>added Sergey Ivanovitch, seeing the children running out.
<p/>At the head of them all Tanya galloped sideways, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) tightly- drawn stockings, and waving a basket and Sergey Ivanovitch's hat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) ran straight up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Boldly running up to Sergey Ivanovitch with shining eyes, so like her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) father's fine eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) hat and made as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) would put it on for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), softening her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) freedom by a shy and friendly smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Varenka's waiting,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) said, carefully putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) hat on, seeing from Sergey Ivanovitch's smile that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) might do so.
<p/>Varenka was standing at the door, dressed in a yellow print gown, with a white kerchief on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm coming, I'm coming, Varvara Andreevna,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) cup of coffee, and putting into their separate pockets his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) handkerchief and cigar-case.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how sweet my Varenka is!
<p/>eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Kitty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband, as soon as Sergey Ivanovitch rose.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) spoke so that Sergey Ivanovitch could hear, and it was clear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) meant him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) to do so.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how good-looking she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) is--such a refined beauty!
<p/>Varenka!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty shouted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you be in the mill copse?
<p/>We'll come out to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You certainly forget your condition, Kitty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the old princess, hurriedly coming out at the door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't shout like that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Varenka, hearing Kitty's voice and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother's reprimand, went with light, rapid steps up to Kitty.
<p/>The rapidity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) movement, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) flushed and eager face, everything betrayed that something out of the common was going on in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>Kitty knew what this was, and had been watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) intently.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) called Varenka at that moment merely in order mentally to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) a blessing for the important event which, as Kitty fancied, was bound to come to pass that day after dinner in the wood.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Varenka, I should be very happy if a certain something were to happen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) whispered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And are you coming with us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Varenka said to Levin in confusion, pretending not to have heard what had been said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am coming, but only as far as the threshing-floor, and there I shall stop.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what do you want there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go to have a look at the new wagons, and to check the invoice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin; <div class="bookquote">``and where will you be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the terrace.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 2   On the terrace were assembled all the ladies of the party.
<p/>They always liked sitting there after dinner, and that day they had work to do there too.
<p/>Besides the sewing and knitting of baby clothes, with which all of them were busy, that afternoon jam was being made on the terrace by a method new to Agafea Mihalovna, without the addition of water.
<p/>Kitty had introduced this new method, which had been in use in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) home.
<p/>Agafea Mihalovna, to whom the task of jam-making had always been intrusted, considering that what had been done in the Levin household could not be amiss, had nevertheless put water with the strawberries, maintaining that the jam could not be made without it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had been caught in the act, and was now making jam before everyone, and it was to be proved to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) conclusively that jam could be very well made without water.
<p/>Agafea Mihalovna, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face heated and angry, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hair untidy, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) thin arms bare to the elbows, was turning the preserving-pan over the charcoal stove, looking darkly at the raspberries and devoutly hoping they would stick and not cook properly.
<p/>The princess, conscious that Agafea Mihalovna's wrath must be chiefly directed against her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), as the person responsible for the raspberry jam-making, tried to appear to be absorbed in other things and not interested in the jam, talked of other matters, but cast stealthy glances in the direction of the stove.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always buy my maids' dresses myself, of some cheap material,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>the princess said, continuing the previous conversation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it time to skim it, my dear?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) added, addressing Agafea Mihalovna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's not the slightest need for you to do it, and it's hot for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) said, stopping Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, and getting up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) carefully passed the spoon over the frothing sugar, and from time to time shook off the clinging jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate that was covered with yellow-red scum and blood-colored syrup.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How they'll enjoy this at tea-time!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) children, remembering how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) herself as a child had wondered how it was the grown-up people did not eat what was best of all--the scum of the jam.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stiva says it's much better to give money.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly took up meanwhile the weighty subject under discussion, what presents should be made to servants.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But...''   (<font color='red'><b>the princess Kitty</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Money's out of the question!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess Kitty</b></font>)</div><p/>the princess and Kitty exclaimed with one voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They appreciate a present...''   (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, last year, for instance, I bought our Matrona Semyenovna, not a poplin, but something of that sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was wearing it on your nameday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A charming pattern--so simple and refined,--I should have liked it myself, if she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) hadn't had it.
<p/>Something like Varenka's.
<p/>So pretty and inexpensive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now I think it's done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, dropping the syrup from the spoon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When it sets as it drops, it's ready.
<p/>Cook it a little longer, Agafea Mihalovna.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The flies!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Agafea Mihalovna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Agafea Mihalovna angrily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll be just the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) added.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>how sweet it is!
<p/>don't frighten it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty said suddenly, looking at a sparrow that had settled on the step and was pecking at the center of a raspberry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but you keep a little further from the stove,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother.  ''
<p/>√Ä propos de Varenka ,'' said Kitty, speaking in French, as they had been doing all the while, so that Agafea Mihalovna should not understand them, <div class="bookquote">``you know, mamma, I somehow expect things to be settled today.
<p/>You know what I mean.
<p/>How splendid it would be!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Agafea Mihalovna</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what a famous matchmaker she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dolly.

 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Kitty, crooking one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) fingers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) thinks her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) very attractive, that's certain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>assented Dolly.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) would certainly be restful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>Dolly assented.

<p/>I shall see at once by their eyes.
<p/>I should be so delighted!
<p/>What do you think, Dolly?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't excite yourself.
<p/>It's not at all the thing for you to be excited,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) mother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm not excited, mamma.
<p/>I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) will make her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) an offer today.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's so strange, how and when a man makes an offer!...
<p/>There is a sort of barrier, and all at once it's broken down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, smiling pensively and recalling her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) past with Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, how did papa make you an offer?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty asked suddenly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was nothing out of the way, it was very simple,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>answered the princess, but her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) face beamed all over at the recollection.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but how was it?
<p/>You loved him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), anyway, before you were allowed to speak?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty felt a peculiar pleasure in being able now to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother on equal terms about those questions of such paramount interest in a woman's life.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I did; he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had come to stay with us in the country.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how was it settled between you, mamma?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You imagine, I dare say, that you invented something quite new?
<p/>It's always just the same: it was settled by the eyes, by smiles...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How nicely you said that, mamma!
<p/>It's just by the eyes, by smiles that it's done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>Dolly assented.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what words did he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did Kostya say to you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) wrote it in chalk.
<p/>It was wonderful....  How long ago it seems!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said.
<p/>And the three women all fell to musing on the same thing.
<p/>Kitty was the first to break the silence.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) remembered all that last winter before her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) marriage, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) passion for Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's one thing ...that old love affair of Varenka's,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, a natural chain of ideas bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to this point.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have liked to say something to Sergey Ivanovitch, to prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>They're all--all men, I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``awfully jealous over our past.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You judge by your own husband.
<p/>It makes him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) miserable even now to remember Vronsky.
<p/>Eh?
<p/>that's true, isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>Kitty answered, a pensive smile in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I really don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>the mother put in in defense of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) motherly care of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter, <div class="bookquote">``what there was in your past that could worry him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)?
<p/>That Vronsky paid you attentions--that happens to every girl.''
 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, but we didn't mean that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>Kitty said, flushing a little.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, let me speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother went on, <div class="bookquote">``why, you yourself would not let me have a talk to Vronsky.
<p/>Don't you remember?''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mamma!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Kitty, with an expression of suffering.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no keeping you young people in check nowadays....
<p/>Your friendship could not have gone beyond what was suitable.
<p/>I should myself have called upon him (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) to explain himself.
<p/>But, my darling, it's not right for you to be agitated.
<p/>Please remember that, and calm yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm perfectly calm, maman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How happy it was for Kitty that Anna came then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, <div class="bookquote">``and how unhappy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/>It turned out quite the opposite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said, struck by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) own ideas.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then Anna was so happy, and Kitty thought herself unhappy.
<p/>Now it is just the opposite.
<p/>I often think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A nice person to think about!
<p/>Horrid, repulsive woman--no heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother Levin</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother, who could not forget that Kitty had married not Vronsky, but Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want to talk of it for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty said with annoyance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never think about it, and I don't want to think of it.... And I don't want to think of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, catching the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband's well-known step on the steps of the terrace.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that you don't want to think about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>inquired Levin, coming onto the terrace.
<p/>But no one answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not repeat the question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry I've broken in on your feminine parliament,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, looking round on every one discontentedly, and perceiving that they had been talking of something which they would not talk about before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>For a second he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was sharing the feeling of Agafea Mihalovna, vexation at their making jam without water, and altogether at the outside Shtcherbatsky element.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) smiled, however, and went up to Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) with the expression with which everyone looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) now.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``and how have things gone with you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The wagons held three times as much as the old carts did.
<p/>Well, are we going for the children?
<p/>I've ordered the horses to be put in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!
<p/>you want to take Kitty in the wagonette?''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother said reproachfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, at a walking pace, princess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin never called the princess <div class="bookquote">``maman''  (<font color='red'><b>princess</b></font>)</div>as men often do call their mothers-in-law, and the princess disliked his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) not doing so.
<p/>But though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) liked and respected the princess, Levin could not call her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) so without a sense of profaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) feeling for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dead mother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come with us, maman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like to see such imprudence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll walk then, I'm so well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty got up and went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband and took his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may be well, but everything in moderation,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Agafea Mihalovna, is the jam done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, smiling to Agafea Mihalovna, and trying to cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it all right in the new way?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it's all right.
<p/>For our notions it's boiled too long.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll be all the better, Agafea Mihalovna, it won't mildew, even though our ice has begun to thaw already, so that we've no cool cellar to store it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, at once divining her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband's motive, and addressing the old housekeeper with the same feeling; <div class="bookquote">``but your pickle's so good, that mamma says she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) never tasted any like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) added, smiling, and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) kerchief straight.
<p/>Agafea Mihalovna looked angrily at Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't try to console me, mistress.
<p/>I need only to look at you with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and I feel happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, and something in the rough familiarity of that  with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)  touched Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along with us to look for mushrooms, you will show us the best places.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Agafea Mihalovna</b></font>)</div><p/>Agafea Mihalovna smiled and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) head, as though to say: <div class="bookquote">``I should like to be angry with you too, but I can't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Agafea Mihalovna</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do it, please, by my receipt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess; <div class="bookquote">``put some paper over the jam, and moisten it with a little rum, and without even ice, it will never go mildewy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 3    Kitty was particularly glad of a chance of being alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had noticed the shade of mortification that had passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face--always so quick to reflect every feeling--at the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had come onto the terrace and asked what they were talking of, and had got no answer.
<p/>When they had set off on foot ahead of the others, and had come out of sight of the house onto the beaten dusty road, marked with rusty wheels and sprinkled with grains of corn, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) clung faster to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arm and pressed it closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had quite forgotten the momentary unpleasant impression, and alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt, now that the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) approaching motherhood was never for a moment absent from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mind, a new and delicious bliss, quite pure from all alloy of sense, in the being near to the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) loved.
<p/>There was no need of speech, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) longed to hear the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice, which like her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes had changed since she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been with child.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice, as in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes, there was that softness and gravity which is found in people continually concentrated on some cherished pursuit.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you're not tired?
<p/>Lean more on me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm so glad of a chance of being alone with you, and I must own, though I'm happy with them, I do regret our winter evenings alone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was good, but this is even better.
<p/>Both are better,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, squeezing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what we were talking about when you came in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About jam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, listening more to the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice than to the words she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was saying, and all the while paying attention to the road, which passed now through the forest, and avoiding places where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might make a false step.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And about Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka.
<p/>You've noticed?...
<p/>I'm very anxious for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think about it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) peeped into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) can't fall in love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin said, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) has not the weakness necessary....

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty asked, with an ironical and loving smile.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could never have explained the chain of thought that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) smile; but the last link in it was that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband, in exalting his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) brother and abasing himself, was not quite sincere.
<p/>Kitty knew that this insincerity came from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) love for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) brother, from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sense of shame at being too happy, and above all from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) unflagging craving to be better--she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) loved it in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) smiled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you?
<p/>What are you dissatisfied with?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) asked, with the same smile.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) disbelief in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) self-dissatisfaction delighted him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and unconsciously he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tried to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) into giving utterance to the grounds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) disbelief.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am happy, but dissatisfied with myself...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cried, breaking off to scold her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) for too agile a movement in stepping over a branch that lay in the path.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so, and I don't think so.

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) stooped down and picked a wild camomile at the edge of the path.

 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty, snatching at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand, stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had been watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fingers with interest.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You picked off two.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but see, this little one shan't count to make up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, tearing off a little half-grown petal.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you tired, Kitty?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>called the princess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are you can get in, as the horses are quiet and walking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But it was not worth while to get in, they were quite near the place, and all walked on together.
<p/>Chapter 4  Varenka, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) white kerchief on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) black hair, surrounded by the children, gaily and good-humoredly looking after them, and at the same time visibly excited at the possibility of receiving a declaration from the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) cared for, was very attractive.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch walked beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and never left off admiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>Looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) recalled all the delightful things he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) lips, all the good he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) knew about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and became more and more conscious that the feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was something special that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had felt long, long ago, and only once, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) early youth.
<p/>The feeling of happiness in being near her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) continually grew, and at last reached such a point that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) put a huge, slender-stalked agaric fungus in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) basket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) looked straight into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face, and noticing the flush of glad and alarmed excitement that overspread her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was confused himself, and smiled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) in silence a smile that said too much.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``I ought to think it over and make up my mind, and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to pick by myself apart from all the rest, or else my efforts will make no show,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left the edge of the forest where they were walking on low silky grass between old birch trees standing far apart, and went more into the heart of the wood, where between the white birch trunks there were gray trunks of aspen and dark bushes of hazel.
<p/>Walking some forty paces away, Sergey Ivanovitch, knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was out of sight, stood still behind a bushy spindle-tree in full flower with its rosy red catkins.
<p/>It was perfectly still all round him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Only overhead in the birches under which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) stood, the flies, like a swarm of bees, buzzed unceasingly, and from time to time the children's voices were floated across to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>All at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) heard, not far from the edge of the wood, the sound of Varenka's contralto voice, calling Grisha, and a smile of delight passed over Sergey Ivanovitch's face.
<p/>Conscious of this smile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) head disapprovingly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) own condition, and taking out a cigar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) began lighting it.
<p/>For a long while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) could not get a match to light against the trunk of a birch tree.
<p/>The soft scales of the white bark rubbed off the phosphorus, and the light went out.
<p/>At last one of the matches burned, and the fragrant cigar smoke, hovering uncertainly in flat, wide coils, stretched away forwards and upwards over a bush under the overhanging branches of a birch tree.
<p/>Watching the streak of smoke, Sergey Ivanovitch walked gently on, deliberating on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) position.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it were only a passing fancy or a passion, if it were only this attraction--this mutual attraction -LRB-I can call it a  mutual  attraction-RRB-, but if I felt that it was in contradiction with the whole bent of my life--if I felt that in giving way to this attraction I should be false to my vocation and my duty...but it's not so.
<p/>The only thing I can say against it is that, when I lost Marie, I said to myself that I would remain faithful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) memory.
<p/>That's the only thing I can say against my feeling....  That's a great thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>Sergey Ivanovitch said to himself, feeling at the same time that this consideration had not the slightest importance for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) personally, but would only perhaps detract from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) romantic character in the eyes of others.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But apart from that, however much I searched, I should never find anything to say against my feeling.
<p/>If I were choosing by considerations of suitability alone, I could not have found anything better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>women girls</b></font>)</div><p/>However many women and girls he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) thought of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) could not think of a girl who united to such a degree all, positively all, the qualities he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) would wish to see in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) wife.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had all the charm and freshness of youth, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not a child; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) consciously as a woman ought to love; that was one thing.
<p/>Another point: she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not only far from being worldly, but had an unmistakable distaste for worldly society, and at the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew the world, and had all the ways of a woman of the best society, which were absolutely essential to Sergey Ivanovitch's conception of the woman who was to share his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) life.
<p/>Thirdly: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was religious, and not like a child, unconsciously religious and good, as Kitty, for example, was, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) life was founded on religious principles.
<p/>Even in trifling matters, Sergey Ivanovitch found in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) wanted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) wife: she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was poor and alone in the world, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) would not bring with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) a mass of relations and their influence into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband's house, as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw now in Kitty's case.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) would owe everything to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband, which was what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had always desired too for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) future family life.
<p/>And this girl, who united all these qualities, loved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a modest man, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not help seeing it.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>There was one consideration against it--his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) age.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) came of a long-lived family, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had not a single gray hair, no one would have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for forty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) remembered Varenka's saying that it was only in Russia that men of fifty thought themselves old, and that in France a man of fifty considers himself  dans la force de l'√¢ge , while a man of forty is  un jeune homme .
<p/>But what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt as young in heart as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been twenty years ago?
<p/>Was it not youth to feel as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt now, when coming from the other side to the edge of the wood he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw in the glowing light of the slanting sunbeams the gracious figure of Varenka in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yellow gown with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) basket, walking lightly by the trunk of an old birch tree, and when this impression of the sight of Varenka blended so harmoniously with the beauty of the view, of the yellow oatfield lying bathed in the slanting sunshine, and beyond it the distant ancient forest flecked with yellow and melting into the blue of the distance?
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart throbbed joyously.
<p/>A softened feeling came over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind.
<p/>Varenka, who had just crouched down to pick a mushroom, rose with a supple movement and looked round.
<p/>Flinging away the cigar, Sergey Ivanovitch advanced with resolute steps towards her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 5   <div class="bookquote">``Varvara Andreevna, when I was very young, I set before myself the ideal of the woman I loved and should be happy to call my wife.

<p/>Seeing Sergey Ivanovitch approaching, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not get up and did not change her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) position, but everything told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) presence and was glad of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, did you find some?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked from under the white kerchief, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) handsome, gently smiling face to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not answer, busy with the children who thronged about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That one too, near the twig,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pointed out to little Masha a little fungus, split in half across its rosy cap by the dry grass from under which it thrust itself.
<p/>Varenka got up while Masha picked the fungus, breaking it into two white halves.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This brings back my childhood,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) added, moving apart from the children beside Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/>They walked on for some steps in silence.
<p/>Varenka saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) wanted to speak; she (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) guessed of what, and felt faint with joy and panic.
<p/>They had walked so far away that no one could hear them now, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) did not begin to speak.
<p/>It would have been better for Varenka to be silent.
<p/>After a silence it would have been easier for them to say what they wanted to say than after talking about mushrooms.
<p/>But against her (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) own will, as it were accidentally, Varenka said:  <div class="bookquote">``So you found nothing?
<p/>In the middle of the wood there are always fewer, though.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Sergey Ivanovitch sighed and made no answer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was annoyed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) had spoken about the mushrooms.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) wanted to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) back to the first words she (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) had uttered about her (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) childhood; but after a pause of some length, as though against his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) own will, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) made an observation in response to her (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) last words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard that the white edible funguses are found principally at the edge of the wood, though I can't tell them apart.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/>Some minutes more passed, they moved still further away from the children, and were quite alone.
<p/>Varenka's heart throbbed so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) heard it beating, and felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) was turning red and pale and red again.
<p/>To be the wife of a man like Koznishev, after her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) position with Madame Stahl, was to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) imagination the height of happiness.
<p/>Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was almost certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Stahl</b></font>).
<p/>And this moment it would have to be decided.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) felt frightened.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dreaded both his (<font color='blue'><b>Stahl</b></font>) speaking and his (<font color='blue'><b>Stahl</b></font>) not speaking.
<p/>Now or never it must be said--that Sergey Ivanovitch felt too.
<p/>Everything in the expression, the flushed cheeks and the downcast eyes of Varenka betrayed a painful suspense.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch saw it and felt sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) felt even that to say nothing now would be a slight to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>Rapidly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) own mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) ran over all the arguments in support of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) decision.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) even said over to himself the words in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) meant to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) offer, but instead of those words, some utterly unexpected reflection that occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) ask:  <div class="bookquote">``What is the difference between the `birch' mushroom and the `white' mushroom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Varenka's lips quivered with emotion as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answered:  <div class="bookquote">``In the top part there is scarcely any difference, it's in the stalk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And as soon as these words were uttered, both he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) felt that it was over, that what was to have been said would not be said; and their emotion, which had up to then been continually growing more intense, began to subside.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The birch mushroom's stalk suggests a dark man's chin after two days without shaving,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, speaking quite calmly now.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>answered Varenka smiling, and unconsciously the direction of their walk changed.
<p/>They began to turn towards the children.
<p/>Varenka felt both sore and ashamed; at the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had a sense of relief.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had got home again and went over the whole subject, Sergey Ivanovitch thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) previous decision had been a mistaken one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) could not be false to the memory of Marie.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gently, children, gently!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin shouted quite angrily to the children, standing before his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) when the crowd of children flew with shrieks of delight to meet them.
<p/>Behind the children Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka walked out of the wood.
<p/>Kitty had no need to ask Varenka; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) saw from the calm and somewhat crestfallen faces of both that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) plans had not come off.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) as they were going home again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't bite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) smile and manner of speaking recalling her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father, a likeness Levin often noticed with pleasure.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How doesn't bite?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll show you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband's hand, lifting it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mouth, and just faintly brushing it with closed lips.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like a kiss on a priest's hand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which didn't it bite with?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) said, laughing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Both.
<p/>But it should have been like this...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There are some peasants coming...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, they didn't see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 6   During the time of the children's tea the grown-up people sat in the balcony and talked as though nothing had happened, though they all, especially Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka, were very well aware that there had happened an event which, though negative, was of very great importance.
<p/>They both had the same feeling, rather like that of a schoolboy after an examination, which has left him (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) in the same class or shut him (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) out of the school forever.
<p/>Everyone present, feeling too that something had happened, talked eagerly about extraneous subjects.
<p/>Levin and Kitty were particularly happy and conscious of their love that evening.
<p/>And their happiness in their love seemed to imply a disagreeable slur on those who would have liked to feel the same and could not--and they felt a prick of conscience.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mark my words, Alexander will not come,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the old princess.
<p/>That evening they were expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch to come down by train, and the old prince had written that possibly he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) might come too.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I know why,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>the princess went on; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) says that young people ought to be left alone for a while at first.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But papa has left us alone.
<p/>We've never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides, we're not young people!--we're old, married people by now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) doesn't come, I shall say good-bye to you children,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess, sighing mournfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense, mamma!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the daughters</b></font>)</div><p/>both the daughters fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) at once.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is feeling?
<p/>Why, now...''   (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>And suddenly there was an unexpected quiver in the princess's voice.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) daughters were silent, and looked at one another.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maman always finds something to be miserable about,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they said in that glance.
<p/>They did not know that happy as the princess was in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) daughter's house, and useful as she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) felt herself to be there, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had been extremely miserable, both on her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) own account and her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) husband's, ever since they had married their last and favorite daughter, and the old home had been left empty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, Agafea Mihalovna?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty asked suddenly of Agafea Mihalovna, who was standing with a mysterious air, and a face full of meaning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``About supper.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly; <div class="bookquote">``you go and arrange about it, and I'll go and hear Grisha repeat his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lesson, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will have nothing done all day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's my lesson!
<p/>No, Dolly, I'm going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, jumping up.
<p/>Grisha, who was by now at a high school, had to go over the lessons of the term in the summer holidays.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna, who had been studying Latin with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) son in Moscow before, had made it a rule on coming to the Levins' to go over with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), at least once a day, the most difficult lessons of Latin and arithmetic.
<p/>Levin had offered to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) place, but the mother, having once overheard Levin's lesson, and noticing that it was not given exactly as the teacher in Moscow had given it, said resolutely, though with much embarrassment and anxiety not to mortify Levin, that they must keep strictly to the book as the teacher had done, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had better undertake it again herself.
<p/>Levin was amazed both at Stepan Arkadyevitch, who, by neglecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) duty, threw upon the mother the supervision of studies of which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had no comprehension, and at the teachers for teaching the children so badly.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) promised his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sister-in-law to give the lessons exactly as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) wished.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went on teaching Grisha, not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own way, but by the book, and so took little interest in it, and often forgot the hour of the lesson.
<p/>So it had been today.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm going, Dolly, you sit still,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll do it all properly, like the book.
<p/>Only when Stiva comes, and we go out shooting, then we shall have to miss it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>And Levin went to Grisha.
<p/>Varenka was saying the same thing to Kitty.
<p/>Even in the happy, well-ordered household of the Levins Varenka had succeeded in making herself useful.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll see to the supper, you sit still,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, and got up to go to Agafea Mihalovna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, most likely they've not been able to get chickens.
<p/>If so, ours...''   (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Agafea Mihalovna and I will see about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Varenka/Mademoiselle Varenka/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>and Varenka vanished with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a nice girl!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>said the princess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not nice, maman; she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)'s an exquisite girl; there's no one else like her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you are expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch today?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>said Sergey Ivanovitch, evidently not disposed to pursue the conversation about Varenka.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be difficult to find two sons-in-law more unlike than yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) said with a subtle smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One all movement, only living in society, like a fish in water; the other our Kostya, lively, alert, quick in everything, but as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) is in society, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) either sinks into apathy, or struggles helplessly like a fish on land.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>)'s very heedless,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess, addressing Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been meaning, indeed, to ask you to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) that it's out of the question for her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) indicated Kitty-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``to stay here; that she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) positively must come to Moscow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) talks of getting a doctor down...''   (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>)'ll do everything; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) has agreed to everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>Kitty said, angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother for appealing to Sergey Ivanovitch to judge in such a matter.
<p/>In the middle of their conversation they heard the snorting of horses and the sound of wheels on the gravel.
<p/>Dolly had not time to get up to go and meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) husband, when from the window of the room below, where Grisha was having his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lesson, Levin leaped out and helped Grisha out after him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Stiva!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin shouted from under the balcony.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've finished, Dolly, don't be afraid!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) added, and started running like a boy to meet the carriage.  ''
<p/>Is ea id, ejus, ejus, ejus! ''
<p/>shouted Grisha, skipping along the avenue.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And some one else too!
<p/>Papa, of course!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Levin, stopping at the entrance of the avenue.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kitty, don't come down the steep staircase, go round.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>But Levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the carriage for the old prince.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) got nearer to the carriage he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw beside Stepan Arkadyevitch not the prince but a handsome, stout young man in a Scotch cap, with long ends of ribbon behind.
<p/>This was Vassenka Veslovsky, a distant cousin of the Shtcherbatskys, a brilliant young gentleman in Petersburg and Moscow society.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A capital fellow, and a keen sportsman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>as Stepan Arkadyevitch said, introducing him (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>).
<p/>Not a whit abashed by the disappointment caused by his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) having come in place of the old prince, Veslovsky greeted Levin gaily, claiming acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in the past, and snatching up Grisha into the carriage, lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) over the pointer that Stepan Arkadyevitch had brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Levin did not get into the carriage, but walked behind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was rather vexed at the non-arrival of the old prince, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) liked more and more the more he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) saw of him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>), and also at the arrival of this Vassenka Veslovsky, a quite uncongenial and superfluous person.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) still more uncongenial and superfluous when, on approaching the steps where the whole party, children and grown-up, were gathered together in much excitement, Levin saw Vassenka Veslovsky, with a particularly warm and gallant air, kissing Kitty's hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your wife and I are cousins and very old friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div>said Vassenka Veslovsky, once more shaking Levin's hand with great warmth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, are there plenty of birds?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch said to Levin, hardly leaving time for everyone to utter their greetings.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've come with the most savage intentions.
<p/>Why, maman, they've not been in Moscow since!
<p/>Look, Tanya, here's something for you!
<p/>Get it, please, it's in the carriage, behind!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) talked in all directions.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How pretty you've grown, Dolly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife, once more kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) hand, holding it in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and patting it with the other.
<p/>Levin, who a minute before had been in the happiest frame of mind, now looked darkly at everyone, and everything displeased him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was it he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) kissed yesterday with those lips?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought, looking at Stepan Arkadyevitch's tender demonstrations to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looked at Dolly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) either.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) doesn't believe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) love.
<p/>So what is she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) so pleased about?
<p/>Revolting!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Levin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looked at the princess, who had been so dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) a minute before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not like the manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) welcomed this Vassenka, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ribbons, just as though she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) were in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) own house.
<p/>Even Sergey Ivanovitch, who had come out too onto the steps, seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) unpleasant with the show of cordiality with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) met Stepan Arkadyevitch, though Levin knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother neither liked nor respected Oblonsky.
<p/>And Varenka, even she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) seemed hateful, with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) air  sainte nitouche  making the acquaintance of this gentleman, while all the while she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was thinking of nothing but getting married.
<p/>And more hateful than anyone was Kitty for falling in with the tone of gaiety with which this gentleman regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) visit in the country, as though it were a holiday for himself and everyone else.
<p/>And, above all, unpleasant was that particular smile with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) responded to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) smile.
<p/>Noisily talking, they all went into the house; but as soon as they were all seated, Levin turned and went out.
<p/>Kitty saw something was wrong with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) tried to seize a moment to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) alone, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) made haste to get away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was wanted at the counting-house.
<p/>It was long since his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own work on the estate had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) so important as at that moment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all holiday for them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``but these are no holiday matters, they won't wait, and there's no living without them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 7   Levin came back to the house only when they sent to summon him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to supper.
<p/>On the stairs were standing Kitty and Agafea Mihalovna, consulting about wines for supper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why are you making all this fuss?
<p/>Have what we usually do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Stiva doesn't drink...Kostya, stop, what's the matter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty began, hurrying after him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) strode ruthlessly away to the dining room without waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and at once joined in the lively general conversation which was being maintained there by Vassenka Veslovsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what do you say, are we going shooting tomorrow?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, do let's go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div>said Veslovsky, moving to another chair, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) sat down sideways, with one fat leg crossed under him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin to Veslovsky, looking intently at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) leg, but speaking with that forced amiability that Kitty knew so well in him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and that was so out of keeping with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div><p/>Vassenka crossed over to the ladies, and sat down beside Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, do tell me, please; you have stayed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)?
<p/>How was she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>Darya Alexandrovna appealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>Levin was left at the other end of the table, and though never pausing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) conversation with the princess and Varenka, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw that there was an eager and mysterious conversation going on between Stepan Arkadyevitch, Dolly, Kitty, and Veslovsky.
<p/>And that was not all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife's face an expression of real feeling as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gazed with fixed eyes on the handsome face of Vassenka, who was telling them something with great animation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's exceedingly nice at their place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div>Veslovsky was telling them about Vronsky and Anna.

<p/>And it will be better indeed without you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you, Kitty?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I?
<p/>Why should I go?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty said, flushing all over, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) glanced round at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know Anna Arkadyevna, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div><p/>Veslovsky asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)'s a very fascinating woman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) answered Veslovsky, crimsoning still more.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) got up and walked across to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going shooting, then, tomorrow?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) jealousy had in these few moments, especially at the flush that had overspread her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) cheeks while she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was talking to Veslovsky, gone far indeed.
<p/>Now as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) words, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) construed them in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own fashion.
<p/>Strange as it was to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) afterwards to recall it, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) at the moment clear that in asking whether he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was going shooting, all she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) cared to know was whether he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would give that pleasure to Vassenka Veslovsky, with whom, as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fancied, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was in love.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'm going,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) in an unnatural voice, disagreeable to himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, better spend the day here tomorrow, or Dolly won't see anything of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) husband, and set off the day after,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty.
<p/>The motive of Kitty's words was interpreted by Levin thus: <div class="bookquote">``Don't separate me from  him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) .
<p/>I don't care about  your  going, but do let me enjoy the society of this delightful young man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you wish, we'll stay here tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin answered, with peculiar amiability.
<p/>Vassenka meanwhile, utterly unsuspecting the misery his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) presence had occasioned, got up from the table after Kitty, and watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) with smiling and admiring eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>Levin saw that look.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) turned white, and for a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could hardly breathe.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How dare he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) look at my wife like that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>was the feeling that boiled within him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tomorrow, then?
<p/>Do, please, let us go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div>said Vassenka, sitting down on a chair, and again crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) leg as his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) habit was.
<p/>Levin's jealousy went further still.
<p/>Already he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw himself a deceived husband, looked upon by his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lover as simply necessary to provide them with the conveniences and pleasures of life....
<p/>But in spite of that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) made polite and hospitable inquiries of Vassenka about his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shooting, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) boots, and agreed to go shooting next day.
<p/>Happily for Levin, the old princess cut short his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) agonies by getting up herself and advising Kitty to go to bed.
<p/>But even at this point Levin could not escape another agony.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said good-night to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hostess, Vassenka would again have kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) hand, but Kitty, reddening, drew back her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hand and said with a na√Øve bluntness, for which the old princess scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) afterwards:  <div class="bookquote">``We don't like that fashion.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>In Levin's eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was to blame for having allowed such relations to arise, and still more to blame for showing so awkwardly that she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) did not like them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, how can one want to go to bed!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who, after drinking several glasses of wine at supper, was now in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) most charming and sentimental humor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, Kitty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, pointing to the moon, which had just risen behind the lime trees --<div class="bookquote">``how exquisite!
<p/>Veslovsky, this is the time for a serenade.
<p/>You know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) has a splendid voice; we practiced songs together along the road.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) has brought some lovely songs with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), two new ones.
<p/>Varvara Andreevna and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must sing some duets.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When the party had broken up, Stepan Arkadyevitch walked a long while about the avenue with Veslovsky; their voices could be heard singing one of the new songs.
<p/>Levin hearing these voices sat scowling in an easy-chair in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife's bedroom, and maintained an obstinate silence when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) what was wrong.
<p/>But when at last with a timid glance she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hazarded the question: <div class="bookquote">``Was there perhaps something you disliked about Veslovsky?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>--it all burst out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was humiliated himself at what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was saying, and that exasperated him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) all the more.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stood facing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes glittering menacingly under his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scowling brows, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) strong arms across his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) chest, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) were straining every nerve to hold himself in.
<p/>The expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face would have been grim, and even cruel, if it had not at the same time had a look of suffering which touched her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) jaws were twitching, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) voice kept breaking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must understand that I'm not jealous, that's a nasty word.
<p/>I can't be jealous, and believe that....
<p/>I can't say what I feel, but this is awful....
<p/>I'm not jealous, but I'm wounded, humiliated that anybody  dare think, that anybody dare look at you with eyes like that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eyes like what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Kitty, trying as conscientiously as possible to recall every word and gesture of that evening and every shade implied in them.
<p/>At the very bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did think there had been something precisely at the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had crossed over after her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to the other end of the table; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) dared not own it even to herself, and would have been even more unable to bring herself to say so to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and so increase his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) suffering.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what can there possibly be attractive about me as I am now?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cried, clutching at his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``you shouldn't say that!...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what can you be thinking about!
<p/>When for me there's no one in the world, no one, no one!...
<p/>Would you like me never to see anyone?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For the first minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had been offended at his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) jealousy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was angry that the slightest amusement, even the most innocent, should be forbidden her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>); but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) would readily have sacrificed, not merely such trifles, but everything, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) peace of mind, to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) from the agony he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) was suffering.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must understand the horror and comedy of my position,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) went on in a desperate whisper; <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>)'s in my house, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>)'s done nothing improper positively except his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) free and easy airs and the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) sits on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) legs.

<p/>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was breathless with emotion.
<p/>Levin was silent for a space, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scanned her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) pale and distressed face, and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) clutched at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Katya, I've been worrying you!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall see.
<p/>Tomorrow....  Oh, yes, we are going tomorrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 8   Next day, before the ladies were up, the wagonette and a trap for the shooting party were at the door, and Laska, aware since early morning that they were going shooting, after much whining and darting to and fro, had sat herself down in the wagonette beside the coachman, and, disapproving of the delay, was excitedly watching the door from which the sportsmen still did not come out.
<p/>The first to come out was Vassenka Veslovsky, in new high boots that reached half-way up his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) thick thighs, in a green blouse, with a new Russian leather cartridge-belt, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) Scotch cap with ribbons, with a brand-new English gun without a sling.
<p/>Laska flew up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>), welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>), and jumping up, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) own way whether the others were coming soon, but getting no answer from him (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) post of observation and sank into repose again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) head on one side, and one ear pricked up to listen.
<p/>At last the door opened with a creak, and Stepan Arkadyevitch's spot-and-tan pointer Krak flew out, running round and round and turning over in the air.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch himself followed with a gun in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) hand and a cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) mouth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good dog, good dog, Krak!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) cried encouragingly to the dog, who put his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) paws up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) chest, catching at his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) game bag.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch was dressed in rough leggings and spats, in torn trousers and a short coat.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) head there was a wreck of a hat of indefinite form, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) gun of a new patent was a perfect gem, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) game bag and cartridge belt, though worn, were of the very best quality.
<p/>Vassenka Veslovsky had had no notion before that it was truly chic  for a sportsman to be in tatters, but to have his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) shooting outfit of the best quality.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) saw it now as he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) looked at Stepan Arkadyevitch, radiant in his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) rags, graceful, well-fed, and joyous, a typical Russian nobleman.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) mind that next time he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) went shooting he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) would certainly adopt the same get-up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and what about our host?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A young wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and such a charming one!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) came down dressed.
<p/>No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>)'s run up to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch guessed right.
<p/>Levin had run up again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) once more if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) idiocy yesterday, and, moreover, to beg her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for Christ's sake to be more careful.
<p/>The great thing was for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to keep away from the children--they might any minute push against her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had once more to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) declare that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) for going away for two days, and to beg her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to be sure to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) a note next morning by a servant on horseback, to write him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), if it were but two words only, to let him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) know that all was well with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>Kitty was distressed, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) always was, at parting for a couple of days from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eager figure, looking big and strong in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shooting-boots and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) white blouse, and a sort of sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own chagrin for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pleasure, and said good-bye to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cheerfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon, gentlemen!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, running out onto the steps.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you put the lunch in?

 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin jumped out of the wagonette, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had already taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) seat, to meet the carpenter, who came towards the steps with a rule in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't come to the counting house yesterday, and now you're detaining me.
<p/>Well, what is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would your honor let me make another turning?
<p/>It's only three steps to add.
<p/>And we make it just fit at the same time.
<p/>It will be much more convenient.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have listened to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin answered with annoyance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I said: Put the lines and then fit in the steps.
<p/>Now there's no setting it right.
<p/>Do as I told you, and make a new staircase.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the carpenter</b></font>)</div><p/>The point was that in the lodge that was being built the carpenter had spoiled the staircase, fitting it together without calculating the space it was to fill, so that the steps were all sloping when it was put in place.
<p/>Now the carpenter wanted, keeping the same staircase, to add three steps.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be much better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But where's your staircase coming out with its three steps?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, upon my word, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the carpenter</b></font>)</div>the carpenter said with a contemptuous smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It comes out right at the very spot.
<p/>It starts, so to speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) said, with a persuasive gesture; <div class="bookquote">``it comes down, and comes down, and comes out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But three steps will add to the length too...where is it to come out?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, to be sure, it'll start from the bottom and go up and go up, and come out so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the carpenter</b></font>)</div>the carpenter said obstinately and convincingly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll reach the ceiling and the wall.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word!
<p/>Why, it'll go up, and up, and come out like this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin took out a ramrod and began sketching him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) the staircase in the dust.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, do you see?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As your honor likes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the carpenter</b></font>)</div>said the carpenter, with a sudden gleam in his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) eyes, obviously understanding the thing at last.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems it'll be best to make a new one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, do it as you're told,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin shouted, seating himself in the wagonette.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Down!
<p/>Hold the dogs, Philip!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin felt now at leaving behind all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) family and household cares such an eager sense of joy in life and expectation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not disposed to talk.
<p/>Besides that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had that feeling of concentrated excitement that every sportsman experiences as he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) approaches the scene of action.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) had anything on his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) mind at that moment, it was only the doubt whether they would start anything in the Kolpensky marsh, whether Laska would show to advantage in comparison with Krak, and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) would shoot well that day himself.
<p/>Not to disgrace himself before a new spectator--not to be outdone by Oblonsky--that too was a thought that crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) brain.
<p/>Oblonsky was feeling the same, and he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) too was not talkative.
<p/>Vassenka Veslovsky kept up alone a ceaseless flow of cheerful chatter.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) now, Levin felt ashamed to think how unfair he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) the day before.
<p/>Vassenka was really a nice fellow, simple, good-hearted, and very good-humored.
<p/>If Levin had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was married, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would have made friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Levin rather disliked his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) holiday attitude to life and a sort of free and easy assumption of elegance.
<p/>It was as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) assumed a high degree of importance in himself that could not be disputed, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had long nails and a stylish cap, and everything else to correspond; but this could be forgiven for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) good nature and good breeding.
<p/>Levin liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) good education, for speaking French and English with such an excellent accent, and for being a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) world.
<p/>Vassenka was extremely delighted with the left horse, a horse of the Don Steppes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) kept praising him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) enthusiastically.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How fine it must be galloping over the steppes on a steppe horse!
<p/>Eh?
<p/>isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) said.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) had imagined riding on a steppe horse as something wild and romantic, and it turned out nothing of the sort.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) simplicity, particularly in conjunction with his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) good looks, his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) amiable smile, and the grace of his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) movements, was very attractive.
<p/>Either because his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) nature was sympathetic to Levin, or because Levin was trying to atone for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sins of the previous evening by seeing nothing but what was good in him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), anyway he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) society.
<p/>After they had driven over two miles from home, Veslovsky all at once felt for a cigar and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pocketbook, and did not know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had lost them or left them on the table.
<p/>In the pocketbook there were thirty-seven pounds, and so the matter could not be left in uncertainty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what, Levin, I'll gallop home on that left trace-horse.
<p/>That will be splendid.
<p/>Eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, preparing to get out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, why should you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>answered Levin, calculating that Vassenka could hardly weigh less than seventeen stone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll send the coachman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The coachman</b></font>)</div><p/>The coachman rode back on the trace-horse, and Levin himself drove the remaining pair.
<p/>Chapter 9   <div class="bookquote">``Well, now what's our plan of campaign?
<p/>Tell us all about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our plan is this.
<p/>Now we're driving to Gvozdyov.
<p/>In Gvozdyov there's a grouse marsh on this side, and beyond Gvozdyov come some magnificent snipe marshes where there are grouse too.
<p/>It's hot now, and we'll get there--it's fifteen miles or so--towards evening and have some evening shooting; we'll spend the night there and go on tomorrow to the bigger moors.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is there nothing on the way?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but we'll reserve ourselves; besides it's hot.
<p/>There are two nice little places, but I doubt there being anything to shoot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin would himself have liked to go into these little places, but they were near home; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could shoot them over any time, and they were only little places--there would hardly be room for three to shoot.
<p/>And so, with some insincerity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) doubted there being anything to shoot.
<p/>When they reached a little marsh Levin would have driven by, but Stepan Arkadyevitch, with the experienced eye of a sportsman, at once detected reeds visible from the road.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shan't we try that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, pointing to the little marsh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Levin, do, please!
<p/>how delightful!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div><p/>Vassenka Veslovsky began begging, and Levin could but consent.
<p/>Before they had time to stop, the dogs had flown one before the other into the marsh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Krak!
<p/>Laska!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The dogs came back.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There won't be room for three.
<p/>I'll stay here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, hoping they would find nothing but peewits, who had been startled by the dogs, and turning over in their flight, were plaintively wailing over the marsh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!
<p/>Come along, Levin, let's go together!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div><p/>Veslovsky called.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, there's not room.
<p/>Laska, back, Laska!
<p/>You won't want another dog, will you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin remained with the wagonette, and looked enviously at the sportsmen.
<p/>They walked right across the marsh.
<p/>Except little birds and peewits, of which Vassenka killed one, there was nothing in the marsh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, you see now that it was not that I grudged the marsh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, <div class="bookquote">``only it's wasting time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, it was jolly all the same.
<p/>Did you see us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vassenka Veslovsky, clambering awkwardly into the wagonette with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) peewit in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How splendidly I shot this bird!
<p/>Didn't I?
<p/>Well, shall we soon be getting to the real place?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>The horses started off suddenly, Levin knocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head against the stock of someone's gun, and there was the report of a shot.
<p/>The gun did actually go off first, but that was how it seemed to Levin.
<p/>It appeared that Vassenka Veslovsky had pulled only one trigger, and had left the other hammer still cocked.
<p/>The charge flew into the ground without doing harm to anyone.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head and laughed reprovingly at Veslovsky.
<p/>But Levin had not the heart to reprove him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>In the first place, any reproach would have seemed to be called forth by the danger he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had incurred and the bump that had come up on Levin's forehead.
<p/>And besides, Veslovsky was at first so na√Øvely distressed, and then laughed so good-humoredly and infectiously at their general dismay, that one could not but laugh with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>When they reached the second marsh, which was fairly large, and would inevitably take some time to shoot over, Levin tried to persuade them to pass it by.
<p/>But Veslovsky again overpersuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Again, as the marsh was narrow, Levin, like a good host, remained with the carriage.
<p/>Krak made straight for some clumps of sedge.
<p/>Vassenka Veslovsky was the first to run after the dog.
<p/>Before Stepan Arkadyevitch had time to come up, a grouse flew out.
<p/>Veslovsky missed it and it flew into an unmown meadow.
<p/>This grouse was left for Veslovsky to follow up.
<p/>Krak found it again and pointed, and Veslovsky shot it and went back to the carriage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you go and I'll stay with the horses,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/>Levin had begun to feel the pangs of a sportsman's envy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) handed the reins to Veslovsky and walked into the marsh.
<p/>Laska, who had been plaintively whining and fretting against the injustice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) treatment, flew straight ahead to a hopeful place that Levin knew well, and that Krak had not yet come upon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) won't scare them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin, sympathizing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bitch's pleasure and hurrying after her (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>).
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) came nearer and nearer to the familiar breeding places there was more and more earnestness in Laska's exploration.
<p/>A little marsh bird did not divert her (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) attention for more than an instant.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) made one circuit round the clump of reeds, was beginning a second, and suddenly quivered with excitement and became motionless.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, Stiva!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>shouted Levin, feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart beginning to beat more violently; and all of a sudden, as though some sort of shutter had been drawn back from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) straining ears, all sounds, confused but loud, began to beat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hearing, losing all sense of distance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard the steps of Stepan Arkadyevitch, mistaking them for the tramp of the horses in the distance; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard the brittle sound of the twigs on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had trodden, taking this sound for the flying of a grouse.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard too, not far behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), a splashing in the water, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not explain to himself.
<p/>Picking his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) steps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) moved up to the dog.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fetch it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div><p/>Not a grouse but a snipe flew up from beside the dog.
<p/>Levin had lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun, but at the very instant when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was taking aim, the sound of splashing grew louder, came closer, and was joined with the sound of Veslovsky's voice, shouting something with strange loudness.
<p/>Levin saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun pointed behind the snipe, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fired.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had made sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had missed, Levin looked round and saw the horses and the wagonette not on the road but in the marsh.
<p/>Veslovsky, eager to see the shooting, had driven into the marsh, and got the horses stuck in the mud.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn the fellow!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin said to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went back to the carriage that had sunk in the mire.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you drive in for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dryly, and calling the coachman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began pulling the horses out.
<p/>Levin was vexed both at being hindered from shooting and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) horses getting stuck in the mud, and still more at the fact that neither Stepan Arkadyevitch nor Veslovsky helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and the coachman to unharness the horses and get them out, since neither of them had the slightest notion of harnessing.
<p/>Without vouchsafing a syllable in reply to Vassenka's protestations that it had been quite dry there, Levin worked in silence with the coachman at extricating the horses.
<p/>But then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) got warm at the work and saw how assiduously Veslovsky was tugging at the wagonette by one of the mud-guards, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) broke it indeed, Levin blamed himself for having under the influence of yesterday's feelings been too cold to Veslovsky, and tried to be particularly genial so as to smooth over his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) chilliness.
<p/>When everything had been put right, and the carriage had been brought back to the road, Levin had the lunch served.  ''
<p/>Bon app√©tit--bonne conscience!
<p/>Ce poulet va tomber jusqu'au fond de mes bottes ,'' Vassenka, who had recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) spirits, quoted the French saying as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) second chicken.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now our troubles are over, now everything's going to go well.
<p/>Only, to atone for my sins, I'm bound to sit on the box.
<p/>That's so?
<p/>eh?
<p/>No, no!
<p/>I'll be your Automedon.
<p/>You shall see how I'll get you along,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) answered, not letting go the rein, when Levin begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to let the coachman drive.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I must atone for my sins, and I'm very comfortable on the box.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drove.
<p/>Levin was a little afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would exhaust the horses, especially the chestnut, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not know how to hold in; but unconsciously he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fell under the influence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gaiety and listened to the songs he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sang all the way on the box, or the descriptions and representations he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gave of driving in the English fashion, four-in-hand; and it was in the very best of spirits that after lunch they drove to the Gvozdyov marsh.
<p/>Chapter 10   Vassenka drove the horses so smartly that they reached the marsh too early, while it was still hot.
<p/>As they drew near this more important marsh, the chief aim of their expedition, Levin could not help considering how he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could get rid of Vassenka and be free in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) movements.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch evidently had the same desire, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face Levin saw the look of anxiety always present in a true sportsman when beginning shooting, together with a certain good-humored slyness peculiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How shall we go?
<p/>It's a splendid marsh, I see, and there are hawks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pointing to two great birds hovering over the reeds.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where there are hawks, there is sure to be game.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, pulling up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) boots and examining the lock of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun with rather a gloomy expression, <div class="bookquote">``do you see those reeds?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge half-mown wet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The marsh begins here, straight in front of us, do you see--where it is greener?
<p/>From here it runs to the right where the horses are; there are breeding places there, and grouse, and all round those reeds as far as that alder, and right up to the mill.
<p/>Over there, do you see, where the pools are?
<p/>That's the best place.
<p/>There I once shot seventeen snipe.
<p/>We'll separate with the dogs and go in different directions, and then meet over there at the mill.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, which shall go to left and which to right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's wider to the right; you two go that way and I'll take the left,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said with apparent carelessness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Capital!
<p/>we'll make the bigger bag!
<p/>Yes, come along, come along!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div><p/>Vassenka exclaimed.
<p/>Levin could do nothing but agree, and they divided.
<p/>As soon as they entered the marsh, the two dogs began hunting about together and made towards the green, slime-covered pool.
<p/>Levin knew Laska's method, wary and indefinite; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew the place too and expected a whole covey of snipe.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Veslovsky, beside me, walk beside me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said in a faint voice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) companion splashing in the water behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Levin could not help feeling an interest in the direction his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun was pointed, after that casual shot near the Kolpensky marsh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I won't get in your way, don't trouble about me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>But Levin could not help troubling, and recalled Kitty's words at parting: <div class="bookquote">``Mind you don't shoot one another.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>The dogs came nearer and nearer, passed each other, each pursuing its own scent.
<p/>The expectation of snipe was so intense that to Levin the squelching sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own heel, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drew it up out of the mire, seemed to be the call of a snipe, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) clutched and pressed the lock of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bang!
<p/>bang!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div><p/>sounded almost in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ear.
<p/>Vassenka had fired at a flock of ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying at that moment towards the sportsmen, far out of range.
<p/>Before Levin had time to look round, there was the whir of one snipe, another, a third, and some eight more rose one after another.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch hit one at the very moment when it was beginning its zigzag movements, and the snipe fell in a heap into the mud.
<p/>Oblonsky aimed deliberately at another, still flying low in the reeds, and together with the report of the shot, that snipe too fell, and it could be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut, its unhurt wing showing white beneath.
<p/>Levin was not so lucky: he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) aimed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) first bird too low, and missed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) aimed at it again, just as it was rising, but at that instant another snipe flew up at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) very feet, distracting him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) missed again.
<p/>While they were loading their guns, another snipe rose, and Veslovsky, who had had time to load again, sent two charges of small-shot into the water.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) snipe, and with sparkling eyes looked at Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now let us separate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and limping on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) left foot, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun in readiness and whistling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dog, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) walked off in one direction.
<p/>Levin and Veslovsky walked in the other.
<p/>It always happened with Levin that when his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) first shots were a failure he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) got hot and out of temper, and shot badly the whole day.
<p/>So it was that day.
<p/>The snipe showed themselves in numbers.
<p/>They kept flying up from just under the dogs, from under the sportsmen's legs, and Levin might have retrieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ill luck.
<p/>But the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shot, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt disgraced in the eyes of Veslovsky, who kept popping away merrily and indiscriminately, killing nothing, and not in the slightest abashed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ill success.
<p/>Levin, in feverish haste, could not restrain himself, got more and more out of temper, and ended by shooting almost without a hope of hitting.
<p/>Laska, indeed, seemed to understand this.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began looking more languidly, and gazed back at the sportsmen, as it were, with perplexity or reproach in her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Shots followed shots in rapid succession.
<p/>The smoke of the powder hung about the sportsmen, while in the great roomy net of the game bag there were only three light little snipe.
<p/>And of these one had been killed by Veslovsky alone, and one by both of them together.
<p/>Meanwhile from the other side of the marsh came the sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch's shots, not frequent, but, as Levin fancied, well-directed, for almost after each they heard <div class="bookquote">``Krak, Krak,  apporte !''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>This excited Levin still more.
<p/>The snipe were floating continually in the air over the reeds.
<p/>Their whirring wings close to the earth, and their harsh cries high in the air, could be heard on all sides; the snipe that had risen first and flown up into the air, settled again before the sportsmen.
<p/>Instead of two hawks there were now dozens of them hovering with shrill cries over the marsh.
<p/>After walking through the larger half of the marsh, Levin and Veslovsky reached the place where the peasants' mowing-grass was divided into long strips reaching to the reeds, marked off in one place by the trampled grass, in another by a path mown through it.
<p/>Half of these strips had already been mown.
<p/>Though there was not so much hope of finding birds in the uncut part as the cut part, Levin had promised Stepan Arkadyevitch to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) walked on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) companion through the cut and uncut patches.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hi, sportsmen!''
 (<font color='red'><b>peasants</b></font>)</div><p/>shouted one of a group of peasants, sitting on an unharnessed cart; <div class="bookquote">``come and have some lunch with us!
<p/>Have a drop of wine!''
 (<font color='red'><b>peasants</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin looked round.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along, it's all right!''
 (<font color='red'><b>a peasant</b></font>)</div><p/>shouted a good-humored-looking bearded peasant with a red face, showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) white teeth in a grin, and holding up a greenish bottle that flashed in the sunlight.  ''
<p/>Qu'est-ce qu'ils disent ?''
<p/>asked Veslovsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They invite you to have some vodka.
<p/>Most likely they've been dividing the meadow into lots.
<p/>I should have some,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, not without some guile, hoping Veslovsky would be tempted by the vodka, and would go away to them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do they offer it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, they're merry-making.
<p/>Really, you should join them.
<p/>You would be interested.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Allons, c'est curieux .''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You go, you go, you'll find the way to the mill!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Levin, and looking round he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) perceived with satisfaction that Veslovsky, bent and stumbling with weariness, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun out at arm's length, was making his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) way out of the marsh towards the peasants.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You come too!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the peasants</b></font>)</div><p/>the peasants shouted to Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never fear!
<p/>You taste our cake!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin felt a strong inclination to drink a little vodka and to eat some bread.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was exhausted, and felt it a great effort to drag his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) staggering legs out of the mire, and for a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hesitated.
<p/>But Laska was setting.
<p/>And immediately all his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) weariness vanished, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) walked lightly through the swamp towards the dog.
<p/>A snipe flew up at his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) feet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) fired and killed it.
<p/>Laska still pointed.--<div class="bookquote">``Fetch it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div><p/>Another bird flew up close to the dog.
<p/>Levin fired.
<p/>But it was an unlucky day for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) missed it, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went to look for the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had shot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not find that either.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wandered all about the reeds, but Laska did not believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) had shot it, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to find it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pretended to hunt for it, but did not really.
<p/>And in the absence of Vassenka, on whom Levin threw the blame of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) failure, things went no better.
<p/>There were plenty of snipe still, but Levin made one miss after another.
<p/>The slanting rays of the sun were still hot; his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) clothes, soaked through with perspiration, stuck to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) body; his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) left boot full of water weighed heavily on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) leg and squeaked at every step; the sweat ran in drops down his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) powder-grimed face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mouth was full of the bitter taste, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) nose of the smell of powder and stagnant water, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ears were ringing with the incessant whir of the snipe; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not touch the stock of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun, it was so hot; his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart beat with short, rapid throbs; his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands shook with excitement, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) weary legs stumbled and staggered over the hillocks and in the swamp, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) walked on and still he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shot.
<p/>At last, after a disgraceful miss, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hat on the ground.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I must control myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to himself.
<p/>Picking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) called Laska, and went out of the swamp.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) got on to dry ground he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) sat down, pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) boot and emptied it, then walked to the marsh, drank some stagnant-tasting water, moistened his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) burning hot gun, and washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) face and hands.
<p/>Feeling refreshed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) went back to the spot where a snipe had settled, firmly resolved to keep cool.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) tried to be calm, but it was the same again.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) finger pressed the cock before he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) had taken a good aim at the bird.
<p/>It got worse and worse.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) had only five birds in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) game-bag when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) walked out of the marsh towards the alders where he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) was to rejoin Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) caught sight of Stepan Arkadyevitch he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) dog.
<p/>Krak darted out from behind the twisted root of an alder, black all over with the stinking mire of the marsh, and with the air of a conqueror sniffed at Laska.
<p/>Behind Krak there came into view in the shade of the alder tree the shapely figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) came to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>), red and perspiring, with unbuttoned neckband, still limping in the same way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?
<p/>You have been popping away!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) said, smiling good-humoredly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How have you got on?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>queried Levin.
<p/>But there was no need to ask, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had already seen the full game bag.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, pretty fair.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had fourteen birds.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A splendid marsh!
<p/>I've no doubt Veslovsky got in your way.
<p/>It's awkward too, shooting with one dog,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, to soften his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) triumph.
<p/>Chapter 11   When Levin and Stepan Arkadyevitch reached the peasant's hut where Levin always used to stay, Veslovsky was already there.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was sitting in the middle of the hut, clinging with both hands to the bench from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was being pulled by a soldier, the brother of the peasant's wife, who was helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) off with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) miry boots.
<p/>Veslovsky was laughing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) infectious, good-humored laugh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've only just come.
<p/>Ils ont √©t√© charmants .
<p/>Just fancy, they gave me drink, fed me!
<p/>Such bread, it was exquisite!
<p/>Delicieux!
<p/>And the vodka, I never tasted any better.
<p/>And they would not take a penny for anything.
<p/>And they kept saying: `Excuse our homely ways.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What should they take anything for?
<p/>They were entertaining you, to be sure.
<p/>Do you suppose they keep vodka for sale?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div><p/>said the soldier, succeeding at last in pulling the soaked boot off the blackened stocking.
<p/>In spite of the dirtiness of the hut, which was all muddied by their boots and the filthy dogs licking themselves clean, and the smell of marsh mud and powder that filled the room, and the absence of knives and forks, the party drank their tea and ate their supper with a relish only known to sportsmen.
<p/>Washed and clean, they went into a hay-barn swept ready for them, where the coachman had been making up beds for the gentlemen.
<p/>Though it was dusk, not one of them wanted to go to sleep.
<p/>After wavering among reminiscences and anecdotes of guns, of dogs, and of former shooting parties, the conversation rested on a topic that interested all of them.
<p/>After Vassenka had several times over expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsmen</b></font>) appreciation of this delightful sleeping place among the fragrant hay, this delightful broken cart -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsmen</b></font>) supposed it to be broken because the shafts had been taken out-RRB-, of the good nature of the peasants that had treated him (<font color='blue'><b>sportsmen</b></font>) to vodka, of the dogs who lay at the feet of their respective masters, Oblonsky began telling them of a delightful shooting party at Malthus's, where he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsmen</b></font>) had stayed the previous summer.
<p/>Malthus was a well-known capitalist, who had made his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsmen</b></font>) money by speculation in railway shares.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch described what grouse moors this Malthus had bought in the Tver province, and how they were preserved, and of the carriages and dogcarts in which the shooting party had been driven, and the luncheon pavilion that had been rigged up at the marsh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, sitting up in the hay; <div class="bookquote">``how is it such people don't disgust you?
<p/>I can understand a lunch with Lafitte is all very pleasant, but don't you dislike just that very sumptuousness?
<p/>All these people, just like our spirit monopolists in old days, get their money in a way that gains them the contempt of everyone.
<p/>They don't care for their contempt, and then they use their dishonest gains to buy off the contempt they have deserved.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly true!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>chimed in Vassenka Veslovsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly!
<p/>Oblonsky, of course, goes out of  bonhomie , but other people say: `Well, Oblonsky stays with them.'...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin could hear that Oblonsky was smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) spoke.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I simply don't consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) more dishonest than any other wealthy merchant or nobleman.
<p/>They've all made their money alike--by their work and their intelligence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, by what work?
<p/>Do you call it work to get hold of concessions and speculate with them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it's work.
<p/>Work in this sense, that if it were not for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and others like him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), there would have been no railways.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that's not work, like the work of a peasant or a learned profession.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Granted, but it's work in the sense that his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) activity produces a result--the railways.
<p/>But of course you think the railways useless.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, that's another question; I am prepared to admit that they're useful.
<p/>But all profit that is out of proportion to the labor expended is dishonest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But who is to define what is proportionate?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Making profit by dishonest means, by trickery,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not draw a distinct line between honesty and dishonesty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such as banking, for instance,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's an evil--the amassing of huge fortunes without labor, just the same thing as with the spirit monopolies, it's only the form that's changed.
<p/>Le roi est mort, vive le roi .
<p/>No sooner were the spirit monopolies abolished than the railways came up, and banking companies; that, too, is profit without work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that may all be very true and clever....
<p/>Lie down, Krak!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch called to his (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) dog, who was scratching and turning over all the hay.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) was obviously convinced of the correctness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) position, and so talked serenely and without haste.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have not drawn the line between honest and dishonest work.
<p/>That I receive a bigger salary than my chief clerk, though he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) knows more about the work than I do--that's dishonest, I suppose?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but I can tell you: your receiving some five thousand, let's say, for your work on the land, while our host, the peasant here, however hard he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) works, can never get more than fifty roubles, is just as dishonest as my earning more than my chief clerk, and Malthus getting more than a station-master.
<p/>No, quite the contrary; I see that society takes up a sort of antagonistic attitude to these people, which is utterly baseless, and I fancy there's envy at the bottom of it...''   (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, that's unfair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div>said Veslovsky; <div class="bookquote">``how could envy come in?

 (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin went on, <div class="bookquote">``that it's unjust for me to receive five thousand, while the peasant has fifty; that's true.
<p/>It is unfair, and I feel it, but...''   (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It really is.
<p/>Why is it we spend our time riding, drinking, shooting, doing nothing, while they are forever at work?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vassenka Veslovsky, obviously for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) life reflecting on the question, and consequently considering it with perfect sincerity.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you feel it, but you don't give him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) your property,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, intentionally, as it seemed, provoking Levin.
<p/>There had arisen of late something like a secret antagonism between the two brothers-in-law; as though, since they had married sisters, a kind of rivalry had sprung up between them as to which was ordering his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) life best, and now this hostility showed itself in the conversation, as it began to take a personal note.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't give it away, because no one demands that from me, and if I wanted to, I could not give it away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin, <div class="bookquote">``and have no one to give it to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give it to this peasant, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) would not refuse it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, excuse me, but if you consider this inequality is unjust, why is it you don't act accordingly?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I do act negatively on that idea, so far as not trying to increase the difference of position existing between him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) and me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, excuse me, that's a paradox.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there's something of a sophistry about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div>Veslovsky agreed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>our host; so you're not asleep yet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said to the peasant who came into the barn, opening the creaking door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is it you're not asleep?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, how's one to sleep!
<p/>I thought our gentlemen would be asleep, but I heard them chattering.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) added, stepping cautiously with his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) bare feet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And where are you going to sleep?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But listen, there are women's voices singing, and, on my word, not badly too.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I shall go by myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div>said Veslovsky, getting up eagerly, and putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) shoes and stockings.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, gentlemen.
<p/>If it's fun, I'll fetch you.
<p/>You've treated me to some good sport, and I won't forget you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) really is a capital fellow, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, when Veslovsky had gone out and the peasant had closed the door after him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, capital,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin, still thinking of the subject of their conversation just before.
<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had clearly expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thoughts and feelings to the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) capacity, and yet both of them, straightforward men and not fools, had said with one voice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was comforting himself with sophistries.
<p/>This disconcerted him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just this, my dear boy.
<p/>One must do one of two things: either admit that the existing order of society is just, and then stick up for one's rights in it; or acknowledge that you are enjoying unjust privileges, as I do, and then enjoy them and be satisfied.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, if it were unjust, you could not enjoy these advantages and be satisfied--at least I could not.

<p/>Come, let's go!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin did not answer.
<p/>What they had said in the conversation, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) acted justly only in a negative sense, absorbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thoughts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can it be that it's only possible to be just negatively?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was asking himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How strong the smell of the fresh hay is, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely that's not a matter of principle too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt about in the dark for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) cap.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not a matter of principle, but why should I go?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But do you know you are preparing trouble for yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) cap and getting up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose I don't see the line you've taken up with your wife?
<p/>I heard how it's a question of the greatest consequence, whether or not you're to be away for a couple of days' shooting.
<p/>That's all very well as an idyllic episode, but for your whole life that won't answer.
<p/>A man must be independent; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) masculine interests.
<p/>A man has to be manly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div>said Oblonsky, opening the door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way?
<p/>To go running after servant girls?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not, if it amuses him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)?
<p/>√áa ne tire pas a consequence .
<p/>It won't do my wife any harm, and it'll amuse me.
<p/>The great thing is to respect the sanctity of the home.
<p/>There should be nothing in the home.
<p/>But don't tie your own hands.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin dryly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) side.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tomorrow, early, I want to go shooting, and I won't wake anyone, and shall set off at daybreak.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Messieurs, venez vite! ''
<p/>they heard the voice of Veslovsky coming back.  ''
<p/>Charmante!
<p/>I've made such a discovery.
<p/>Charmante!
<p/>a perfect Gretchen, and I've already made friends with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretchen</b></font>).
<p/>Really, exceedingly pretty,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) declared in a tone of approval, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Gretchen</b></font>) had been made pretty entirely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) account, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) satisfaction with the entertainment that had been provided for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Levin pretended to be asleep, while Oblonsky, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) slippers, and lighting a cigar, walked out of the barn, and soon their voices were lost.
<p/>For a long while Levin could not get to sleep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard the horses munching hay, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard the peasant and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) elder boy getting ready for the night, and going off for the night watch with the beasts, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard the soldier arranging his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bed on the other side of the barn, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) nephew, the younger son of their peasant host.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard the boy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shrill little voice telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) uncle what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought about the dogs, who seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) huge and terrible creatures, and asking what the dogs were going to hunt next day, and the soldier in a husky, sleepy voice, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) the sportsmen were going in the morning to the marsh, and would shoot with their guns; and then, to check the boy's questions, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Go to sleep, Vaska; go to sleep, or you'll catch it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and soon after he (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) began snoring himself, and everything was still.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) could only hear the snort of the horses, and the guttural cry of a snipe.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it really only negative?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) repeated to himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what of it?
<p/>It's not my fault.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) began thinking about the next day.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tomorrow I'll go out early, and I'll make a point of keeping cool.
<p/>There are lots of snipe; and there are grouse too.
<p/>When I come back there'll be the note from Kitty.
<p/>Yes, Stiva may be right, I'm not manly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), I'm tied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) apron-strings.... Well, it can't be helped!
<p/>Negative again...''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Half asleep, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) heard the laughter and mirthful talk of Veslovsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>For an instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) eyes: the moon was up, and in the open doorway, brightly lighted up by the moonlight, they were standing talking.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying something of the freshness of one girl, comparing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to a freshly peeled nut, and Veslovsky with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) infectious laugh was repeating some words, probably said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vaska</b></font>) by a peasant: <div class="bookquote">``Ah, you do your best to get round her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>a peasant</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin, half asleep, said:  <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, tomorrow before daylight!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>and fell asleep.
<p/>Chapter 12   Waking up at earliest dawn, Levin tried to wake his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) companions.
<p/>Vassenka, lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stomach, with one leg in a stocking thrust out, was sleeping so soundly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could elicit no response.
<p/>Oblonsky, half asleep, declined to get up so early.
<p/>Even Laska, who was asleep, curled up in the hay, got up unwillingly, and lazily stretched out and straightened her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hind legs one after the other.
<p/>Getting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) boots and stockings, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) gun, and carefully opening the creaking door of the barn, Levin went out into the road.
<p/>The coachmen were sleeping in their carriages, the horses were dozing.
<p/>Only one was lazily eating oats, dipping its nose into the manger.
<p/>It was still gray out-of-doors.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why are you up so early, my dear?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>the old woman, their hostess, said, coming out of the hut and addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) affectionately as an old friend.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Going shooting, granny.
<p/>Do I go this way to the marsh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Straight out at the back; by our threshing floor, my dear, and hemp patches; there's a little footpath.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepping carefully with her (<font color='blue'><b>granny</b></font>) sunburnt, bare feet, the old woman conducted Levin, and moved back the fence for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) by the threshing floor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Straight on and you'll come to the marsh.
<p/>Our lads drove the cattle there yesterday evening.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Laska</b></font>)</div><p/>Laska ran eagerly forward along the little path.
<p/>Levin followed her (<font color='blue'><b>granny</b></font>) with a light, rapid step, continually looking at the sky.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hoped the sun would not be up before he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) reached the marsh.
<p/>But the sun did not delay.
<p/>The moon, which had been bright when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went out, by now shone only like a crescent of quicksilver.
<p/>The pink flush of dawn, which one could not help seeing before, now had to be sought to be discerned at all.
<p/>What were before undefined, vague blurs in the distant countryside could now be distinctly seen.
<p/>They were sheaves of rye.
<p/>The dew, not visible till the sun was up, wetted Levin's legs and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) blouse above his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) belt in the high growing, fragrant hemp patch, from which the pollen had already fallen out.
<p/>In the transparent stillness of morning the smallest sounds were audible.
<p/>A bee flew by Levin's ear with the whizzing sound of a bullet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looked carefully, and saw a second and a third.
<p/>They were all flying from the beehives behind the hedge, and they disappeared over the hemp patch in the direction of the marsh.
<p/>The path led straight to the marsh.
<p/>The marsh could be recognized by the mist which rose from it, thicker in one place and thinner in another, so that the reeds and willow bushes swayed like islands in this mist.
<p/>At the edge of the marsh and the road, peasant boys and men, who had been herding for the night, were lying, and in the dawn all were asleep under their coats.
<p/>Not far from them were three hobbled horses.
<p/>One of them clanked a chain.
<p/>Laska walked beside her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) master, pressing a little forward and looking round.
<p/>Passing the sleeping peasants and reaching the first reeds, Levin examined his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pistols and let his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dog off.
<p/>One of the horses, a sleek, dark-brown three-year-old, seeing the dog, started away, switched its tail and snorted.
<p/>The other horses too were frightened, and splashing through the water with their hobbled legs, and drawing their hoofs out of the thick mud with a squelching sound, they bounded out of the marsh.
<p/>Laska stopped, looking ironically at the horses and inquiringly at Levin.
<p/>Levin patted Laska, and whistled as a sign that she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) might begin.
<p/>Laska ran joyfully and anxiously through the slush that swayed under her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>).
<p/>Running into the marsh among the familiar scents of roots, marsh plants, and slime, and the extraneous smell of horse dung, Laska detected at once a smell that pervaded the whole marsh, the scent of that strong-smelling bird that always excited her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) more than any other.
<p/>Here and there among the moss and marsh plants this scent was very strong, but it was impossible to determine in which direction it grew stronger or fainter.
<p/>To find the direction, she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) had to go farther away from the wind.
<p/>Not feeling the motion of her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) legs, Laska bounded with a stiff gallop, so that at each bound she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) could stop short, to the right, away from the wind that blew from the east before sunrise, and turned facing the wind.
<p/>Sniffing in the air with dilated nostrils, she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) felt at once that not their tracks only but they themselves were here before her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>), and not one, but many.
<p/>Laska slackened her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) speed.
<p/>They were here, but where precisely she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) could not yet determine.
<p/>To find the very spot, she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) began to make a circle, when suddenly her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) master's voice drew her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) off.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laska!
<p/>here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) asked, pointing her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) to a different direction.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) stopped, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) had better not go on doing as she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) had begun.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) command in an angry voice, pointing to a spot covered with water, where there could not be anything.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>), pretending she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) was looking, so as to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>), went round it, and went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) former position, and was at once aware of the scent again.
<p/>Now when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) was not hindering her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) knew what to do, and without looking at what was under her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) feet, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) vexation stumbling over a high stump into the water, but righting herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) strong, supple legs, she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) began making the circle which was to make all clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>).
<p/>The scent of them reached her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>), stronger and stronger, and more and more defined, and all at once it became perfectly clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) that one of them was here, behind this tuft of reeds, five paces in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) stopped, and her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) whole body was still and rigid.
<p/>On her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) short legs she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) could see nothing in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>), but by the scent she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) knew it was sitting not more than five paces off.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) stood still, feeling more and more conscious of it, and enjoying it in anticipation.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) tail was stretched straight and tense, and only wagging at the extreme end.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) mouth was slightly open, her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) ears raised.
<p/>One ear had been turned wrong side out as she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) ran up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) breathed heavily but warily, and still more warily looked round, but more with her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) eyes than her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) head, to her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) master.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was coming along with the face she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) knew so well, though the eyes were always terrible to her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) stumbled over the stump as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) came, and moved, as she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) thought, extraordinarily slowly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) came slowly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was running.
<p/>Noticing Laska's special attitude as she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) crouched on the ground, as it were, scratching big prints with her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) hind paws, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) mouth slightly open, Levin knew she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) was pointing at grouse, and with an inward prayer for luck, especially with the first bird, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ran up to her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>).
<p/>Coming quite close up to her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) height look beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes what she (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) was seeing with her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) nose.
<p/>In a space between two little thickets, at a couple of yards' distance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could see a grouse.
<p/>Turning its head, it was listening.
<p/>Then lightly preening and folding its wings, it disappeared round a corner with a clumsy wag of its tail.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fetch it, fetch it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>shouted Levin, giving Laska a shove from behind.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laska</b></font>)</div>thought Laska.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where am I to go?
<p/>From here I feel them, but if I move forward I shall know nothing of where they are or who they are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But then he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) shoved her (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) knee, and in an excited whisper said, <div class="bookquote">``Fetch it, Laska.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if that's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) wishes, I'll do it, but I can't answer for myself now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) thought, and darted forward as fast as her (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) legs would carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) between the thick bushes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) scented nothing now; she (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) could only see and hear, without understanding anything.
<p/>Ten paces from her (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) former place a grouse rose with a guttural cry and the peculiar round sound of its wings.
<p/>And immediately after the shot it splashed heavily with its white breast on the wet mire.
<p/>Another bird did not linger, but rose behind Levin without the dog.
<p/>When Levin turned towards it, it was already some way off.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shot caught it.
<p/>Flying twenty paces further, the second grouse rose upwards, and whirling round like a ball, dropped heavily on a dry place.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, this is going to be some good!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Levin, packing the warm and fat grouse into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) game bag.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, Laska, will it be good?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>When Levin, after loading his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun, moved on, the sun had fully risen, though unseen behind the storm-clouds.
<p/>The moon had lost all of its luster, and was like a white cloud in the sky.
<p/>Not a single star could be seen.
<p/>The sedge, silvery with dew before, now shone like gold.
<p/>The stagnant pools were all like amber.
<p/>The blue of the grass had changed to yellow-green.
<p/>The marsh birds twittered and swarmed about the brook and upon the bushes that glittered with dew and cast long shadows.
<p/>A hawk woke up and settled on a haycock, turning its head from side to side and looking discontentedly at the marsh.
<p/>Crows were flying about the field, and a bare-legged boy was driving the horses to an old man, who had got up from under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) long coat and was combing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair.
<p/>The smoke from the gun was white as milk over the green of the grass.
<p/>One of the boys ran up to Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Uncle, there were ducks here yesterday!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shouted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) walked a little way off behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>And Levin was doubly pleased, in sight of the boy, who expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) approval, at killing three snipe, one after another, straight off.
<p/>Chapter 13   The sportsman's saying, that if the first beast or the first bird is not missed, the day will be lucky, turned out correct.
<p/>At ten o'clock Levin, weary, hungry, and happy after a tramp of twenty miles, returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) night's lodging with nineteen head of fine game and one duck, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tied to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) belt, as it would not go into the game bag.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) companions had long been awake, and had had time to get hungry and have breakfast.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a bit, wait a bit, I know there are nineteen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, counting a second time over the grouse and snipe, that looked so much less important now, bent and dry and bloodstained, with heads crooked aside, than they did when they were flying.
<p/>The number was verified, and Stepan Arkadyevitch's envy pleased Levin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was pleased too on returning to find the man sent by Kitty with a note was already there.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am perfectly well and happy.
<p/>If you were uneasy about me, you can feel easier than ever.
<p/>I've a new bodyguard, Marya Vlasyevna,'' (<font color='red'><b>this the midwife personage</b></font>)</div>--this was the midwife, a new and important personage in Levin's domestic life.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) has come to have a look at me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) found me perfectly well, and we have kept her (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) till you are back.
<p/>All are happy and well, and please, don't be in a hurry to come back, but, if the sport is good, stay another day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>These two pleasures, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lucky shooting and the letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife, were so great that two slightly disagreeable incidents passed lightly over Levin.
<p/>One was that the chestnut trace horse, who had been unmistakably overworked on the previous day, was off his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) feed and out of sorts.
<p/>The coachman said he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``Overdriven yesterday, Konstantin Dmitrievitch.
<p/>Yes, indeed!
<p/>driven ten miles with no sense!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The other unpleasant incident, which for the first minute destroyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) good humor, though later he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) laughed at it a great deal, was to find that of all the provisions Kitty had provided in such abundance that one would have thought there was enough for a week, nothing was left.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) way back, tired and hungry from shooting, Levin had so distinct a vision of meat-pies that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) approached the hut he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) seemed to smell and taste them, as Laska had smelt the game, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) immediately told Philip to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Laska</b></font>) some.
<p/>It appeared that there were no pies left, nor even any chicken.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, this fellow's appetite!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing and pointing at Vassenka Veslovsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never suffer from loss of appetite, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s really marvelous!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it can't be helped,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, looking gloomily at Veslovsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Philip, give me some beef, then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The beef's been eaten, and the bones given to the dogs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip</b></font>)</div>answered Philip.
<p/>Levin was so hurt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, in a tone of vexation, <div class="bookquote">``You might have left me something!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt ready to cry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then put away the game,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said in a shaking voice to Philip, trying not to look at Vassenka, <div class="bookquote">``and cover them with some nettles.
<p/>And you might at least ask for some milk for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Philip</b></font>)</div><p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had drunk some milk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) felt ashamed immediately at having shown his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) annoyance to a stranger, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) began to laugh at his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hungry mortification.
<p/>In the evening they went shooting again, and Veslovsky had several successful shots, and in the night they drove home.
<p/>Their homeward journey was as lively as their drive out had been.
<p/>Veslovsky sang songs and related with enjoyment his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) adventures with the peasants, who had regaled him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) with vodka, and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Excuse our homely ways,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) night's adventures with kiss-in-the-ring and the servant-girl and the peasant, who had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) married, and on learning that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was not, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Well, mind you don't run after other men's wives--you'd better get one of your own.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>These words had particularly amused Veslovsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Altogether, I've enjoyed our outing awfully.
<p/>And you, Levin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have, very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin said quite sincerely.
<p/>It was particularly delightful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to have got rid of the hostility he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been feeling towards Vassenka Veslovsky at home, and to feel instead the most friendly disposition to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 14   Next day at ten o'clock Levin, who had already gone his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) rounds, knocked at the room where Vassenka had been put for the night.  ''
<p/>Entrez! ''
<p/>Veslovsky called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, I've only just finished my ablutions,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, smiling, standing before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) underclothes only.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mind me, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin sat down in the window.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you slept well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like the dead.
<p/>What sort of day is it for shooting?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will you take, tea or coffee?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither.
<p/>I'll wait till lunch.
<p/>I'm really ashamed.
<p/>I suppose the ladies are down?
<p/>A walk now would be capital.
<p/>You show me your horses.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>After walking about the garden, visiting the stable, and even doing some gymnastic exercises together on the parallel bars, Levin returned to the house with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) guest, and went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) into the drawing room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We had splendid shooting, and so many delightful experiences!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div><p/>said Veslovsky, going up to Kitty, who was sitting at the samovar.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity ladies are cut off from these delights!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must say something to the lady of the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin said to himself.
<p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fancied something in the smile, in the all-conquering air with which their guest addressed Kitty....
<p/>The princess, sitting on the other side of the table with Marya Vlasyevna and Stepan Arkadyevitch, called Levin to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vlasyevna</b></font>) side, and began to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) about moving to Moscow for Kitty's confinement, and getting ready rooms for them.
<p/>Just as Levin had disliked all the trivial preparations for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wedding, as derogatory to the grandeur of the event, now he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt still more offensive the preparations for the approaching birth, the date of which they reckoned, it seemed, on their fingers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tried to turn a deaf ear to these discussions of the best patterns of long clothes for the coming baby; tried to turn away and avoid seeing the mysterious, endless strips of knitting, the triangles of linen, and so on, to which Dolly attached special importance.
<p/>The birth of a son -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was certain it would be a son-RRB- which was promised him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), but which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) still could not believe in--so marvelous it seemed--presented itself to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mind, on one hand, as a happiness so immense, and therefore so incredible; on the other, as an event so mysterious, that this assumption of a definite knowledge of what would be, and consequent preparation for it, as for something ordinary that did happen to people, jarred on him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) as confusing and humiliating.
<p/>But the princess did not understand his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) feelings, and put down his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) reluctance to think and talk about it to carelessness and indifference, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) no peace.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had commissioned Stepan Arkadyevitch to look at a flat, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) called Levin up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing about it, princess.
<p/>Do as you think fit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must decide when you will move.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I really don't know.
<p/>I know millions of children are born away from Moscow, and doctors...why...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But if so...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, as Kitty wishes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't talk to Kitty about it!
<p/>Do you want me to frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)?
<p/>Why, this spring Natalia Golitzina died from having an ignorant doctor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do just what you say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said gloomily.
<p/>The princess began talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).
<p/>Though the conversation with the princess had indeed jarred upon him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was gloomy, not on account of that conversation, but from what he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) saw at the samovar.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's impossible,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) thought, glancing now and then at Vassenka bending over Kitty, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) something with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) charming smile, and at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), flushed and disturbed.
<p/>There was something not nice in Vassenka's attitude, in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eyes, in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) smile.
<p/>Levin even saw something not nice in Kitty's attitude and look.
<p/>And again the light died away in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Again, as before, all of a sudden, without the slightest transition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt cast down from a pinnacle of happiness, peace, and dignity, into an abyss of despair, rage, and humiliation.
<p/>Again everything and everyone had become hateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do just as you think best, princess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said again, looking round.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heavy is the cap of Monomach,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>Stepan Arkadyevitch said playfully, hinting, evidently, not simply at the princess's conversation, but at the cause of Levin's agitation, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had noticed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How late you are today, Dolly!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Everyone</b></font>)</div><p/>Everyone got up to greet Darya Alexandrovna.
<p/>Vassenka only rose for an instant, and with the lack of courtesy to ladies characteristic of the modern young man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scarcely bowed, and resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conversation again, laughing at something.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been worried about Masha.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) did not sleep well, and is dreadfully tiresome today,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.
<p/>The conversation Vassenka had started with Kitty was running on the same lines as on the previous evening, discussing Anna, and whether love is to be put higher than worldly considerations.
<p/>Kitty disliked the conversation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was disturbed both by the subject and the tone in which it was conducted, and also by the knowledge of the effect it would have on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was too simple and innocent to know how to cut short this conversation, or even to conceal the superficial pleasure afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) by the young man's very obvious admiration.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wanted to stop it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not know what to do.
<p/>Whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knew would be observed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband, and the worst interpretation put on it.
<p/>And, in fact, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) asked Dolly what was wrong with Masha, and Vassenka, waiting till this uninteresting conversation was over, began to gaze indifferently at Dolly, the question struck Levin as an unnatural and disgusting piece of hypocrisy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say, shall we go and look for mushrooms today?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``By all means, please, and I shall come too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) blushed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wanted from politeness to ask Vassenka whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would come, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going, Kostya?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband with a guilty face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) passed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) with a resolute step.
<p/>This guilty air confirmed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) suspicions.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The mechanician came when I was away; I haven't seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) said, not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) went downstairs, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) had time to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) study he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) wife's familiar footsteps running with reckless speed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shortly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are busy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said to the German mechanician; <div class="bookquote">``I want a few words with my husband.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the mechanician</b></font>)</div><p/>The German would have left the room, but Levin said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>):  <div class="bookquote">``Don't disturb yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The train is at three?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the German</b></font>)</div><p/>queried the German.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mustn't be late.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin did not answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), but walked out himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what have you to say to me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in French.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not look her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in the face, and did not care to see that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) condition was trembling all over, and had a piteous, crushed look.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I...I want to say that we can't go on like this; that this is misery...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The servants are here at the sideboard,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said angrily; <div class="bookquote">``don't make a scene.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let's go in here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were standing in the passage.
<p/>Kitty would have gone into the next room, but there the English governess was giving Tanya a lesson.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, come into the garden.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a peasant</b></font>)</div><p/>In the garden they came upon a peasant weeding the path.
<p/>And no longer considering that the peasant could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) tear-stained and his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) agitated face, that they looked like people fleeing from some disaster, they went on with rapid steps, feeling that they must speak out and clear up misunderstandings, must be alone together, and so get rid of the misery they were both feeling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't go on like this!
<p/>It's misery!
<p/>I am wretched; you are wretched.
<p/>What for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) said, when they had at last reached a solitary garden seat at a turn in the lime tree avenue.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But tell me one thing: was there in his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) tone anything unseemly, not nice, humiliatingly horrible?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said, standing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) again in the same position with his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) clenched fists on his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) chest, as he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) that night.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) said in a shaking voice; <div class="bookquote">``but, Kostya, surely you see I'm not to blame?
<p/>All the morning I've been trying to take a tone...but such people ...Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) come?
<p/>How happy we were!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) said, breathless with the sobs that shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>).
<p/>Although nothing had been pursuing them, and there was nothing to run away from, and they could not possibly have found anything very delightful on that garden seat, the gardener saw with astonishment that they passed him (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) on their way home with comforted and radiant faces.
<p/>Chapter 15   After escorting his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) wife upstairs, Levin went to Dolly's part of the house.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) part, was in great distress too that day.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was walking about the room, talking angrily to a little girl, who stood in the corner roaring.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you shall stand all day in the corner, and have your dinner all alone, and not see one of your dolls, and I won't make you a new frock,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said, not knowing how to punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) is a disgusting child!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) turned to Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where does she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) get such wicked propensities?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what has she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin said without much interest, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had wanted to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) advice, and so was annoyed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had come at an unlucky moment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Grisha and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) went into the raspberries, and there...I can't tell you really what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) did.
<p/>It's a thousand pities Miss Elliot's not with us.
<p/>This one sees to nothing--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)'s a machine....   Figurez-vous que la petite ?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>And Darya Alexandrovna described Masha's crime.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That proves nothing; it's not a question of evil propensities at all, it's simply mischief,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are upset about something?
<p/>What have you come for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's going on there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>And in the tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) question Levin heard that it would be easy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had meant to say.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've not been in there, I've been alone in the garden with Kitty.
<p/>We've had a quarrel for the second time since...Stiva came.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) shrewd, comprehending eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, tell me, honor bright, has there been...not in Kitty, but in that gentleman's behavior, a tone which might be unpleasant-- not unpleasant, but horrible, offensive to a husband?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean, how shall I say....  Stay, stay in the corner!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said to Masha, who, detecting a faint smile in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother's face, had been turning round.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The opinion of the world would be that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is behaving as young men do behave.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin gloomily; <div class="bookquote">``but you noticed it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not only I, but Stiva noticed it.
<p/>Just after breakfast he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to me in so many words,  Je crois que Veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour √† Kitty .''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's all right then; now I'm satisfied.
<p/>I'll send him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean!
<p/>Are you crazy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly cried in horror; <div class="bookquote">``nonsense, Kostya, only think!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said, laughing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can go now to Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said to Masha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, if you wish it, I'll speak to Stiva.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>)'ll take him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) can say you're expecting visitors.
<p/>Altogether he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) doesn't fit into the house.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, I'll do it myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you'll quarrel with him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit.
<p/>I shall so enjoy it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes flashing with real enjoyment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>), Dolly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) won't do it again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said of the little sinner, who had not gone to Fanny, but was standing irresolutely before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother, waiting and looking up from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brows to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother's eye.
<p/>The mother glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>The child broke into sobs, hid her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's lap, and Dolly laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) thin, tender hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is there in common between us and him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Levin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went off to look for Veslovsky.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) passed through the passage he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gave orders for the carriage to be got ready to drive to the station.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The spring was broken yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>the footman</b></font>)</div>said the footman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, the covered trap, then, and make haste.
<p/>Where's the visitor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The gentleman's gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) room.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin came upon Veslovsky at the moment when the latter, having unpacked his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) things from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) trunk, and laid out some new songs, was putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gaiters to go out riding.
<p/>Whether there was something exceptional in Levin's face, or that Vassenka was himself conscious that  ce petit brin de cour  he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was making was out of place in this family, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was somewhat -LRB-as much as a young man in society can be-RRB- disconcerted at Levin's entrance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ride in gaiters?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's much cleaner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div>said Vassenka, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fat leg on a chair, fastening the bottom hook, and smiling with simple-hearted good humor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was undoubtedly a good-natured fellow, and Levin felt sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and ashamed of himself, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) host, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw the shy look on Vassenka's face.
<p/>On the table lay a piece of stick which they had broken together that morning, trying their strength.
<p/>Levin took the fragment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands and began smashing it up, breaking bits off the stick, not knowing how to begin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted...''   (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) paused, but suddenly, remembering Kitty and everything that had happened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, looking him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) resolutely in the face: <div class="bookquote">``I have ordered the horses to be put-to for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div><p/>Vassenka began in surprise.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To drive where?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For you to drive to the station,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin said gloomily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going away, or has something happened?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It happens that I expect visitors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) strong fingers more and more rapidly breaking off the ends of the split stick.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'm not expecting visitors, and nothing has happened, but I beg you to go away.
<p/>You can explain my rudeness as you like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div><p/>Vassenka drew himself up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg you to explain...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said with dignity, understanding at last.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't explain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin said softly and deliberately, trying to control the trembling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) jaw; <div class="bookquote">``and you'd better not ask.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>And as the split ends were all broken off, Levin clutched the thick ends in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) finger, broke the stick in two, and carefully caught the end as it fell.
<p/>Probably the sight of those nervous fingers, of the muscles he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had proved that morning at gymnastics, of the glittering eyes, the soft voice, and quivering jaws, convinced Vassenka better than any words.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bowed, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shoulders, and smiling contemptuously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I not see Oblonsky?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>The shrug and the smile did not irritate Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What else was there for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought.

 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch said when, after hearing from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) friend that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was being turned out of the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) found Levin in the garden, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was walking about waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) guest's departure.  ''
<p/>Mais c'est ridicule!
<p/>What fly has stung you?
<p/>Mais c'est du dernier ridicule!
<p/>What did you think, if a young man...''  But the place where Levin had been stung was evidently still sore, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) turned pale again, when Stepan Arkadyevitch would have enlarged on the reason, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) himself cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) short.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't go into it!
<p/>I can't help it.
<p/>I feel ashamed of how I'm treating you and him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>But it won't be, I imagine, a great grief to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to go, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) presence was distasteful to me and to my wife.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's insulting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)!

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, this I didn't expect of you!
<p/>On peut √™tre jaloux, mais √† ce point, c'est du dernier ridicule! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin turned quickly, and walked away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) into the depths of the avenue, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went on walking up and down alone.
<p/>Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard the rumble of the trap, and saw from behind the trees how Vassenka, sitting in the hay -LRB-unluckily there was no seat in the trap-RRB- in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) Scotch cap, was driven along the avenue, jolting up and down over the ruts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin thought, when a footman ran out of the house and stopped the trap.
<p/>It was the mechanician, whom Levin had totally forgotten.
<p/>The mechanician, bowing low, said something to Veslovsky, then clambered into the trap, and they drove off together.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch and the princess were much upset by Levin's action.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) himself felt not only in the highest degree ridicule , but also utterly guilty and disgraced.
<p/>But remembering what sufferings he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife had been through, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) asked himself how he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) should act another time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) should do just the same again.
<p/>In spite of all this, towards the end of that day, everyone except the princess, who could not pardon Levin's action, became extraordinarily lively and good humored, like children after a punishment or grown-up people after a dreary, ceremonious reception, so that by the evening Vassenka's dismissal was spoken of, in the absence of the princess, as though it were some remote event.
<p/>And Dolly, who had inherited her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) father's gift of humorous storytelling, made Varenka helpless with laughter as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) related for the third and fourth time, always with fresh humorous additions, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had only just put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) new shoes for the benefit of the visitor, and on going into the drawing room, heard suddenly the rumble of the trap.
<p/>And who should be in the trap but Vassenka himself, with his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) Scotch cap, and his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) songs and his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) gaiters, and all, sitting in the hay.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If only you'd ordered out the carriage!
<p/>But no!
<p/>and then I hear: `Stop!'
<p/>Oh, I thought they've relented.
<p/>I look out, and behold a fat German being sat down by him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) and driving away.... And my new shoes all for nothing!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 16   Darya Alexandrovna carried out her (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) intention and went to see Anna.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was sorry to annoy her (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) sister and to do anything Levin disliked.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) quite understood how right the Levins were in not wishing to have anything to do with Vronsky.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) must go and see Anna, and show her (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) feelings could not be changed, in spite of the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) position.
<p/>That she (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) might be independent of the Levins in this expedition, Darya Alexandrovna sent to the village to hire horses for the drive; but Levin learning of it went to her (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) to protest.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes you suppose that I dislike your going?
<p/>But, even if I did dislike it, I should still more dislike your not taking my horses,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You never told me that you were going for certain.
<p/>Hiring horses in the village is disagreeable to me, and, what's of more importance, they'll undertake the job and never get you there.
<p/>I have horses.
<p/>And if you don't want to wound me, you'll take mine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>Darya Alexandrovna had to consent, and on the day fixed Levin had ready for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sister-in-law a set of four horses and relays, getting them together from the farm- and saddle-horses--not at all a smart-looking set, but capable of taking Darya Alexandrovna the whole distance in a single day.
<p/>At that moment, when horses were wanted for the princess, who was going, and for the midwife, it was a difficult matter for Levin to make up the number, but the duties of hospitality would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) allow Darya Alexandrovna to hire horses when staying in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) house.
<p/>Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was well aware that the twenty roubles that would be asked for the journey were a serious matter for her (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>); Darya Alexandrovna's pecuniary affairs, which were in a very unsatisfactory state, were taken to heart by the Levins as if they were their own.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna, by Levin's advice, started before daybreak.
<p/>The road was good, the carriage comfortable, the horses trotted along merrily, and on the box, besides the coachman, sat the counting-house clerk, whom Levin was sending instead of a groom for greater security.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna dozed and waked up only on reaching the inn where the horses were to be changed.
<p/>After drinking tea at the same well-to-do peasant's with whom Levin had stayed on the way to Sviazhsky's, and chatting with the women about their children, and with the old man about Count Vronsky, whom the latter praised very highly, Darya Alexandrovna, at ten o'clock, went on again.
<p/>At home, looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) children, she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) had no time to think.
<p/>So now, after this journey of four hours, all the thoughts she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) had suppressed before rushed swarming into her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) brain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) thought over all her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) life as she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) never had before, and from the most different points of view.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) thoughts seemed strange even to herself.
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) thought about the children, about whom she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) was uneasy, although the princess and Kitty -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) reckoned more upon her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)-RRB- had promised to look after them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If only Masha does not begin her (<font color='blue'><b>Masha</b></font>) naughty tricks, if Grisha isn't kicked by a horse, and Lily's stomach isn't upset again!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) thought.
<p/>But these questions of the present were succeeded by questions of the immediate future.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) began thinking how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had to get a new flat in Moscow for the coming winter, to renew the drawing room furniture, and to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) elder girl a cloak.
<p/>Then questions of the more remote future occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>): how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was to place her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) children in the world.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The girls are all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``but the boys?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very well that I'm teaching Grisha, but of course that's only because I am free myself now, I'm not with child.
<p/>Stiva, of course, there's no counting on.
<p/>And with the help of good-natured friends I can bring them up; but if there's another baby coming?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div><p/>And the thought struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) how untruly it was said that the curse laid on woman was that in sorrow she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) should bring forth children.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The birth itself, that's nothing; but the months of carrying the child--that's what's so intolerable,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) thought, picturing to herself her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) last pregnancy, and the death of the last baby.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) recalled the conversation she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had just had with the young woman at the inn.
<p/>On being asked whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had any children, the handsome young woman had answered cheerfully:  <div class="bookquote">``I had a girl baby, but God set me free; I buried her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) last Lent.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, did you grieve very much for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Darya Alexandrovna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why grieve?
<p/>The old man has grandchildren enough as it is.
<p/>It was only a trouble.
<p/>No working, nor nothing.
<p/>Only a tie.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>This answer had struck Darya Alexandrovna as revolting in spite of the good-natured and pleasing face of the young woman; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not help recalling these words.
<p/>In those cynical words there was indeed a grain of truth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, altogether,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>thought Darya Alexandrovna, looking back over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whole existence during those fifteen years of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) married life, <div class="bookquote">``pregnancy, sickness, mental incapacity, indifference to everything, and most of all--hideousness.
<p/>Kitty, young and pretty as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) is, even Kitty has lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) looks; and I when I'm with child become hideous, I know it.
<p/>The birth, the agony, the hideous agonies, that last moment...then the nursing, the sleepless nights, the fearful pains...''   (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>Darya Alexandrovna shuddered at the mere recollection of the pain from sore breasts which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had suffered with almost every child.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then the children's illnesses, that everlasting apprehension; then bringing them up; evil propensities''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) thought of little Masha's crime among the raspberries-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``education, Latin--it's all so incomprehensible and difficult.
<p/>And on the top of it all, the death of these children.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Masha/Masha Tchibisova</b></font>)</div><p/>And there rose again before her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) imagination the cruel memory, that always tore her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother's heart, of the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) last little baby, who had died of croup; his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) funeral, the callous indifference of all at the little pink coffin, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own torn heart, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) lonely anguish at the sight of the pale little brow with its projecting temples, and the open, wondering little mouth seen in the coffin at the moment when it was being covered with the little pink lid with a cross braided on it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And all this, what's it for?
<p/>What is to come of it all?
<p/>That I'm  wasting my life, never having a moment's peace, either with child, or nursing a child, forever irritable, peevish, wretched myself and worrying others, repulsive to my husband, while the children are growing up unhappy, badly educated, and penniless.
<p/>Even now, if it weren't for spending the summer at the Levins', I don't know how we should be managing to live.
<p/>Of course Kostya and Kitty have so much tact that we don't feel it; but it can't go on.
<p/>They'll have children, they won't be able to keep us; it's a drag on them as it is.
<p/>How is papa, who has hardly anything left for himself, to help us?
<p/>So that I can't even bring the children up by myself, and may find it hard with the help of other people, at the cost of humiliation.
<p/>Why, even if we suppose the greatest good luck, that the children don't die, and I bring them up somehow.
<p/>At the very best they'll simply be decent people.
<p/>That's all I can hope for.
<p/>And to gain simply that--what agonies, what toil!...
<p/>One's whole life ruined!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) recalled what the young peasant woman had said, and again she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) was revolted at the thought; but she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) could not help admitting that there was a grain of brutal truth in the words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it far now, Mihail?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>Darya Alexandrovna asked the counting house clerk, to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) mind from thoughts that were frightening her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``From this village, they say, it's five miles.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The carriage drove along the village street and onto a bridge.
<p/>On the bridge was a crowd of peasant women with coils of ties for the sheaves on their shoulders, gaily and noisily chattering.
<p/>They stood still on the bridge, staring inquisitively at the carriage.
<p/>All the faces turned to Darya Alexandrovna looked to her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) healthy and happy, making her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) envious of their enjoyment of life.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're all living, they're all enjoying life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>Darya Alexandrovna still mused when she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) had passed the peasant women and was driving uphill again at a trot, seated comfortably on the soft springs of the old carriage, ``while I, let out, as it were from prison, from the world of worries that fret me to death, am only looking about me now for an instant.
<p/>They all live; those peasant women and my sister Natalia and Varenka and Anna, whom I am going to see--all, but not I.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And they attack Anna.
<p/>What for?
<p/>am I any better?
<p/>I have, anyway, a husband I love--not as I should like to love him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), still I do love him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), while Anna never loved hers.
<p/>How is she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to blame?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wants to live.
<p/>God has put that in our hearts.
<p/>Very likely I should have done the same.
<p/>Even to this day I don't feel sure I did right in listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) at that terrible time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) came to me in Moscow.
<p/>I ought then to have cast off my husband and have begun my life fresh.
<p/>I might have loved and have been loved in reality.
<p/>And is it any better as it is?
<p/>I don't respect him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s necessary to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``and I put up with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>Is that any better?
<p/>At that time I could still have been admired, I had beauty left me still,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>Darya Alexandrovna pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thoughts, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would have liked to look at herself in the looking glass.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had a traveling looking glass in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) handbag, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wanted to take it out; but looking at the backs of the coachman and the swaying counting house clerk, she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) would be ashamed if either of them were to look round, and she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) did not take out the glass.
<p/>But without looking in the glass, she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) thought that even now it was not too late; and she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) thought of Sergey Ivanovitch, who was always particularly attentive to her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>), of Stiva's good-hearted friend, Turovtsin, who had helped her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) children through the scarlatina, and was in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>).
<p/>And there was someone else, a quite young man, who--her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) husband had told her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) it as a joke--thought her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) more beautiful than either of her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) sisters.
<p/>And the most passionate and impossible romances rose before Darya Alexandrovna's imagination.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna did quite right, and certainly I shall never reproach her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) for it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is happy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) makes another person happy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)'s not broken down as I am, but most likely just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) always was, bright, clever, open to every impression,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>thought Darya Alexandrovna,--and a sly smile curved her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lips, for, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pondered on Anna's love affair, Darya Alexandrovna constructed on parallel lines an almost identical love affair for herself, with an imaginary composite figure, the ideal man who was in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), like Anna, confessed the whole affair to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband.
<p/>And the amazement and perplexity of Stepan Arkadyevitch at this avowal made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) smile.
<p/>In such daydreams she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) reached the turning of the highroad that led to Vozdvizhenskoe.
<p/>Chapter 17   The coachman pulled up his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) four horses and looked round to the right, to a field of rye, where some peasants were sitting on a cart.
<p/>The counting house clerk was just going to jump down, but on second thoughts he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shouted peremptorily to the peasants instead, and beckoned to them to come up.
<p/>The wind, that seemed to blow as they drove, dropped when the carriage stood still; gadflies settled on the steaming horses that angrily shook them off.
<p/>The metallic clank of a whetstone against a scythe, that came to them from the cart, ceased.
<p/>One of the peasants got up and came towards the carriage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you are slow!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the house clerk</b></font>)</div><p/>the counting house clerk shouted angrily to the peasant who was stepping slowly with his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) bare feet over the ruts of the rough dry road.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along, do!''
 (<font color='red'><b>A man</b></font>)</div><p/>A curly-headed old man with a bit of bast tied round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bent back dark with perspiration, came towards the carriage, quickening his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) steps, and took hold of the mud-guard with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sunburnt hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vozdvizhenskoe, the manor house?

 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>Darya Alexandrovna said vaguely, not knowing how to ask about Anna, even of this peasant.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At home for sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>the peasant</b></font>)</div>said the peasant, shifting from one bare foot to the other, and leaving a distinct print of five toes and a heel in the dust.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) turned round and called to a lad, who was shouting something to him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) from the cart.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!

<p/>They'll be home by now.

 (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We've come a long way,''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>said the coachman, climbing onto the box.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it's not far?''

<p/>As soon as you get out...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) said, keeping hold all the while of the carriage.
<p/>A healthy-looking, broad-shouldered young fellow came up too.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, is it laborers they want for the harvest?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, my boy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you keep to the left, and you'll come right on it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the peasant</b></font>)</div>said the peasant, unmistakably loth to let the travelers go, and eager to converse.

<p/>Hi, friend!
<p/>Stop!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the peasant</b></font>)</div><p/>called the two voices.
<p/>The coachman stopped.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're coming!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See what a turn-out!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) said, pointing to four persons on horseback, and two in a  char-√†-banc , coming along the road.
<p/>They were Vronsky with a jockey, Veslovsky and Anna on horseback, and Princess Varvara and Sviazhsky in the  char-√†-banc .
<p/>They had gone out to look at the working of a new reaping machine.
<p/>When the carriage stopped, the party on horseback were coming at a walking pace.
<p/>Anna was in front beside Veslovsky.
<p/>Anna, quietly walking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) horse, a sturdy English cob with cropped mane and short tail, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) beautiful head with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) black hair straying loose under her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) high hat, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) full shoulders, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) slender waist in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) black riding habit, and all the ease and grace of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) deportment, impressed Dolly.
<p/>For the first minute it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) unsuitable for Anna to be on horseback.
<p/>The conception of riding on horseback for a lady was, in Darya Alexandrovna's mind, associated with ideas of youthful flirtation and frivolity, which, in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) opinion, was unbecoming in Anna's position.
<p/>But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had scrutinized her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) closer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was at once reconciled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) riding.
<p/>In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) elegance, everything was so simple, quiet, and dignified in the attitude, the dress and the movements of Anna, that nothing could have been more natural.
<p/>Beside Anna, on a hot-looking gray cavalry horse, was Vassenka Veslovsky in his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) Scotch cap with floating ribbons, his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stout legs stretched out in front, obviously pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own appearance.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna could not suppress a good-humored smile as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>Behind rode Vronsky on a dark bay mare, obviously heated from galloping.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in, pulling at the reins.
<p/>After him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rode a little man in the dress of a jockey.
<p/>Sviazhsky and Princess Varvara in a new  char-√†-banc  with a big, raven-black trotting horse, overtook the party on horseback.
<p/>Anna's face suddenly beamed with a joyful smile at the instant when, in the little figure huddled in a corner of the old carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) recognized Dolly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) uttered a cry, started in the saddle, and set her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) horse into a gallop.
<p/>On reaching the carriage she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) jumped off without assistance, and holding up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) riding habit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ran up to greet Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it was you and dared not think it.
<p/>How delightful!
<p/>You can't fancy how glad I am!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said, at one moment pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) face against Dolly and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), and at the next holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) off and examining her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a delightful surprise, Alexey!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said, looking round at Vronsky, who had dismounted, and was walking towards them.
<p/>Vronsky, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) tall gray hat, went up to Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't believe how glad we are to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) said, giving peculiar significance to the words, and showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) strong white teeth in a smile.
<p/>Vassenka Veslovsky, without getting off his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) horse, took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) cap and greeted the visitor by gleefully waving the ribbons over his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's Princess Varvara,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>Anna said in reply to a glance of inquiry from Dolly as the  char-√†-banc  drove up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Darya Alexandrovna, and unconsciously her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) face betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) dissatisfaction.
<p/>Princess Varvara was her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) husband's aunt, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had long known her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), and did not respect her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) knew that Princess Varvara had passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) whole life toadying on her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) rich relations, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) should now be sponging on Vronsky, a man who was nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), mortified Dolly on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) kinship with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) husband.
<p/>Anna noticed Dolly's expression, and was disconcerted by it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) blushed, dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) riding habit, and stumbled over it.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna went up to the  char-√†-banc  and coldly greeted Princess Varvara.
<p/>Sviazhsky too she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) knew.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) inquired how his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) queer friend with the young wife was, and running his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes over the ill-matched horses and the carriage with its patched mud-guards, proposed to the ladies that they should get into the char-√†-banc .
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'll get into this vehicle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The horse is quiet, and the princess drives capitally.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, stay as you were,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, coming up, <div class="bookquote">``and we'll go in the carriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>and taking Dolly's arm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) away.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna's eyes were fairly dazzled by the elegant carriage of a pattern she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had never seen before, the splendid horses, and the elegant and gorgeous people surrounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/>But what struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) most of all was the change that had taken place in Anna, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew so well and loved.
<p/>Any other woman, a less close observer, not knowing Anna before, or not having thought as Darya Alexandrovna had been thinking on the road, would not have noticed anything special in Anna.
<p/>But now Dolly was struck by that temporary beauty, which is only found in women during the moments of love, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) saw now in Anna's face.
<p/>Everything in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face, the clearly marked dimples in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cheeks and chin, the line of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lips, the smile which, as it were, fluttered about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face, the brilliance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes, the grace and rapidity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) movements, the fulness of the notes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) voice, even the manner in which, with a sort of angry friendliness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) answered Veslovsky when he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) asked permission to get on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cob, so as to teach it to gallop with the right leg foremost--it was all peculiarly fascinating, and it seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) were herself aware of it, and rejoicing in it.
<p/>When both the women were seated in the carriage, a sudden embarrassment came over both of them.
<p/>Anna was disconcerted by the intent look of inquiry Dolly fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Dolly was embarrassed because after Sviazhsky's phrase about <div class="bookquote">``this vehicle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) could not help feeling ashamed of the dirty old carriage in which Anna was sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>The coachman Philip and the counting house clerk were experiencing the same sensation.
<p/>The counting house clerk, to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) confusion, busied himself settling the ladies, but Philip the coachman became sullen, and was bracing himself not to be overawed in future by this external superiority.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) smiled ironically, looking at the raven horse, and was already deciding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own mind that this smart trotter in the  char-√†-banc  was only good for promenade , and wouldn't do thirty miles straight off in the heat.
<p/>The peasants had all got up from the cart and were inquisitively and mirthfully staring at the meeting of the friends, making their comments on it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're pleased, too; haven't seen each other for a long while,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the curly-headed old man with the bast round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Uncle Gerasim, if we could take that raven horse now, to cart the corn, that `ud be quick work!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look-ee!
<p/>Is that a woman in breeches?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div><p/>said one of them, pointing to Vassenka Veslovsky sitting in a side saddle.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, a man!
<p/>See how smartly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s going it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, lads!
<p/>seems we're not going to sleep, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What chance of sleep today!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>said the old man, with a sidelong look at the sun.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Midday's past, look-ee!
<p/>Get your hooks, and come along!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 18   Anna looked at Dolly's thin, care-worn face, with its wrinkles filled with dust from the road, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was on the point of saying what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was thinking, that is, that Dolly had got thinner.
<p/>But, conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) herself had grown handsomer, and that Dolly's eyes were telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) sighed and began to speak about herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are looking at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and wondering how I can be happy in my position?
<p/>Well!
<p/>it's shameful to confess, but I...
<p/>I'm inexcusably happy.
<p/>Something magical has happened to me, like a dream, when you're frightened, panic-stricken, and all of a sudden you wake up and all the horrors are no more.
<p/>I have waked up.
<p/>I have lived through the misery, the dread, and now for a long while past, especially since we've been here, I've been so happy!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said, with a timid smile of inquiry looking at Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How glad I am!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dolly smiling, involuntarily speaking more coldly than she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) wanted to.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very glad for you.
<p/>Why haven't you written to me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?...
<p/>Because I hadn't the courage....  You forget my position...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To me?
<p/>Hadn't the courage?
<p/>If you knew how I...I look at...''   (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>Darya Alexandrovna wanted to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) thoughts of the morning, but for some reason it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) now out of place to do so.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But of that we'll talk later.
<p/>What's this, what are all these buildings?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) asked, wanting to change the conversation and pointing to the red and green roofs that came into view behind the green hedges of acacia and lilac.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite a little town.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>But Anna did not answer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!
<p/>How do you look at my position, what do you think of it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I consider...''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>Darya Alexandrovna was beginning, but at that instant Vassenka Veslovsky, having brought the cob to gallop with the right leg foremost, galloped past them, bumping heavily up and down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) short jacket on the chamois leather of the side saddle.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>)'s doing it, Anna Arkadyevna!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) shouted.
<p/>Anna did not even glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>); but again it seemed to Darya Alexandrovna out of place to enter upon such a long conversation in the carriage, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cut short her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but I always loved you, and if one loves anyone, one loves the whole person, just as they are and not as one would like them to be...''   (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Anna, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes off her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) friend's face and dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyelids -LRB-this was a new habit Dolly had not seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) before-RRB-, pondered, trying to penetrate the full significance of the words.
<p/>And obviously interpreting them as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) would have wished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) glanced at Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you had any sins,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``they would all be forgiven you for your coming to see me and these words.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And Dolly saw that tears stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) pressed Anna's hand in silence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what are these buildings?
<p/>How many there are of them!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>After a moment's silence she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``These are the servants' houses, barns, and stables,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>answered Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And there the park begins.
<p/>It had all gone to ruin, but Alexey had everything renewed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) is very fond of this place, and, what I never expected, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) has become intensely interested in looking after it.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) is such a rich nature!
<p/>Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) takes up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) does splendidly.
<p/>So far from being bored by it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) works with passionate interest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>)--with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) temperament as I know it--he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) has become careful and businesslike, a first-rate manager, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) positively reckons every penny in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) management of the land.
<p/>But only in that.
<p/>When it's a question of tens of thousands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) doesn't think of money.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) spoke with that gleefully sly smile with which women often talk of the secret characteristics only known to them--of those they love.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you see that big building?
<p/>that's the new hospital.
<p/>I believe it will cost over a hundred thousand; that's his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) hobby just now.
<p/>And do you know how it all came about?
<p/>The peasants asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) for some meadowland, I think it was, at a cheaper rate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) refused, and I accused him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) of being miserly.
<p/>Of course it was not really because of that, but everything together, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) began this hospital to prove, do you see, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) was not miserly about money.
<p/>C'est une petitesse , if you like, but I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) all the more for it.
<p/>And now you'll see the house in a moment.
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) grandfather's house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) has had nothing changed outside.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How beautiful!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dolly, looking with involuntary admiration at the handsome house with columns, standing out among the different-colored greens of the old trees in the garden.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it fine?
<p/>And from the house, from the top, the view is wonderful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>laborers</b></font>)</div><p/>They drove into a courtyard strewn with gravel and bright with flowers, in which two laborers were at work putting an edging of stones round the light mould of a flower bed, and drew up in a covered entry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, they're here already!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna, looking at the saddle horses, which were just being led away from the steps.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a nice horse, isn't it?
<p/>It's my cob; my favorite.
<p/>Lead him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) here and bring me some sugar.
<p/>Where is the count?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) inquired of two smart footmen who darted out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, seeing Vronsky coming to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with Veslovsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going to put the princess?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vronsky in French, addressing Anna, and without waiting for a reply, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) once more greeted Darya Alexandrovna, and this time he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think the big balcony room.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, that's too far off!
<p/>Better in the corner room, we shall see each other more.
<p/>Come, let's go up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) favorite horse the sugar the footman had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).  ''
<p/>Et vous oubliez votre devoir ,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to Veslovsky, who came out too on the steps.  ''
<p/>Pardon, j'en ai tout plein les poches ,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) answered, smiling, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) waistcoat pocket.  ''
<p/>Mais vous venez trop tard ,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) handkerchief on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand, which the horse had made wet in taking the sugar.
<p/>Anna turned to Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can stay some time?
<p/>For one day only?
<p/>That's impossible!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I promised to be back, and the children...''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, feeling embarrassed both because she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) bag out of the carriage, and because she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) face must be covered with dust.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Dolly, darling!...
<p/>Well, we'll see.
<p/>Come along, come along!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>and Anna led Dolly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) room.
<p/>That room was not the smart guest chamber Vronsky had suggested, but the one of which Anna had said that Dolly would excuse it.
<p/>And this room, for which excuse was needed, was more full of luxury than any in which Dolly had ever stayed, a luxury that reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) of the best hotels abroad.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, darling, how happy I am!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna said, sitting down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) riding habit for a moment beside Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me about all of you.
<p/>Stiva I had only a glimpse of, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) cannot tell one about the children.
<p/>How is my favorite, Tanya?
<p/>Quite a big girl, I expect?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>)'s very tall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>Darya Alexandrovna answered shortly, surprised herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) should respond so coolly about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) children.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are having a delightful stay at the Levins',''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) added.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if I had known,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, <div class="bookquote">``that you do not despise me!...
<p/>You might have all come to us.
<p/>Stiva's an old friend and a great friend of Alexey's, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) added, and suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) blushed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but we are all...''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>Dolly answered in confusion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But in my delight I'm talking nonsense.
<p/>The one thing, darling, is that I am so glad to have you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't told me yet how and what you think about me, and I keep wanting to know.
<p/>But I'm glad you will see me as I am.
<p/>The chief thing I shouldn't like would be for people to imagine I want to prove anything.
<p/>I don't want to prove anything; I merely want to live, to do no one harm but myself.
<p/>I have the right to do that, haven't I?
<p/>But it is a big subject, and we'll talk over everything properly later.
<p/>Now I'll go and dress and send a maid to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 19   Left alone, Darya Alexandrovna, with a good housewife's eye, scanned her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) room.
<p/>All she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) had seen in entering the house and walking through it, and all she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) saw now in her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) room, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) an impression of wealth and sumptuousness and of that modern European luxury of which she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) had only read in English novels, but had never seen in Russia and in the country.
<p/>Everything was new from the new French hangings on the walls to the carpet which covered the whole floor.
<p/>The bed had a spring mattress, and a special sort of bolster and silk pillowcases on the little pillows.
<p/>The marble washstand, the dressing table, the little sofa, the tables, the bronze clock on the chimney piece, the window curtains, and the  porti√®res  were all new and expensive.
<p/>The smart maid, who came in to offer her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) services, with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) hair done up high, and a gown more fashionable than Dolly's, was as new and expensive as the whole room.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) neatness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) deferential and obliging manners, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) felt ill at ease with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) felt ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) seeing the patched dressing jacket that had unluckily been packed by mistake for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was ashamed of the very patches and darned places of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had been so proud at home.
<p/>At home it had been so clear that for six dressing jackets there would be needed twenty-four yards of nainsook at sixteen pence the yard, which was a matter of thirty shillings besides the cutting-out and making, and these thirty shillings had been saved.
<p/>But before the maid she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) felt, if not exactly ashamed, at least uncomfortable.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna had a great sense of relief when Annushka, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had known for years, walked in.
<p/>The smart maid was sent for to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) mistress, and Annushka remained with Darya Alexandrovna.
<p/>Annushka was obviously much pleased at that lady's arrival, and began to chatter away without a pause.
<p/>Dolly observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was longing to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) opinion in regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) mistress's position, especially as to the love and devotion of the count to Anna Arkadyevna, but Dolly carefully interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) began to speak about this.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I grew up with Anna Arkadyevna; my lady's dearer to me than anything.
<p/>Well, it's not for us to judge.
<p/>And, to be sure, there seems so much love...''   (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Kindly pour out the water for me to wash now, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>Darya Alexandrovna cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) short.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly.
<p/>We've two women kept specially for washing small things, but most of the linen's done by machinery.
<p/>The count goes into everything himself.
<p/>Ah, what a husband!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly was glad when Anna came in, and by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) entrance put a stop to Annushka's gossip.
<p/>Anna had put on a very simple batiste gown.
<p/>Dolly scrutinized that simple gown attentively.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew what it meant, and the price at which such simplicity was obtained.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An old friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna of Annushka.
<p/>Anna was not embarrassed now.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was perfectly composed and at ease.
<p/>Dolly saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had now completely recovered from the impression her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) arrival had made on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), and had assumed that superficial, careless tone which, as it were, closed the door on that compartment in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) deeper feelings and ideas were kept.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Anna, and how is your little girl?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Annie?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-This was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) little daughter Anna.-RRB-
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) has got on wonderfully.
<p/>Would you like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)?
<p/>Come, I'll show her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to you.
<p/>We had a terrible bother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) began telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``over nurses.
<p/>We had an Italian wet-nurse.
<p/>A good creature, but so stupid!
<p/>We wanted to get rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), but the baby is so used to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that we've gone on keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) still.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how have you managed?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly was beginning a question as to what name the little girl would have; but noticing a sudden frown on Anna's face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) changed the drift of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you manage?
<p/>have you weaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) yet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>But Anna had understood.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't mean to ask that?
<p/>You meant to ask about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) surname.
<p/>Yes?
<p/>That worries Alexey.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) has no name--that is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)'s a Karenina,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyelids till nothing could be seen but the eyelashes meeting.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we'll talk about all that later,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face suddenly brightening.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, I'll show you her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Elle est tres gentille .
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elle</b></font>) crawls now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>In the nursery the luxury which had impressed Dolly in the whole house struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) still more.
<p/>There were little go-carts ordered from England, and appliances for learning to walk, and a sofa after the fashion of a billiard table, purposely constructed for crawling, and swings and baths, all of special pattern, and modern.
<p/>They were all English, solid, and of good make, and obviously very expensive.
<p/>The room was large, and very light and lofty.
<p/>When they went in, the baby, with nothing on but her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) little smock, was sitting in a little elbow chair at the table, having her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) dinner of broth, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was spilling all over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) little chest.
<p/>The baby was being fed, and the Russian nursery maid was evidently sharing her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) meal.
<p/>Neither the wet-nurse nor the head nurse were there; they were in the next room, from which came the sound of their conversation in the queer French which was their only means of communication.
<p/>Hearing Anna's voice, a smart, tall, English nurse with a disagreeable face and a dissolute expression walked in at the door, hurriedly shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fair curls, and immediately began to defend herself though Anna had not found fault with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>At every word Anna said, the English nurse said hurriedly several times, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, my lady.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the English nurse</b></font>)</div><p/>The rosy baby with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) black eyebrows and hair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sturdy red little body with tight goose-flesh skin, delighted Darya Alexandrovna in spite of the cross expression with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stared at the stranger.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) positively envied the baby's healthy appearance.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was delighted, too, at the baby's crawling.
<p/>Not one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own children had crawled like that.
<p/>When the baby was put on the carpet and its little dress tucked up behind, it was wonderfully charming.
<p/>Looking round like some little wild animal at the grown-up big people with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bright black eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) smiled, unmistakably pleased at their admiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) legs sideways, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pressed vigorously on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) arms, and rapidly drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) whole back up after, and then made another step forward with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) little arms.
<p/>But the whole atmosphere of the nursery, and especially the English nurse, Darya Alexandrovna did not like at all.
<p/>It was only on the supposition that no good nurse would have entered so irregular a household as Anna's that Darya Alexandrovna could explain to herself how Anna with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) insight into people could take such an unprepossessing, disreputable-looking woman as nurse to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) child.
<p/>Besides, from a few words that were dropped, Darya Alexandrovna saw at once that Anna, the two nurses, and the child had no common existence, and that the mother's visit was something exceptional.
<p/>Anna wanted to get the baby her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) plaything, and could not find it.
<p/>Most amazing of all was the fact that on being asked how many teeth the baby had, Anna answered wrong, and knew nothing about the two last teeth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I sometimes feel sorry I'm so superfluous here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, going out of the nursery and holding up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) skirt so as to escape the plaything standing in the doorway.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was very different with my first child.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I expected it to be the other way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>said Darya Alexandrovna shyly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!
<p/>By the way, do you know I saw Seryozha?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna, screwing up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes, as though looking at something far away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we'll talk about that later.
<p/>You wouldn't believe it, I'm like a hungry beggar woman when a full dinner is set before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does not know what to begin on first.
<p/>The dinner is you, and the talks I have before me with you, which I could never have with anyone else; and I don't know which subject to begin upon first.
<p/>Mais je ne vous ferai grace de rien .
<p/>I must have everything out with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I ought to give you a sketch of the company you will meet with us,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll begin with the ladies.
<p/>Princess Varvara--you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), and I know your opinion and Stiva's about her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>).
<p/>Stiva says the whole aim of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) existence is to prove her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) superiority over Auntie Katerina Pavlovna: that's all true; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)'s a good-natured woman, and I am so grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>).
<p/>In Petersburg there was a moment when a chaperon was absolutely essential for me.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) turned up.
<p/>But really she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) is good- natured.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) did a great deal to alleviate my position.
<p/>I see you don't understand all the difficulty of my position...there in Petersburg,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) added.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here I'm perfectly at ease and happy.
<p/>Well, of that later on, though.
<p/>Then Sviazhsky--he (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)'s the marshal of the district, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>)'s a very good sort of a man, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) wants to get something out of Alexey.
<p/>You understand, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) property, now that we are settled in the country, Alexey can exercise great influence.
<p/>Then there's Tushkevitch--you have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>), you know--Betsy's admirer.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>)'s been thrown over and he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>)'s come to see us.
<p/>As Alexey says, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>)'s one of those people who are very pleasant if one accepts them for what they try to appear to be,  et puis il est comme il faut , as Princess Varvara says.
<p/>Then Veslovsky...you know him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>).
<p/>A very nice boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) said, and a sly smile curved her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) lips.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's this wild story about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and the Levins?
<p/>Veslovsky told Alexey about it, and we don't believe it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Men need occupation, and Alexey needs a circle, so I value all these people.

<p/>Alexey has a very high opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>).
<p/>Then the doctor, a young man, not quite a Nihilist perhaps, but you know, eats with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) knife...but a very good doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) doesn't want anything before dinner, but please order some lunch for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), and I'll go and look for Alexey and bring them all in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>Princess Varvara gave Dolly a cordial and rather patronizing reception, and began at once explaining to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was living with Anna because she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had always cared more for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) than her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) sister Katerina Pavlovna, the aunt that had brought Anna up, and that now, when every one had abandoned Anna, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought it her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) duty to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in this most difficult period of transition.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband will give her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) a divorce, and then I shall go back to my solitude; but now I can be of use, and I am doing my duty, however difficult it may be for me--not like some other people.
<p/>And how sweet it is of you, how right of you to have come!
<p/>They live like the best of married couples; it's for God to judge them, not for us.
<p/>And didn't Biryuzovsky and Madame Avenieva...and Sam Nikandrov, and Vassiliev and Madame Mamonova, and Liza Neptunova...  Did no one say anything about them?
<p/>And it has ended by their being received by everyone.
<p/>And then, c'est un int√©rieur si joli, si comme il faut.
<p/>Tout-√†-fait √† l'anglaise.
<p/>On se r√©unit le matin au breakfast, et puis on se s√©pare.
<p/>Everyone does as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) pleases till dinnertime.
<p/>Dinner at seven o'clock.
<p/>Stiva did very rightly to send you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) needs their support.
<p/>You know that through his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mother and brother he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) can do anything.
<p/>And then they do so much good.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) didn't tell you about his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) hospital?
<p/>Ce sera admirable --everything from Paris.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Their conversation was interrupted by Anna, who had found the men of the party in the billiard room, and returned with them to the terrace.
<p/>There was still a long time before the dinner-hour, it was exquisite weather, and so several different methods of spending the next two hours were proposed.
<p/>There were very many methods of passing the time at Vozdvizhenskoe, and these were all unlike those in use at Pokrovskoe.  ''
<p/>Une partie de lawn-tennis, '' Veslovsky proposed, with his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) handsome smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll be partners again, Anna Arkadyevna.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's too hot; better stroll about the garden and have a row in the boat, show Darya Alexandrovna the river banks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky proposed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I agree to anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>said Sviazhsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I imagine that what Dolly would like best would be a stroll-- wouldn't you?
<p/>And then the boat, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.
<p/>So it was decided.
<p/>Veslovsky and Tushkevitch went off to the bathing place, promising to get the boat ready and to wait there for them.
<p/>They walked along the path in two couples, Anna with Sviazhsky, and Dolly with Vronsky.
<p/>Dolly was a little embarrassed and anxious in the new surroundings in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) found herself.
<p/>Abstractly, theoretically, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) did not merely justify, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) positively approved of Anna's conduct.
<p/>As is indeed not unfrequent with women of unimpeachable virtue, weary of the monotony of respectable existence, at a distance she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) not only excused illicit love, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) positively envied it.
<p/>Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) loved Anna with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart.
<p/>But seeing Anna in actual life among these strangers, with this fashionable tone that was so new to Darya Alexandrovna, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt ill at ease.
<p/>What she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) disliked particularly was seeing Princess Varvara ready to overlook everything for the sake of the comforts she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) enjoyed.
<p/>As a general principle, abstractly, Dolly approved of Anna's action; but to see the man for whose sake her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) action had been taken was disagreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had never liked Vronsky.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very proud, and saw nothing in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could be proud except his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wealth.
<p/>But against her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own will, here in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own house, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) overawed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) more than ever, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not be at ease with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the same feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had had with the maid about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dressing jacket.
<p/>Just as with the maid she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had felt not exactly ashamed, but embarrassed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) darns, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not exactly ashamed, but embarrassed at herself.
<p/>Dolly was ill at ease, and tried to find a subject of conversation.
<p/>Even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) supposed that, through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pride, praise of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house and garden would be sure to be disagreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) did all the same tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) liked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's a very fine building, and in the good old-fashioned style,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like so much the court in front of the steps.
<p/>Was that always so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face beamed with pleasure.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you could only have seen that court last spring!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began, at first rather diffidently, but more and more carried away by the subject as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on, to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) attention to the various details of the decoration of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house and garden.
<p/>It was evident that, having devoted a great deal of trouble to improve and beautify his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home, Vronsky felt a need to show off the improvements to a new person, and was genuinely delighted at Darya Alexandrovna's praise.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you would care to look at the hospital, and are not tired, indeed, it's not far.
<p/>Shall we go?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said, glancing into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) face to convince himself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was not bored.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you coming, Anna?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will come, won't we?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, addressing Sviazhsky.  ''
<p/>Mais il ne faut pas laisser le pauvre Veslovsky et Tushkevitch se morfondre l√† dans le bateau.
<p/>We must send and tell them.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, this is a monument he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) is setting up here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, turning to Dolly with that sly smile of comprehension with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had previously talked about the hospital.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's a work of real importance!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Sviazhsky.
<p/>But to show he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was not trying to ingratiate himself with Vronsky, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) promptly added some slightly critical remarks.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder, though, count,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that while you do so much for the health of the peasants, you take so little interest in the schools.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' C'est devenu tellement commun les √©coles, '' said Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You understand it's not on that account, but it just happens so, my interest has been diverted elsewhere.
<p/>This way then to the hospital,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said to Darya Alexandrovna, pointing to a turning out of the avenue.
<p/>The ladies put up their parasols and turned into the side path.
<p/>After going down several turnings, and going through a little gate, Darya Alexandrovna saw standing on rising ground before her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) a large pretentious-looking red building, almost finished.
<p/>The iron roof, which was not yet painted, shone with dazzling brightness in the sunshine.
<p/>Beside the finished building another had been begun, surrounded by scaffolding.
<p/>Workmen in aprons, standing on scaffolds, were laying bricks, pouring mortar out of vats, and smoothing it with trowels.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How quickly work gets done with you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Sviazhsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I was here last time the roof was not on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the autumn it will all be ready.
<p/>Inside almost everything is done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what's this new building?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the house for the doctor and the dispensary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>answered Vronsky, seeing the architect in a short jacket coming towards him (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>); and excusing himself to the ladies, he (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) went to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>).
<p/>Going round a hole where the workmen were slaking lime, he (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) stood still with the architect and began talking rather warmly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The front is still too low,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) said to Anna, who had asked what was the matter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I said the foundation ought to be raised,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course it would have been much better, Anna Arkadyevna,''  (<font color='red'><b>the architect</b></font>)</div>said the architect, <div class="bookquote">``but now it's too late.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the architect</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I take a great interest in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>Anna answered Sviazhsky, who was expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) surprise at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knowledge of architecture.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This new building ought to have been in harmony with the hospital.
<p/>It was an afterthought, and was begun without a plan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky, having finished his (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) talk with the architect, joined the ladies, and led them inside the hospital.
<p/>Although they were still at work on the cornices outside and were painting on the ground floor, upstairs almost all the rooms were finished.
<p/>Going up the broad cast-iron staircase to the landing, they walked into the first large room.
<p/>The walls were stuccoed to look like marble, the huge plate-glass windows were already in, only the parquet floor was not yet finished, and the carpenters, who were planing a block of it, left their work, taking off the bands that fastened their hair, to greet the gentry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the reception room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here there will be a desk, tables, and benches, and nothing more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This way; let us go in here.
<p/>Don't go near the window,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, trying the paint to see if it were dry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexey, the paint's dry already,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) added.
<p/>From the reception room they went into the corridor.
<p/>Here Vronsky showed them the mechanism for ventilation on a novel system.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) showed them marble baths, and beds with extraordinary springs.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) showed them the wards one after another, the storeroom, the linen room, then the heating stove of a new pattern, then the trolleys, which would make no noise as they carried everything needed along the corridors, and many other things.
<p/>Sviazhsky, as a connoisseur in the latest mechanical improvements, appreciated everything fully.
<p/>Dolly simply wondered at all she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had not seen before, and, anxious to understand it all, made minute inquiries about everything, which gave Vronsky great satisfaction.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I imagine that this will be the solitary example of a properly fitted hospital in Russia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>said Sviazhsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And won't you have a lying-in ward?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's so much needed in the country.
<p/>I have often...''   (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>) usual courtesy, Vronsky interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is not a lying-in home, but a hospital for the sick, and is intended for all diseases, except infectious complaints,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>look at this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) rolled up to Darya Alexandrovna an invalid chair that had just been ordered for the convalescents.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) sat down in the chair and began moving it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The patient can't walk--still too weak, perhaps, or something wrong with his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) legs, but he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) must have air, and he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) moves, rolls himself along...''   (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>Darya Alexandrovna was interested by everything.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) liked everything very much, but most of all she (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) liked Vronsky himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) natural, simple-hearted eagerness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)'s a very nice, good man,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) thought several times, not hearing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said, but looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) and penetrating into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) expression, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mentally put herself in Anna's place.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) so much just now with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) eager interest that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) saw how Anna could be in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 21   <div class="bookquote">``No, I think the princess is tired, and horses don't interest her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>Vronsky said to Anna, who wanted to go on to the stables, where Sviazhsky wished to see the new stallion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You go on, while I escort the princess home, and we'll have a little talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if you would like that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) added, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing about horses, and I shall be delighted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>answered Darya Alexandrovna, rather astonished.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) saw by Vronsky's face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) wanted something from her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was not mistaken.
<p/>As soon as they had passed through the little gate back into the garden, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) looked in the direction Anna had taken, and having made sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could neither hear nor see them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) began:  <div class="bookquote">``You guess that I have something I want to say to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with laughing eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not wrong in believing you to be a friend of Anna's.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hat, and taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) handkerchief, wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) head, which was growing bald.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna made no answer, and merely stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) with dismay.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was left alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) suddenly felt afraid; his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) laughing eyes and stern expression scared her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>The most diverse suppositions as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was about to speak of to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) flashed into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) brain.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is going to beg me to come to stay with them with the children, and I shall have to refuse; or to create a set that will receive Anna in Moscow....  Or isn't it Vassenka Veslovsky and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) relations with Anna?
<p/>Or perhaps about Kitty, that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) feels he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was to blame?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>All her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) conjectures were unpleasant, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not guess what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) really wanted to talk about to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have so much influence with Anna, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is so fond of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``do help me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Darya Alexandrovna looked with timid inquiry into his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) energetic face, which under the lime-trees was continually being lighted up in patches by the sunshine, and then passing into complete shadow again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to say more, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) walked in silence beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), scratching with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) cane in the gravel.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have come to see us, you, the only woman of Anna's former friends--I don't count Princess Varvara--but I know that you have done this not because you regard our position as normal, but because, understanding all the difficulty of the position, you still love her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) and want to be a help to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>).
<p/>Have I understood you rightly?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) asked, looking round at her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>answered Darya Alexandrovna, putting down her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) sunshade, <div class="bookquote">``but...''   (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) broke in, and unconsciously, oblivious of the awkward position into which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was putting his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) companion, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stopped abruptly, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had to stop short too.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one feels more deeply and intensely than I do all the difficulty of Anna's position; and that you may well understand, if you do me the honor of supposing I have any heart.
<p/>I am to blame for that position, and that is why I feel it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>said Darya Alexandrovna, involuntarily admiring the sincerity and firmness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said this.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But just because you feel yourself responsible, you exaggerate it, I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) position in the world is difficult, I can well understand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the world it is hell!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) brought out quickly, frowning darkly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't imagine moral sufferings greater than what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went through in Petersburg in that fortnight...and I beg you to believe it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but here, so long as neither Anna...nor you miss society...''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Society!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said contemptuously, <div class="bookquote">``how could I miss society?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So far--and it may be so always--you are happy and at peace.
<p/>I see in Anna that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is happy, perfectly happy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) has had time to tell me so much already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>said Darya Alexandrovna, smiling; and involuntarily, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said this, at the same moment a doubt entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mind whether Anna really were happy.
<p/>But Vronsky, it appeared, had no doubts on that score.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) has revived after all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sufferings; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is happy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is happy in the present.
<p/>But I?...
<p/>I am afraid of what is before us...I beg your pardon, you would like to walk on?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, let us sit here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>Darya Alexandrovna sat down on a garden seat in a corner of the avenue.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stood up facing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) repeated, and the doubt whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) were happy sank more deeply into Darya Alexandrovna's mind.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But can it last?
<p/>Whether we have acted rightly or wrongly is another question, but the die is cast,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said, passing from Russian to French, <div class="bookquote">``and we are bound together for life.
<p/>We are united by all the ties of love that we hold most sacred.
<p/>We have a child, we may have other children.
<p/>But the law and all the conditions of our position are such that thousands of complications arise which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) does not see and does not want to see.
<p/>And that one can well understand.
<p/>But I can't help seeing them.
<p/>My daughter is by law not my daughter, but Karenin's.
<p/>I cannot bear this falsity!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) said, with a vigorous gesture of refusal, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) looked with gloomy inquiry towards Darya Alexandrovna.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) made no answer, but simply gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) went on:  <div class="bookquote">``One day a son may be born, my son, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will be legally a Karenin; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will not be the heir of my name nor of my property, and however happy we may be in our home life and however many children we may have, there will be no real tie between us.
<p/>They will be Karenins.
<p/>You can understand the bitterness and horror of this position!
<p/>I have tried to speak of this to Anna.
<p/>It irritates her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) does not understand, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) I cannot speak plainly of all this.
<p/>Now look at another side.
<p/>I am happy, happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) love, but I must have occupation.
<p/>I have found occupation, and am proud of what I am doing and consider it nobler than the pursuits of my former companions at court and in the army.
<p/>And most certainly I would not change the work I am doing for theirs.
<p/>I am working here, settled in my own place, and I am happy and contented, and we need nothing more to make us happy.
<p/>I love my work here.
<p/>Ce n'est pas un pis-aller,  on the contrary...''   (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Darya Alexandrovna noticed that at this point in his (<font color='blue'><b>companions</b></font>) explanation he (<font color='blue'><b>companions</b></font>) grew confused, and she (<font color='blue'><b>companions</b></font>) did not quite understand this digression, but she (<font color='blue'><b>companions</b></font>) felt that having once begun to speak of matters near his (<font color='blue'><b>companions</b></font>) heart, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>companions</b></font>) could not speak to Anna, he (<font color='blue'><b>companions</b></font>) was now making a clean breast of everything, and that the question of his (<font color='blue'><b>companions</b></font>) pursuits in the country fell into the same category of matters near his (<font color='blue'><b>companions</b></font>) heart, as the question of his (<font color='blue'><b>companions</b></font>) relations with Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I will go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companions</b></font>) said, collecting himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The great thing is that as I work I want to have a conviction that what I am doing will not die with me, that I shall have heirs to come after me,--and this I have not.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paused, evidently much moved.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, I see that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that brings me to the object of my conversation,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, calming himself with an effort.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna can, it depends on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)....

<p/>And now, I know, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would not refuse it.
<p/>It is only a matter of writing to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said plainly at that time that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) expressed the desire, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would not refuse.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) remembered that Anna drooped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyelids just when the deeper questions of life were touched upon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) half-shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own life, so as not to see everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>thought Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, for my own sake and for hers I will talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>Dolly said in reply to his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) look of gratitude.
<p/>They got up and walked to the house.
<p/>Chapter 22   When Anna found Dolly at home before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked intently in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes, as though questioning her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) about the talk she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had had with Vronsky, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) made no inquiry in words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe it's dinner time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've not seen each other at all yet.
<p/>I am reckoning on the evening.
<p/>Now I want to go and dress.

 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) room and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) felt amused.
<p/>To change her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) dress was impossible, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had already put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) best dress.
<p/>But in order to signify in some way her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) preparation for dinner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) asked the maid to brush her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) dress, changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) cuffs and tie, and put some lace on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is all I can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said with a smile to Anna, who came in to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in a third dress, again of extreme simplicity.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we are too formal here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, as it were apologizing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) magnificence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not tired?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no time for talking about anything before dinner.
<p/>Going into the drawing room they found Princess Varvara already there, and the gentlemen of the party in black frock-coats.
<p/>The architect wore a swallow-tail coat.
<p/>Vronsky presented the doctor and the steward to his (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) guest.
<p/>The architect he (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) had already introduced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) at the hospital.
<p/>A stout butler, resplendent with a smoothly shaven round chin and a starched white cravat, announced that dinner was ready, and the ladies got up.
<p/>Vronsky asked Sviazhsky to take in Anna Arkadyevna, and himself offered his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) arm to Dolly.
<p/>Veslovsky was before Tushkevitch in offering his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) arm to Princess Varvara, so that Tushkevitch with the steward and the doctor walked in alone.
<p/>The dinner, the dining room, the service, the waiting at table, the wine, and the food, were not simply in keeping with the general tone of modern luxury throughout all the house, but seemed even more sumptuous and modern.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna watched this luxury which was novel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), and as a good housekeeper used to managing a household--although she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) never dreamed of adapting anything she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) saw to her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) own household, as it was all in a style of luxury far above her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) own manner of living--she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) could not help scrutinizing every detail, and wondering how and by whom it was all done.
<p/>Vassenka Veslovsky, her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) husband, and even Sviazhsky, and many other people she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) knew, would never have considered this question, and would have readily believed what every well-bred host tries to make his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) guests feel, that is, that all that is well-ordered in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) house has cost him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), the host, no trouble whatever, but comes of itself.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna was well aware that even porridge for the children's breakfast does not come of itself, and that therefore, where so complicated and magnificent a style of luxury was maintained, someone must give earnest attention to its organization.
<p/>And from the glance with which Alexey Kirillovitch scanned the table, from the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirillovitch</b></font>) nodded to the butler, and offered Darya Alexandrovna her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) choice between cold soup and hot soup, she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw that it was all organized and maintained by the care of the master of the house himself.
<p/>It was evident that it all rested no more upon Anna than upon Veslovsky.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), Sviazhsky, the princess, and Veslovsky, were equally guests, with light hearts enjoying what had been arranged for them.
<p/>Anna was the hostess only in conducting the conversation.
<p/>The conversation was a difficult one for the lady of the house at a small table with persons present, like the steward and the architect, belonging to a completely different world, struggling not to be overawed by an elegance to which they were unaccustomed, and unable to sustain a large share in the general conversation.
<p/>But this difficult conversation Anna directed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) usual tact and naturalness, and indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did so with actual enjoyment, as Darya Alexandrovna observed.
<p/>The conversation began about the row Tushkevitch and Veslovsky had taken alone together in the boat, and Tushkevitch began describing the last boat races in Petersburg at the Yacht Club.
<p/>But Anna, seizing the first pause, at once turned to the architect to draw him (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) silence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nikolay Ivanitch was struck,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, meaning Sviazhsky, <div class="bookquote">``at the progress the new building had made since he (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) was here last; but I am there every day, and every day I wonder at the rate at which it grows.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's first-rate working with his (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) excellency,''  (<font color='red'><b>the architect</b></font>)</div>said the architect with a smile -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) was respectful and composed, though with a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) own dignity-RRB-.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a very different matter to have to do with the district authorities.
<p/>Where one would have to write out sheaves of papers, here I call upon the count, and in three words we settle the business.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The American way of doing business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>said Sviazhsky, with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there they build in a rational fashion...''   (<font color='red'><b>United</b></font>)</div>The conversation passed to the misuse of political power in the United States, but Anna quickly brought it round to another topic, so as to draw the steward into talk.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever seen a reaping machine?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, addressing Darya Alexandrovna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We had just ridden over to look at one when we met.
<p/>It's the first time I ever saw one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do they work?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly like little scissors.
<p/>A plank and a lot of little scissors.
<p/>Like this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna took a knife and fork in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) beautiful white hands covered with rings, and began showing how the machine worked.
<p/>It was clear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw nothing would be understood from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) explanation; but aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) talk was pleasant and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hands beautiful she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went on explaining.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``More like little penknives,''  (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div>Veslovsky said playfully, never taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) eyes off her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Anna gave a just perceptible smile, but made no answer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it true, Karl Fedoritch, that it's just like little scissors?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to the steward.  ''
<p/>Oh, ja, '' answered the German.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Es it ein ganz einfaches Ding,''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ding</b></font>) began to explain the construction of the machine.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a pity it doesn't bind too.
<p/>I saw one at the Vienna exhibition, which binds with a wire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>said Sviazhsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They would be more profitable in use.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Es kommt drauf an....  Der Preis vom Draht muss ausgerechnet werden.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>And the German, roused from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ding</b></font>) taciturnity, turned to Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Das l√§sst sich ausrechnen, Erlaucht.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The German</b></font>)</div><p/>The German was just feeling in the pocket where were his (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) pencil and the notebook he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) always wrote in, but recollecting that he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) was at a dinner, and observing Vronsky's chilly glance, he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) checked himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Zu compliziert, macht zu viel Klopot,''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) concluded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``W√ºnscht man Dochots, so hat man auch Klopots,''   (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div>said Vassenka Veslovsky, mimicking the German.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``J'adore l'allemand,''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) addressed Anna again with the same smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cessez,''   (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said with playful severity.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We expected to find you in the fields, Vassily Semyonitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to the doctor, a sickly-looking man; <div class="bookquote">``have you been there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I went there, but I had taken flight,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>the doctor answered with gloomy jocoseness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you've taken a good constitutional?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Splendid!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and how was the old woman?
<p/>I hope it's not typhus?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Typhus it is not, but it's taking a bad turn.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna, and having thus paid the dues of civility to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) domestic circle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own friends.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be a hard task, though, to construct a machine from your description, Anna Arkadyevna,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>Sviazhsky said jestingly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, why so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna with a smile that betrayed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew there was something charming in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) disquisitions upon the machine that had been noticed by Sviazhsky.
<p/>This new trait of girlish coquettishness made an unpleasant impression on Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Anna Arkadyevna's knowledge of architecture is marvelous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tushkevitch</b></font>)</div>said Tushkevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, I heard Anna Arkadyevna talking yesterday about plinths and damp-courses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div>said Veslovsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I got it right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing marvelous about it, when one sees and hears so much of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, I dare say, you don't even know what houses are made of?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>Darya Alexandrovna saw that Anna disliked the tone of raillery that existed between her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and Veslovsky, but fell in with it against her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) will.
<p/>Vronsky acted in this matter quite differently from Levin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) obviously attached no significance to Veslovsky's chattering; on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) encouraged his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) jests.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come now, tell us, Veslovsky, how are the stones held together?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By cement, of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bravo!
<p/>And what is cement?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, some sort of paste...no, putty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div>said Veslovsky, raising a general laugh.
<p/>The company at dinner, with the exception of the doctor, the architect, and the steward, who remained plunged in gloomy silence, kept up a conversation that never paused, glancing off one subject, fastening on another, and at times stinging one or the other to the quick.
<p/>Once Darya Alexandrovna felt wounded to the quick, and got so hot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) positively flushed and wondered afterwards whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) had said anything extreme or unpleasant.
<p/>Sviazhsky began talking of Levin, describing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) strange view that machinery is simply pernicious in its effects on Russian agriculture.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not the pleasure of knowing this M. Levin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>Vronsky said, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``but most likely he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) has never seen the machines he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) condemns; or if he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) has seen and tried any, it must have been after a queer fashion, some Russian imitation, not a machine from abroad.
<p/>What sort of views can anyone have on such a subject?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Turkish views, in general,''  (<font color='red'><b>Veslovsky/Vassenka Veslovsky/Vassenka</b></font>)</div>Veslovsky said, turning to Anna with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't defend his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) opinions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>Darya Alexandrovna said, firing up; <div class="bookquote">``but I can say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s a highly cultivated man, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) were here he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would know very well how to answer you, though I am not capable of doing so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) extremely, and we are great friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>Sviazhsky said, smiling good-naturedly.  ''
<p/>Mais pardon, il est un petit peu toqu√©;  he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) maintains, for instance, that district councils and arbitration boards are all of no use, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) is unwilling to take part in anything.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's our Russian apathy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, pouring water from an iced decanter into a delicate glass on a high stem; <div class="bookquote">``we've no sense of the duties our privileges impose upon us, and so we refuse to recognize these duties.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know no man more strict in the performance of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duties,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>said Darya Alexandrovna, irritated by Vronsky's tone of superiority.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For my part,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>pursued Vronsky, who was evidently for some reason or other keenly affected by this conversation, <div class="bookquote">``such as I am, I am, on the contrary, extremely grateful for the honor they have done me, thanks to Nikolay Ivanitch''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) indicated Sviazhsky-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``in electing me a justice of the peace.
<p/>I consider that for me the duty of being present at the session, of judging some peasants' quarrel about a horse, is as important as anything I can do.
<p/>And I shall regard it as an honor if they elect me for the district council.
<p/>It's only in that way I can pay for the advantages I enjoy as a landowner.
<p/>Unluckily they don't understand the weight that the big landowners ought to have in the state.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/>It was strange to Darya Alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) was of being right at his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) own table.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) thought how Levin, who believed the opposite, was just as positive in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) opinions at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own table.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) loved Levin, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) side.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So we can reckon upon you, count, for the coming elections?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Sviazhsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must come a little beforehand, so as to be on the spot by the eighth.
<p/>If you would do me the honor to stop with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather agree with your beau-fr√®re,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, <div class="bookquote">``though not quite on the same ground as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) added with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid that we have too many of these public duties in these latter days.
<p/>Just as in old days there were so many government functionaries that one had to call in a functionary for every single thing, so now everyone's doing some sort of public duty.
<p/>Alexey has been here now six months, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>)'s a member, I do believe, of five or six different public bodies.
<p/>Du train que cela va,  the whole time will be wasted on it.
<p/>And I'm afraid that with such a multiplicity of these bodies, they'll end in being a mere form.
<p/>How many are you a member of, Nikolay Ivanitch?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) turned to Sviazhsky--<div class="bookquote">``over twenty, I fancy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna spoke lightly, but irritation could be discerned in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tone.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna, watching Anna and Vronsky attentively, detected it instantly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) noticed, too, that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) spoke Vronsky's face had immediately taken a serious and obstinate expression.
<p/>Noticing this, and that Princess Varvara at once made haste to change the conversation by talking of Petersburg acquaintances, and remembering what Vronsky had without apparent connection said in the garden of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) work in the country, Dolly surmised that this question of public activity was connected with some deep private disagreement between Anna and Vronsky.
<p/>The dinner, the wine, the decoration of the table were all very good; but it was all like what Darya Alexandrovna had seen at formal dinners and balls which of late years had become quite unfamiliar to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>); it all had the same impersonal and constrained character, and so on an ordinary day and in a little circle of friends it made a disagreeable impression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>After dinner they sat on the terrace, then they proceeded to play lawn tennis.
<p/>The players, divided into two parties, stood on opposite sides of a tightly drawn net with gilt poles on the carefully leveled and rolled croquet-ground.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna made an attempt to play, but it was a long time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could understand the game, and by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did understand it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was so tired that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sat down with Princess Varvara and simply looked on at the players.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) partner, Tushkevitch, gave up playing too, but the others kept the game up for a long time.
<p/>Sviazhsky and Vronsky both played very well and seriously.
<p/>They kept a sharp lookout on the balls served to them, and without haste or getting in each other's way, they ran adroitly up to them, waited for the rebound, and neatly and accurately returned them over the net.
<p/>Veslovsky played worse than the others.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was too eager, but he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) kept the players lively with his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) high spirits.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) laughter and outcries never paused.
<p/>Like the other men of the party, with the ladies' permission, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) coat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) solid, comely figure in his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) white shirt-sleeves, with his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) red perspiring face and his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) impulsive movements, made a picture that imprinted itself vividly on the memory.
<p/>When Darya Alexandrovna lay in bed that night, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) saw Vassenka Veslovsky flying about the croquet ground.
<p/>During the game Darya Alexandrovna was not enjoying herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) did not like the light tone of raillery that was kept up all the time between Vassenka Veslovsky and Anna, and the unnaturalness altogether of grown-up people, all alone without children, playing at a child's game.
<p/>But to avoid breaking up the party and to get through the time somehow, after a rest she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) joined the game again, and pretended to be enjoying it.
<p/>All that day it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) were acting in a theater with actors cleverer than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bad acting was spoiling the whole performance.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had come with the intention of staying two days, if all went well.
<p/>But in the evening, during the game, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would go home next day.
<p/>The maternal cares and worries, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had so hated on the way, now, after a day spent without them, struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in quite another light, and tempted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) back to them.
<p/>When, after evening tea and a row by night in the boat, Darya Alexandrovna went alone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) room, took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dress, and began arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thin hair for the night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had a great sense of relief.
<p/>It was positively disagreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to think that Anna was coming to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) immediately.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) longed to be alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own thoughts.
<p/>Chapter 23   Dolly was wanting to go to bed when Anna came in to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), attired for the night.
<p/>In the course of the day Anna had several times begun to speak of matters near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart, and every time after a few words she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had stopped: <div class="bookquote">``Afterwards, by ourselves, we'll talk about everything.
<p/>I've got so much I want to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/>Now they were by themselves, and Anna did not know what to talk about.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sat in the window looking at Dolly, and going over in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) own mind all the stores of intimate talk which had seemed so inexhaustible beforehand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) found nothing.
<p/>At that moment it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) that everything had been said already.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what of Kitty?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said with a heavy sigh, looking penitently at Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me the truth, Dolly: isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) angry with me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Angry?
<p/>Oh, no!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Darya Alexandrovna, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) hates me, despises me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!
<p/>But you know that sort of thing isn't forgiven.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, turning away and looking out of the open window.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I was not to blame.
<p/>And who is to blame?
<p/>What's the meaning of being to blame?
<p/>Could it have been otherwise?
<p/>What do you think?
<p/>Could it possibly have happened that you didn't become the wife of Stiva?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, I don't know.
<p/>But this is what I want you to tell me...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, but we've not finished about Kitty.
<p/>Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) happy?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s a very nice man, they say.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s much more than very nice.
<p/>I don't know a better man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, how glad I am!
<p/>I'm so glad!
<p/>Much more than very nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) repeated.
<p/>Dolly smiled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But tell me about yourself.
<p/>We've a great deal to talk about.
<p/>And I've had a talk with...''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>Dolly did not know what to call him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) felt it awkward to call him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) either the count or Alexey Kirillovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``With Alexey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, <div class="bookquote">``I know what you talked about.

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How am I to say like that straight off?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, the only woman who came to see me in Petersburg was Betsy Tverskaya?
<p/>You know her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>), of course?
<p/>Au fond, c'est la femme la plus deprave√© qui existe.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) had an intrigue with Tushkevitch, deceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) husband in the basest way.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) told me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) did not care to know me so long as my position was irregular.
<p/>Don't imagine I would compare...I know you, darling.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) repeated.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was unhappy on your account and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own.
<p/>Perhaps you will say that it's egoism, but what a legitimate and noble egoism.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wants first of all to legitimize his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) daughter, and to be your husband, to have a legal right to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What wife, what slave can be so utterly a slave as I, in my position?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) put in gloomily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The chief thing he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) desires...he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) desires that you should not suffer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's impossible.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and the most legitimate desire--he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) wishes that your children should have a name.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What children?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna said, not looking at Dolly, and half closing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Annie and those to come...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) need not trouble on that score; I shall have no more children.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you tell that you won't?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not, because I don't wish it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>And, in spite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) emotion, Anna smiled, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) caught the na√Øve expression of curiosity, wonder, and horror on Dolly's face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The doctor told me after my illness...''   (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Impossible!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dolly, opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) eyes wide.
<p/>For her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) this was one of those discoveries the consequences and deductions from which are so immense that all that one feels for the first instant is that it is impossible to take it all in, and that one will have to reflect a great, great deal upon it.
<p/>This discovery, suddenly throwing light on all those families of one or two children, which had hitherto been so incomprehensible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), aroused so many ideas, reflections, and contradictory emotions, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had nothing to say, and simply gazed with wide-open eyes of wonder at Anna.
<p/>This was the very thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been dreaming of, but now learning that it was possible, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was horrified.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that it was too simple a solution of too complicated a problem.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``N'est-ce pas immoral?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, after a brief pause.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so?
<p/>Think, I have a choice between two alternatives: either to be with child, that is an invalid, or to be the friend and companion of my husband--practically my husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>Anna said in a tone intentionally superficial and frivolous.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>said Darya Alexandrovna, hearing the very arguments she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had used to herself, and not finding the same force in them as before.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For you, for other people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, as though divining her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thoughts, <div class="bookquote">``there may be reason to hesitate; but for me....  You must consider, I am not his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) loves me as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) loves me.
<p/>And how am I to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) love?
<p/>Not like this!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) white hands in a curve before her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) waist with extraordinary rapidity, as happens during moments of excitement; ideas and memories rushed into Darya Alexandrovna's head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``did not keep my attraction for Stiva; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) left me for others, and the first woman for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) betrayed me did not keep him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) by being always pretty and lively.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and took another.
<p/>And can Anna attract and keep Count Vronsky in that way?
<p/>If that is what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looks for, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will find dresses and manners still more attractive and charming.
<p/>And however white and beautiful her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bare arms are, however beautiful her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) full figure and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eager face under her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) black curls, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will find something better still, just as my disgusting, pitiful, and charming husband does.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly made no answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) merely sighed.
<p/>Anna noticed this sigh, indicating dissent, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went on.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) armory she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had other arguments so strong that no answer could be made to them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you say that it's not right?
<p/>But you must consider,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went on; <div class="bookquote">``you forget my position.
<p/>How can I desire children?
<p/>I'm not speaking of the suffering, I'm not afraid of that.
<p/>Think only, what are my children to be?
<p/>Ill-fated children, who will have to bear a stranger's name.
<p/>For the very fact of their birth they will be forced to be ashamed of their mother, their father, their birth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that is just why a divorce is necessary.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>But Anna did not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) longed to give utterance to all the arguments with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had so many times convinced herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is reason given me for, if I am not to use it to avoid bringing unhappy beings into the world!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked at Dolly, but without waiting for a reply she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went on:  <div class="bookquote">``I should always feel I had wronged these unhappy children,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If they are not, at any rate they are not unhappy; while if they are unhappy, I alone should be to blame for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>These were the very arguments Darya Alexandrovna had used in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own reflections; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heard them without understanding them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can one wrong creatures that don't exist?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought.
<p/>And all at once the idea struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>): could it possibly, under any circumstances, have been better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) favorite Grisha if he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had never existed?
<p/>And this seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) so wild, so strange, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head to drive away this tangle of whirling, mad ideas.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't know; it's not right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, with an expression of disgust on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but you mustn't forget that you and I....  And besides that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>added Anna, in spite of the wealth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) arguments and the poverty of Dolly's objections, seeming still to admit that it was not right, <div class="bookquote">``don't forget the chief point, that I am not now in the same position as you.
<p/>For you the question is:  do you desire not to have any more children; while for me it is: do I desire to have them?
<p/>And that's a great difference.
<p/>You must see that I can't desire it in my position.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Darya Alexandrovna made no reply.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) suddenly felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had got far away from Anna; that there lay between them a barrier of questions on which they could never agree, and about which it was better not to speak.
<p/>Chapter 24   <div class="bookquote">``Then there is all the more reason for you to legalize your position, if possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, speaking all at once in an utterly different tone, subdued and mournful.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely you don't mean a divorce is impossible?
<p/>I was told your husband had consented to it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly, I don't want to talk about that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we won't then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div>Darya Alexandrovna hastened to say, noticing the expression of suffering on Anna's face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All I see is that you take too gloomy a view of things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I?

<p/>It's just as it might be with your Grisha....

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>-- she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) suddenly changed the subject--<div class="bookquote">``you say I take too gloomy a view of things.
<p/>You can't understand.

<p/>I don't think about it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) repeated, and a flush rose into her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) got up, straightening her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) chest, and sighed heavily.
<p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) light step she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) began pacing up and down the room, stopping now and then.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think of it?
<p/>Not a day, not an hour passes that I don't think of it, and blame myself for thinking of it...because thinking of that may drive me mad.
<p/>Drive me mad!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) repeated.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I think of it, I can't sleep without morphine.
<p/>But never mind.

<p/>They tell me, divorce.
<p/>In the first place, he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) won't give me a divorce.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)'s under the influence of Countess Lidia Ivanovna now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>Darya Alexandrovna, sitting erect on a chair, turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) head, following Anna with a face of sympathetic suffering.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to make the attempt,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said softly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose I make the attempt.
<p/>What does it mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said, evidently giving utterance to a thought, a thousand times thought over and learned by heart.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It means that I, hating him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>), but still recognizing that I have wronged him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)--and I consider him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) magnanimous--that I humiliate myself to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)....  Well, suppose I make the effort; I do it.
<p/>Either I receive a humiliating refusal or consent....  Well, I have received his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) consent, say...''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>Anna was at that moment at the furthest end of the room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stopped there, doing something to the curtain at the window.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I receive his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) consent, but my...my son?
<p/>They won't give him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) up to me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) will grow up despising me, with his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) father, whom I've abandoned.
<p/>Do you see, I love... equally, I think, but both more than myself--two creatures, Seryozha and Alexey.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) came out into the middle of the room and stood facing Dolly, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) arms pressed tightly across her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) chest.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) white dressing gown her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) figure seemed more than usually grand and broad.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) head, and with shining, wet eyes looked from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) brows at Dolly, a thin little pitiful figure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) patched dressing jacket and nightcap, shaking all over with emotion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only those two creatures that I love, and one excludes the other.
<p/>I can't have them together, and that's the only thing I want.
<p/>And since I can't have that, I don't care about the rest.
<p/>I don't care about anything, anything.
<p/>And it will end one way or another, and so I can't, I don't like to talk of it.
<p/>So don't blame me, don't judge me for anything.
<p/>You can't with your pure heart understand all that I'm suffering.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) went up, sat down beside Dolly, and with a guilty look, peeped into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) face and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you thinking?
<p/>What are you thinking about me?
<p/>Don't despise me.
<p/>I don't deserve contempt.
<p/>I'm simply unhappy.
<p/>If anyone is unhappy, I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) articulated, and turning away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) burst into tears.
<p/>Left alone, Darya Alexandrovna said her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) prayers and went to bed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had felt for Anna with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) heart while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) could not force herself to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/>The memories of home and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) children rose up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) imagination with a peculiar charm quite new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), with a sort of new brilliance.
<p/>That world of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) own seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) now so sweet and precious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) would not on any account spend an extra day outside it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) would certainly go back next day.
<p/>Anna meantime went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) boudoir, took a wine glass and dropped into it several drops of a medicine, of which the principal ingredient was morphine.
<p/>After drinking it off and sitting still a little while, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bedroom in a soothed and more cheerful frame of mind.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went into the bedroom, Vronsky looked intently at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was looking for traces of the conversation which he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that, staying so long in Dolly's room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) must have had with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/>But in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) expression of restrained excitement, and of a sort of reserve, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could find nothing but the beauty that always bewitched him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) afresh though he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was used to it, the consciousness of it, and the desire that it should affect him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not want to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) what they had been talking of, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hoped that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) own accord.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) only said:  <div class="bookquote">``I am so glad you like Dolly.
<p/>You do, don't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I've known her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) a long while, you know.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)'s very good-hearted, I suppose,  mais excessivement terre-√†-terre.
<p/>Still, I'm very glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) took Anna's hand and looked inquiringly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Misinterpreting the look, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) smiled to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Next morning, in spite of the protests of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hosts, Darya Alexandrovna prepared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) homeward journey.
<p/>Levin's coachman, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) by no means new coat and shabby hat, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ill-matched horses and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) coach with the patched mud-guards, drove with gloomy determination into the covered gravel approach.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna disliked taking leave of Princess Varvara and the gentlemen of the party.
<p/>After a day spent together, both she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hosts were distinctly aware that they did not get on together, and that it was better for them not to meet.
<p/>Only Anna was sad.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that now, from Dolly's departure, no one again would stir up within her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soul the feelings that had been roused by their conversation.
<p/>It hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to stir up these feelings, but yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that that was the best part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soul, and that that part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soul would quickly be smothered in the life she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was leading.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) drove out into the open country, Darya Alexandrovna had a delightful sense of relief, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt tempted to ask the two men how they had liked being at Vronsky's, when suddenly the coachman, Philip, expressed himself unasked:  <div class="bookquote">``Rolling in wealth they may be, but three pots of oats was all they gave us.
<p/>Everything cleared up till there wasn't a grain left by cockcrow.
<p/>What are three pots?
<p/>A mere mouthful!
<p/>And oats now down to forty-five kopecks.
<p/>At our place, no fear, all comers may have as much as they can eat.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Philip</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The master's a screw,''  (<font color='red'><b>the house clerk</b></font>)</div>put in the counting house clerk.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, did you like their horses?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The horses!--there's no two opinions about them.
<p/>And the food was good.
<p/>But it seemed to me sort of dreary there, Darya Alexandrovna.
<p/>I don't know what you thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) handsome, good-natured face to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought so too.
<p/>Well, shall we get home by evening?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, we must!''
 (<font color='red'><b>home everyone</b></font>)</div><p/>On reaching home and finding everyone entirely satisfactory and particularly charming, Darya Alexandrovna began with great liveliness telling them how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had arrived, how warmly they had received her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), of the luxury and good taste in which the Vronskys lived, and of their recreations, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) would not allow a word to be said against them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One has to know Anna and Vronsky--I have got to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) better now--to see how nice they are, and how touching,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, speaking now with perfect sincerity, and forgetting the vague feeling of dissatisfaction and awkwardness she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had experienced there.
<p/>Chapter 25   Vronsky and Anna spent the whole summer and part of the winter in the country, living in just the same condition, and still taking no steps to obtain a divorce.
<p/>It was an understood thing between them that they should not go away anywhere; but both felt, the longer they lived alone, especially in the autumn, without guests in the house, that they could not stand this existence, and that they would have to alter it.
<p/>Their life was apparently such that nothing better could be desired.
<p/>They had the fullest abundance of everything; they had a child, and both had occupation.
<p/>Anna devoted just as much care to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) appearance when they had no visitors, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did a great deal of reading, both of novels and of what serious literature was in fashion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ordered all the books that were praised in the foreign papers and reviews she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) received, and read them with that concentrated attention which is only given to what is read in seclusion.
<p/>Moreover, every subject that was of interest to Vronsky, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) studied in books and special journals, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) often went straight to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with questions relating to agriculture or architecture, sometimes even with questions relating to horse-breeding or sport.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was amazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knowledge, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) memory, and at first was disposed to doubt it, to ask for confirmation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) facts; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would find what he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked for in some book, and show it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>The building of the hospital, too, interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not merely assist, but planned and suggested a great deal herself.
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) chief thought was still of herself--how far she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was dear to Vronsky, how far she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could make up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) for all he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had given up.
<p/>Vronsky appreciated this desire not only to please, but to serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), which had become the sole aim of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) existence, but at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) wearied of the loving snares in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tried to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) fast.
<p/>As time went on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) saw himself more and more often held fast in these snares, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had an ever growing desire, not so much to escape from them, as to try whether they hindered his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) freedom.
<p/>Had it not been for this growing desire to be free, not to have scenes every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) wanted to go to the town to a meeting or a race, Vronsky would have been perfectly satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) life.
<p/>The r√¥le he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had taken up, the r√¥le of a wealthy landowner, one of that class which ought to be the very heart of the Russian aristocracy, was entirely to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) taste; and now, after spending six months in that character, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) derived even greater satisfaction from it.
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) management of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) estate, which occupied and absorbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) more and more, was most successful.
<p/>In spite of the immense sums cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) by the hospital, by machinery, by cows ordered from Switzerland, and many other things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was not wasting, but increasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) substance.
<p/>In all matters affecting income, the sales of timber, wheat, and wool, the letting of lands, Vronsky was hard as a rock, and knew well how to keep up prices.
<p/>In all operations on a large scale on this and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) other estates, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) kept to the simplest methods involving no risk, and in trifling details he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was careful and exacting to an extreme degree.
<p/>In spite of all the cunning and ingenuity of the German steward, who would try to tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) into purchases by making his (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) original estimate always far larger than really required, and then representing to Vronsky that he (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) might get the thing cheaper, and so make a profit, Vronsky did not give in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) steward, cross-examined him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), and only agreed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) suggestions when the implement to be ordered or constructed was the very newest, not yet known in Russia, and likely to excite wonder.
<p/>Apart from such exceptions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) resolved upon an increased outlay only where there was a surplus, and in making such an outlay he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) went into the minutest details, and insisted on getting the very best for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) money; so that by the method on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) managed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) affairs, it was clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) was not wasting, but increasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) substance.
<p/>In October there were the provincial elections in the Kashinsky province, where were the estates of Vronsky, Sviazhsky, Koznishev, Oblonsky, and a small part of Levin's land.
<p/>These elections were attracting public attention from several circumstances connected with them, and also from the people taking part in them.
<p/>There had been a great deal of talk about them, and great preparations were being made for them.
<p/>Persons who never attended the elections were coming from Moscow, from Petersburg, and from abroad to attend these.
<p/>Vronsky had long before promised Sviazhsky to go to them.
<p/>Before the elections Sviazhsky, who often visited Vozdvizhenskoe, drove over to fetch Vronsky.
<p/>On the day before there had been almost a quarrel between Vronsky and Anna over this proposed expedition.
<p/>It was the very dullest autumn weather, which is so dreary in the country, and so, preparing himself for a struggle, Vronsky, with a hard and cold expression, informed Anna of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>) departure as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>) had never spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) before.
<p/>But, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>) surprise, Anna accepted the information with great composure, and merely asked when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>) would be back.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>) looked intently at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), at a loss to explain this composure.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) smiled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>) look.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>) knew that way she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had of withdrawing into herself, and knew that it only happened when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had determined upon something without letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>) know her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) plans.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>) was afraid of this; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>) was so anxious to avoid a scene that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>) kept up appearances, and half sincerely believed in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>) longed to believe in--her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) reasonableness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you won't be dull?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I got a box of books yesterday from Gautier's.
<p/>No, I shan't be dull.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)'s trying to take that tone, and so much the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``or else it would be the same thing over and over again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>) set off for the elections without appealing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) for a candid explanation.
<p/>It was the first time since the beginning of their intimacy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>) had parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) without a full explanation.
<p/>From one point of view this troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>), but on the other side he (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>) felt that it was better so.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At first there will be, as this time, something undefined kept back, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) will get used to it.
<p/>In any case I can give up anything for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), but not my masculine independence,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sviazhsky</b></font>) thought.
<p/>Chapter 26   In September Levin moved to Moscow for Kitty's confinement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had spent a whole month in Moscow with nothing to do, when Sergey Ivanovitch, who had property in the Kashinsky province, and took great interest in the question of the approaching elections, made ready to set off to the elections.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) invited his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother, who had a vote in the Seleznevsky district, to come with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Levin had, moreover, to transact in Kashin some extremely important business relating to the wardship of land and to the receiving of certain redemption money for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sister, who was abroad.
<p/>Levin still hesitated, but Kitty, who saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was bored in Moscow, and urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to go, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) own authority ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) the proper nobleman's uniform, costing seven pounds.
<p/>And that seven pounds paid for the uniform was the chief cause that finally decided Levin to go.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went to Kashin....  Levin had been six days in Kashin, visiting the assembly each day, and busily engaged about his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sister's business, which still dragged on.
<p/>The district marshals of nobility were all occupied with the elections, and it was impossible to get the simplest thing done that depended upon the court of wardship.
<p/>The other matter, the payment of the sums due, was met too by difficulties.
<p/>After long negotiations over the legal details, the money was at last ready to be paid; but the notary, a most obliging person, could not hand over the order, because it must have the signature of the president, and the president, though he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) had not given over his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) duties to a deputy, was at the elections.
<p/>All these worrying negotiations, this endless going from place to place, and talking with pleasant and excellent people, who quite saw the unpleasantness of the petitioner's position, but were powerless to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>petitioner</b></font>)--all these efforts that yielded no result, led to a feeling of misery in Levin akin to the mortifying helplessness one experiences in dreams when one tries to use physical force.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt this frequently as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) talked to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) most good-natured solicitor.
<p/>This solicitor did, it seemed, everything possible, and strained every nerve to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) difficulties.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you what you might try,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said more than once; <div class="bookquote">``go to so-and-so and so-and-so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the solicitor drew up a regular plan for getting round the fatal point that hindered everything.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>solicitor</b></font>) would add immediately, <div class="bookquote">``It'll mean some delay, anyway, but you might try it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And Levin did try, and did go.
<p/>Everyone was kind and civil, but the point evaded seemed to crop up again in the end, and again to bar the way.
<p/>What was particularly trying, was that Levin could not make out with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was struggling, to whose interest it was that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) business should not be done.
<p/>That no one seemed to know; the solicitor certainly did not know.
<p/>If Levin could have understood why, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw why one can only approach the booking office of a railway station in single file, it would not have been so vexatious and tiresome to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>But with the hindrances that confronted him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) business, no one could explain why they existed.
<p/>But Levin had changed a good deal since his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) marriage; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was patient, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not see why it was all arranged like this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) told himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not judge without knowing all about it, and that most likely it must be so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tried not to fret.
<p/>In attending the elections, too, and taking part in them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tried now not to judge, not to fall foul of them, but to comprehend as fully as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could the question which was so earnestly and ardently absorbing honest and excellent men whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) respected.
<p/>Since his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) marriage there had been revealed to Levin so many new and serious aspects of life that had previously, through his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) frivolous attitude to them, seemed of no importance, that in the question of the elections too he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) assumed and tried to find some serious significance.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) the meaning and object of the proposed revolution at the elections.
<p/>The marshal of the province in whose hands the law had placed the control of so many important public functions--the guardianship of wards -LRB-the very department which was giving Levin so much trouble just now-RRB-, the disposal of large sums subscribed by the nobility of the province, the high schools, female, male, and military, and popular instruction on the new model, and finally, the district council--the marshal of the province, Snetkov, was a nobleman of the old school,--dissipating an immense fortune, a good-hearted man, honest after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own fashion, but utterly without any comprehension of the needs of modern days.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always took, in every question, the side of the nobility; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was positively antagonistic to the spread of popular education, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) succeeded in giving a purely party character to the district council which ought by rights to be of such an immense importance.
<p/>What was needed was to put in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place a fresh, capable, perfectly modern man, of contemporary ideas, and to frame their policy so as from the rights conferred upon the nobles, not as the nobility, but as an element of the district council, to extract all the powers of self-government that could possibly be derived from them.
<p/>In the wealthy Kashinsky province, which always took the lead of other provinces in everything, there was now such a preponderance of forces that this policy, once carried through properly there, might serve as a model for other provinces for all Russia.
<p/>And hence the whole question was of the greatest importance.
<p/>It was proposed to elect as marshal in place of Snetkov either Sviazhsky, or, better still, Nevyedovsky, a former university professor, a man of remarkable intelligence and a great friend of Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/>The meeting was opened by the governor, who made a speech to the nobles, urging them to elect the public functionaries, not from regard for persons, but for the service and welfare of their fatherland, and hoping that the honorable nobility of the Kashinsky province would, as at all former elections, hold their duty as sacred, and vindicate the exalted confidence of the monarch.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) had finished with his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) speech, the governor walked out of the hall, and the noblemen noisily and eagerly--some even enthusiastically--followed him (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) and thronged round him (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) fur coat and conversed amicably with the marshal of the province.
<p/>Levin, anxious to see into everything and not to miss anything, stood there too in the crowd, and heard the governor say: <div class="bookquote">``Please tell Marya Ivanovna my wife is very sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) couldn't come to the Home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the governor</b></font>)</div><p/>And thereupon the nobles in high good-humor sorted out their fur coats and all drove off to the cathedral.
<p/>In the cathedral Levin, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand like the rest and repeating the words of the archdeacon, swore with most terrible oaths to do all the governor had hoped they would do.
<p/>Church services always affected Levin, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) uttered the words <div class="bookquote">``I kiss the cross,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and glanced round at the crowd of young and old men repeating the same, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt touched.
<p/>On the second and third days there was business relating to the finances of the nobility and the female high school, of no importance whatever, as Sergey Ivanovitch explained, and Levin, busy seeing after his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own affairs, did not attend the meetings.
<p/>On the fourth day the auditing of the marshal's accounts took place at the high table of the marshal of the province.
<p/>And then there occurred the first skirmish between the new party and the old.
<p/>The committee who had been deputed to verify the accounts reported to the meeting that all was in order.
<p/>The marshal of the province got up, thanked the nobility for their confidence, and shed tears.
<p/>The nobles gave him (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) a loud welcome, and shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>).
<p/>But at that instant a nobleman of Sergey Ivanovitch's party said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had heard that the committee had not verified the accounts, considering such a verification an insult to the marshal of the province.
<p/>One of the members of the committee incautiously admitted this.
<p/>Then a small gentleman, very young-looking but very malignant, began to say that it would probably be agreeable to the marshal of the province to give an account of his (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) expenditures of the public moneys, and that the misplaced delicacy of the members of the committee was depriving him (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) of this moral satisfaction.
<p/>Then the members of the committee tried to withdraw their admission, and Sergey Ivanovitch began to prove that they must logically admit either that they had verified the accounts or that they had not, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) developed this dilemma in detail.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch was answered by the spokesman of the opposite party.
<p/>Then Sviazhsky spoke, and then the malignant gentleman again.
<p/>The discussion lasted a long time and ended in nothing.
<p/>Levin was surprised that they should dispute upon this subject so long, especially as, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) asked Sergey Ivanovitch whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) supposed that money had been misappropriated, Sergey Ivanovitch answered:  <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>)'s an honest man.
<p/>But those old-fashioned methods of paternal family arrangements in the management of provincial affairs must be broken down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>On the fifth day came the elections of the district marshals.
<p/>It was rather a stormy day in several districts.
<p/>In the Seleznevsky district Sviazhsky was elected unanimously without a ballot, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) gave a dinner that evening.
<p/>Chapter 27   The sixth day was fixed for the election of the marshal of the province.
<p/>The rooms, large and small, were full of noblemen in all sorts of uniforms.
<p/>Many had come only for that day.
<p/>Men who had not seen each other for years, some from the Crimea, some from Petersburg, some from abroad, met in the rooms of the Hall of Nobility.
<p/>There was much discussion around the governor's table under the portrait of the Tsar.
<p/>The nobles, both in the larger and the smaller rooms, grouped themselves in camps, and from their hostile and suspicious glances, from the silence that fell upon them when outsiders approached a group, and from the way that some, whispering together, retreated to the farther corridor, it was evident that each side had secrets from the other.
<p/>In appearance the noblemen were sharply divided into two classes: the old and the new.
<p/>The old were for the most part either in old uniforms of the nobility, buttoned up closely, with spurs and hats, or in their own special naval, cavalry, infantry, or official uniforms.
<p/>The uniforms of the older men were embroidered in the old-fashioned way with epaulets on their shoulders; they were unmistakably tight and short in the waist, as though their wearers had grown out of them.
<p/>The younger men wore the uniform of the nobility with long waists and broad shoulders, unbuttoned over white waistcoats, or uniforms with black collars and with the embroidered badges of justices of the peace.
<p/>To the younger men belonged the court uniforms that here and there brightened up the crowd.
<p/>But the division into young and old did not correspond with the division of parties.
<p/>Some of the young men, as Levin observed, belonged to the old party; and some of the very oldest noblemen, on the contrary, were whispering with Sviazhsky, and were evidently ardent partisans of the new party.
<p/>Levin stood in the smaller room, where they were smoking and taking light refreshments, close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own friends, and listening to what they were saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) conscientiously exerted all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) intelligence trying to understand what was said.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch was the center round which the others grouped themselves.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was listening at that moment to Sviazhsky and Hliustov, the marshal of another district, who belonged to their party.
<p/>Hliustov would not agree to go with his (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) district to ask Snetkov to stand, while Sviazhsky was persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) to do so, and Sergey Ivanovitch was approving of the plan.
<p/>Levin could not make out why the opposition was to ask the marshal to stand whom they wanted to supersede.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had just been drinking and taking some lunch, came up to them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) uniform of a gentleman of the bedchamber, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lips with a perfumed handkerchief of bordered batiste.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are placing our forces,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, pulling out his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) whiskers, <div class="bookquote">``Sergey Ivanovitch!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And listening to the conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) supported Sviazhsky's contention.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One district's enough, and Sviazhsky's obviously of the opposition,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, words evidently intelligible to all except Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Kostya, you here too!
<p/>I suppose you're converted, eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) added, turning to Levin and drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arm through his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Levin would have been glad indeed to be converted, but could not make out what the point was, and retreating a few steps from the speakers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) explained to Stepan Arkadyevitch his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) inability to understand why the marshal of the province should be asked to stand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O sancta simplicitas!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and briefly and clearly he (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) explained it to Levin.
<p/>If, as at previous elections, all the districts asked the marshal of the province to stand, then he (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) would be elected without a ballot.
<p/>That must not be.
<p/>Now eight districts had agreed to call upon him (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>): if two refused to do so, Snetkov might decline to stand at all; and then the old party might choose another of their party, which would throw them completely out in their reckoning.
<p/>But if only one district, Sviazhsky's, did not call upon him (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) to stand, Snetkov would let himself be balloted for.
<p/>They were even, some of them, going to vote for him (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>), and purposely to let him (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) get a good many votes, so that the enemy might be thrown off the scent, and when a candidate of the other side was put up, they too might give him (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) some votes.
<p/>Levin understood to some extent, but not fully, and would have put a few more questions, when suddenly everyone began talking and making a noise and they moved towards the big room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?
<p/>eh?
<p/>whom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No guarantee?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The law!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin heard exclamations on all sides, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) moved into the big room together with the others, all hurrying somewhere and afraid of missing something.
<p/>Squeezed by the crowding noblemen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drew near the high table where the marshal of the province, Sviazhsky, and the other leaders were hotly disputing about something.
<p/>Chapter 28   Levin was standing rather far off.
<p/>A nobleman breathing heavily and hoarsely at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) side, and another whose thick boots were creaking, prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) from hearing distinctly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could only hear the soft voice of the marshal faintly, then the shrill voice of the malignant gentleman, and then the voice of Sviazhsky.
<p/>They were disputing, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could make out, as to the interpretation to be put on the act and the exact meaning of the words: <div class="bookquote">``liable to be called up for trial.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The crowd parted to make way for Sergey Ivanovitch approaching the table.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till the malignant gentleman had finished speaking, said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) thought the best solution would be to refer to the act itself, and asked the secretary to find the act.
<p/>The act said that in case of difference of opinion, there must be a ballot.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch read the act and began to explain its meaning, but at that point a tall, stout, round-shouldered landowner, with dyed whiskers, in a tight uniform that cut the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) neck, interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) went up to the table, and striking it with his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) finger ring, he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) shouted loudly: <div class="bookquote">``A ballot!
<p/>Put it to the vote!
<p/>No need for more talking!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then several voices began to talk all at once, and the tall nobleman with the ring, getting more and more exasperated, shouted more and more loudly.
<p/>But it was impossible to make out what he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) said.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) was shouting for the very course Sergey Ivanovitch had proposed; but it was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) party, and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it the same vindictiveness, though in a more seemly form, on the other side.
<p/>Shouts were raised, and for a moment all was confusion, so that the marshal of the province had to call for order.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A ballot!
<p/>A ballot!
<p/>Every nobleman sees it!
<p/>We shed our blood for our country!...
<p/>The confidence of the monarch....  No checking the accounts of the marshal; he (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>)'s not a cashier....
<p/>But that's not the point....
<p/>Votes, please!
<p/>Beastly!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>shouted furious and violent voices on all sides.
<p/>Looks and faces were even more violent and furious than their words.
<p/>They expressed the most implacable hatred.
<p/>Levin did not in the least understand what was the matter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about Flerov should be put to the vote.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) forgot, as Sergey Ivanovitch explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) afterwards, this syllogism: that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province; that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes; that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure Flerov's right to vote; that to secure the recognition of Flerov's right to vote they must decide on the interpretation to be put on the act.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And one vote may decide the whole question, and one must be serious and consecutive, if one wants to be of use in public life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>concluded Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/>But Levin forgot all that, and it was painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to see all these excellent persons, for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had a respect, in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement.
<p/>To escape from this painful feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment bar.
<p/>Seeing the waiters busy over washing up the crockery and setting in order their plates and wine glasses, seeing their calm and cheerful faces, Levin felt an unexpected sense of relief as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had come out of a stuffy room into the fresh air.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began walking up and down, looking with pleasure at the waiters.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) particularly liked the way one gray-whiskered waiter, who showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered at by them, was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly.
<p/>Levin was just about to enter into conversation with the old waiter, when the secretary of the court of wardship, a little old man whose specialty it was to know all the noblemen of the province by name and patronymic, drew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please come, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``your brother's looking for you.
<p/>They are voting on the legal point.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin walked into the room, received a white ball, and followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, Sergey Ivanovitch, to the table where Sviazhsky was standing with a significant and ironical face, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) beard in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fist and sniffing at it.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch put his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) hand into the box, put the ball somewhere, and making room for Levin, stopped.
<p/>Levin advanced, but utterly forgetting what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was to do, and much embarrassed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) turned to Sergey Ivanovitch with the question, <div class="bookquote">``Where am I to put it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) asked this softly, at a moment when there was talking going on near, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had hoped his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) question would not be overheard.
<p/>But the persons speaking paused, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) improper question was overheard.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch frowned.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a matter for each man's own decision,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) said severely.
<p/>Several people smiled.
<p/>Levin crimsoned, hurriedly thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand under the cloth, and put the ball to the right as it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) right hand.
<p/>Having put it in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) recollected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ought to have thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) left hand too, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thrust it in though too late, and, still more overcome with confusion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) beat a hasty retreat into the background.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A hundred and twenty-six for admission!
<p/>Ninety-eight against!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the secretary</b></font>)</div><p/>sang out the voice of the secretary, who could not pronounce the letter  r .
<p/>Then there was a laugh; a button and two nuts were found in the box.
<p/>The nobleman was allowed the right to vote, and the new party had conquered.
<p/>But the old party did not consider themselves conquered.
<p/>Levin heard that they were asking Snetkov to stand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw that a crowd of noblemen was surrounding the marshal, who was saying something.
<p/>Levin went nearer.
<p/>In reply Snetkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), the affection they had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not deserve, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) only merit had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) attachment to the nobility, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had devoted twelve years of service.
<p/>Several times he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) repeated the words: <div class="bookquote">``I have served to the best of my powers with truth and good faith, I value your goodness and thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stopped short from the tears that choked him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and went out of the room.
<p/>Whether these tears came from a sense of the injustice being done him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) love for the nobility, or from the strain of the position he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was placed in, feeling himself surrounded by enemies, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) emotion infected the assembly, the majority were touched, and Levin felt a tenderness for Snetkov.
<p/>In the doorway the marshal of the province jostled against Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beg pardon, excuse me, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said as to a stranger, but recognizing Levin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) smiled timidly.
<p/>It seemed to Levin that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would have liked to say something, but could not speak for emotion.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) whole figure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) uniform with the crosses, and white trousers striped with braid, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) moved hurriedly along, reminded Levin of some hunted beast who sees that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) is in evil case.
<p/>This expression in the marshal's face was particularly touching to Levin, because, only the day before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) house about his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) trustee business and had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) grandeur, a kind-hearted, fatherly man.
<p/>The big house with the old family furniture; the rather dirty, far from stylish, but respectful footmen, unmistakably old house serfs who had stuck to their master; the stout, good-natured wife in a cap with lace and a Turkish shawl, petting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pretty grandchild, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughter's daughter; the young son, a sixth form high school boy, coming home from school, and greeting his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) big hand; the genuine, cordial words and gestures of the old man--all this had the day before roused an instinctive feeling of respect and sympathy in Levin.
<p/>This old man was a touching and pathetic figure to Levin now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) longed to say something pleasant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you're sure to be our marshal again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marshal</b></font>)</div>said the marshal, looking round with a scared expression.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm worn out, I'm old.
<p/>If there are men younger and more deserving than I, let them serve.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the marshal</b></font>)</div><p/>And the marshal disappeared through a side door.
<p/>The most solemn moment was at hand.
<p/>They were to proceed immediately to the election.
<p/>The leaders of both parties were reckoning white and black on their fingers.
<p/>The discussion upon Flerov had given the new party not only Flerov's vote, but had also gained time for them, so that they could send to fetch three noblemen who had been rendered unable to take part in the elections by the wiles of the other party.
<p/>Two noble gentlemen, who had a weakness for strong drink, had been made drunk by the partisans of Snetkov, and a third had been robbed of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) uniform.
<p/>On learning this, the new party had made haste, during the dispute about Flerov, to send some of their men in a sledge to clothe the stripped gentleman, and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've brought one, drenched him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with water,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landowner</b></font>)</div>said the landowner, who had gone on this errand, to Sviazhsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>)'s all right?
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>)'ll do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not too drunk, he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) won't fall down?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Sviazhsky, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>)'s first-rate.
<p/>If only they don't give him (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) any more here....
<p/>I've told the waiter not to give him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) anything on any account.''
 (<font color='red'><b>noblemen</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 29   The narrow room, in which they were smoking and taking refreshments, was full of noblemen.
<p/>The excitement grew more intense, and every face betrayed some uneasiness.
<p/>The excitement was specially keen for the leaders of each party, who knew every detail, and had reckoned up every vote.
<p/>They were the generals organizing the approaching battle.
<p/>The rest, like the rank and file before an engagement, though they were getting ready for the fight, sought for other distractions in the interval.
<p/>Some were lunching, standing at the bar, or sitting at the table; others were walking up and down the long room, smoking cigarettes, and talking with friends whom they had not seen for a long while.
<p/>Levin did not care to eat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not smoking; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not want to join his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own friends, that is Sergey Ivanovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch, Sviazhsky and the rest, because Vronsky in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) equerry's uniform was standing with them in eager conversation.
<p/>Levin had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) already at the meeting on the previous day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had studiously avoided him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), not caring to greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went to the window and sat down, scanning the groups, and listening to what was being said around him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt depressed, especially because everyone else was, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw, eager, anxious, and interested, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) alone, with an old, toothless little man with mumbling lips wearing a naval uniform, sitting beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), had no interest in it and nothing to do.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s such a blackguard!
<p/>I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so, but it makes no difference.
<p/>Only think of it!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't collect it in three years!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard vigorously uttered by a round-shouldered, short, country gentleman, who had pomaded hair hanging on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) embroidered collar, and new boots obviously put on for the occasion, with heels that tapped energetically as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke.
<p/>Casting a displeased glance at Levin, this gentleman sharply turned his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's a dirty business, there's no denying,''  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>a small gentleman assented in a high voice.
<p/>Next, a whole crowd of country gentlemen, surrounding a stout general, hurriedly came near Levin.
<p/>These persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How dare he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) say I had his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) breeches stolen!
<p/>Pawned them for drink, I expect.
<p/>Damn the fellow, prince indeed!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>)'d better not say it, the beast!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But excuse me!
<p/>They take their stand on the act,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was being said in another group; <div class="bookquote">``the wife must be registered as noble.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, damn your acts!
<p/>I speak from my heart.
<p/>We're all gentlemen, aren't we?
<p/>Above suspicion.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we go on, your excellency,  fine champagne? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>a nobleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Another group was following a nobleman, who was shouting something in a loud voice; it was one of the three intoxicated gentlemen.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always advised Marya Semyonovna to let for a fair rent, for she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) can never save a profit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) heard a pleasant voice say.
<p/>The speaker was a country gentleman with gray whiskers, wearing the regimental uniform of an old general staff-officer.
<p/>It was the very landowner Levin had met at Sviazhsky's.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) at once.
<p/>The landowner too stared at Levin, and they exchanged greetings.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very glad to see you!
<p/>To be sure!
<p/>I remember you very well.
<p/>Last year at our district marshal, Nikolay Ivanovitch's.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and how is your land doing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, still just the same, always at a loss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landowner</b></font>)</div>the landowner answered with a resigned smile, but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do you come to be in our province?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come to take part in our  coup d'etat? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) said, confidently pronouncing the French words with a bad accent.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All Russia's here--gentlemen of the bedchamber, and everything short of the ministry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) pointed to the imposing figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch in white trousers and his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) court uniform, walking by with a general.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to own that I don't very well understand the drift of the provincial elections,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/>The landowner looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what is there to understand?
<p/>There's no meaning in it at all.
<p/>It's a decaying institution that goes on running only by the force of inertia.
<p/>Just look, the very uniforms tell you that it's an assembly of justices of the peace, permanent members of the court, and so on, but not of noblemen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do you come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``From habit, nothing else.
<p/>Then, too, one must keep up connections.
<p/>It's a moral obligation of a sort.
<p/>And then, to tell the truth, there's one's own interests.
<p/>My son-in-law wants to stand as a permanent member; they're not rich people, and he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) must be brought forward.
<p/>These gentlemen, now, what do they come for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) said, pointing to the malignant gentleman, who was talking at the high table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the new generation of nobility.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``New it may be, but nobility it isn't.
<p/>They're proprietors of a sort, but we're the landowners.
<p/>As noblemen, they're cutting their own throats.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you say it's an institution that's served its time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That it may be, but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully.

Old and gnarled it may be, and yet you don't cut down the old fellow to make room for the flowerbeds, but lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree.
<p/>You won't grow him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) again in a year,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said cautiously, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) immediately changed the conversation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and how is your land doing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not very well.
<p/>I make five per cent.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but you don't reckon your own work.
<p/>Aren't you worth something too?
<p/>I'll tell you my own case.

<p/>Now I do more work than I did in the service, and like you I get five per cent.
<p/>on the land, and thank God for that.
<p/>But one's work is thrown in for nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do you do it, if it's a clear loss?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, one does it!
<p/>What would you have?
<p/>It's habit, and one knows it's how it should be.
<p/>And what's more,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landowner</b></font>)</div>the landowner went on, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) elbows on the window and chatting on, <div class="bookquote">``my son, I must tell you, has no taste for it.
<p/>There's no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'ll be a scientific man.
<p/>So there'll be no one to keep it up.

<p/>Here this year I've planted an orchard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the landowner</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, <div class="bookquote">``that's perfectly true.
<p/>I always feel there's no real balance of gain in my work on the land, and yet one does it....
<p/>It's a sort of duty one feels to the land.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I tell you what,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landowner neighbor</b></font>)</div>the landowner pursued; <div class="bookquote">``a neighbor of mine, a merchant, was at my place.
<p/>We walked about the fields and the garden.
<p/>`No,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>), `Stepan Vassilievitch, everything's well looked after, but your garden's neglected.'
<p/>But, as a fact, it's well kept up.
<p/>`To my thinking, I'd cut down that lime-tree.
<p/>Here you've thousands of limes, and each would make two good bundles of bark.
<p/>And nowadays that bark's worth something.
<p/>I'd cut down the lot.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>the landowner neighbor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And with what he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) made he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>)'d increase his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) stock, or buy some land for a trifle, and let it out in lots to the peasants,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin added, smiling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had evidently more than once come across those commercial calculations.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'d make his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fortune.

 (<font color='red'><b>the landowner</b></font>)</div><p/>said the landowner.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin answered, with proud satisfaction.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's rather strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So we live without making anything, as though we were ancient vestals set to keep in a fire.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The landowner</b></font>)</div><p/>The landowner chuckled under his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) white mustaches.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are some among us, too, like our friend Nikolay Ivanovitch, or Count Vronsky, that's settled here lately, who try to carry on their husbandry as though it were a factory; but so far it leads to nothing but making away with capital on it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why is it we don't do like the merchants?
<p/>Why don't we cut down our parks for timber?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, returning to a thought that had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, as you said, to keep the fire in.
<p/>Besides that's not work for a nobleman.
<p/>And our work as noblemen isn't done here at the elections, but yonder, each in our corner.
<p/>There's a class instinct, too, of what one ought and oughtn't to do.
<p/>There's the peasants, too, I wonder at them sometimes; any good peasant tries to take all the land he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) can.
<p/>However bad the land is, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>)'ll work it.
<p/>Without a return too.
<p/>At a simple loss.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as we do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very, very glad to have met you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) added, seeing Sviazhsky approaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And here we've met for the first time since we met at your place,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landowner</b></font>)</div>said the landowner to Sviazhsky, <div class="bookquote">``and we've had a good talk too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, have you been attacking the new order of things?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Sviazhsky with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That we're bound to do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've relieved your feelings?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 30   Sviazhsky took Levin's arm, and went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own friends.
<p/>This time there was no avoiding Vronsky.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was standing with Stepan Arkadyevitch and Sergey Ivanovitch, and looking straight at Levin as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drew near.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Delighted!
<p/>I believe I've had the pleasure of meeting you...at Princess Shtcherbatskaya's,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, giving Levin his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I quite remember our meeting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, and blushing crimson, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) turned away immediately, and began talking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother.
<p/>With a slight smile Vronsky went on talking to Sviazhsky, obviously without the slightest inclination to enter into conversation with Levin.
<p/>But Levin, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) talked to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, was continually looking round at Vronsky, trying to think of something to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to gloss over his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) rudeness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are we waiting for now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Levin, looking at Sviazhsky and Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For Snetkov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) has to refuse or to consent to stand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>answered Sviazhsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and what has he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) done, consented or not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the point, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s done neither,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) refuses, who will stand then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Levin, looking at Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whoever chooses to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>said Sviazhsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>said Sviazhsky, looking confused, and turning an alarmed glance at the malignant gentleman, who was standing beside Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who then?
<p/>Nevyedovsky?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) foot into it.
<p/>But this was worse still.
<p/>Nevyedovsky and Sviazhsky were the two candidates.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly shall not, under any circumstances,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>answered the malignant gentleman.
<p/>This was Nevyedovsky himself.
<p/>Sviazhsky introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you find it exciting too?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, winking at Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's something like a race.
<p/>One might bet on it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is keenly exciting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And once taking the thing up, one's eager to see it through.
<p/>It's a fight!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, scowling and setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) powerful jaws.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a capable fellow Sviazhsky is!
<p/>Sees it all so clearly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky assented indifferently.
<p/>A silence followed, during which Vronsky--since he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to look at something--looked at Levin, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) feet, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) uniform, then at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face, and noticing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gloomy eyes fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, in order to say something:  <div class="bookquote">``How is it that you, living constantly in the country, are not a justice of the peace?
<p/>You are not in the uniform of one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's because I consider that the justice of the peace is a silly institution,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin answered gloomily.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been all the time looking for an opportunity to enter into conversation with Vronsky, so as to smooth over his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) rudeness at their first meeting.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think so, quite the contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>Vronsky said, with quiet surprise.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a plaything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) short.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We don't want justices of the peace.
<p/>I've never had a single thing to do with them during eight years.
<p/>And what I have had was decided wrongly by them.
<p/>The justice of the peace is over thirty miles from me.
<p/>For some matter of two roubles I should have to send a lawyer, who costs me fifteen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) related how a peasant had stolen some flour from the miller, and when the miller told him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) of it, had lodged a complaint for slander.
<p/>All this was utterly uncalled for and stupid, and Levin felt it himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, this is such an original fellow!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) most soothing, almond-oil smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But come along; I think they're voting...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And they separated.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, who had observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother's clumsiness, <div class="bookquote">``I can't understand how anyone can be so absolutely devoid of political tact.
<p/>That's where we Russians are so deficient.
<p/>The marshal of the province is our opponent, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) you're  ami cochon , and you beg him (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) to stand.
<p/>Count Vronsky, now ...I'm not making a friend of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s asked me to dinner, and I'm not going; but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s one of our side--why make an enemy of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?
<p/>Then you ask Nevyedovsky if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s going to stand.
<p/>That's not a thing to do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't understand it at all!
<p/>And it's all such nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin answered gloomily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say it's all such nonsense, but as soon as you have anything to do with it, you make a muddle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin did not answer, and they walked together into the big room.
<p/>The marshal of the province, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was vaguely conscious in the air of some trap being prepared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not been called upon by all to stand, had still made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind to stand.
<p/>All was silence in the room.
<p/>The secretary announced in a loud voice that the captain of the guards, Mihail Stepanovitch Snetkov, would now be balloted for as marshal of the province.
<p/>The district marshals walked carrying plates, on which were balls, from their tables to the high table, and the election began.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put it in the right side,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>whispered Stepan Arkadyevitch, as with his (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) brother Levin followed the marshal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) district to the table.
<p/>But Levin had forgotten by now the calculations that had been explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and was afraid Stepan Arkadyevitch might be mistaken in saying <div class="bookquote">``the right side.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Surely Snetkov was the enemy.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) held the ball in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) right hand, but thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was wrong, just at the box he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) changed to the left hand, and undoubtedly put the ball to the left.
<p/>An adept in the business, standing at the box and seeing by the mere action of the elbow where each put his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ball, scowled with annoyance.
<p/>It was no good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) insight.
<p/>Everything was still, and the counting of the balls was heard.
<p/>Then a single voice rose and proclaimed the numbers for and against.
<p/>The marshal had been voted for by a considerable majority.
<p/>All was noise and eager movement towards the doors.
<p/>Snetkov came in, and the nobles thronged round him (<font color='blue'><b>nobles</b></font>), congratulating him (<font color='blue'><b>nobles</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now is it over?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin asked Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only just beginning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sviazhsky/Nikolay Ivanovitch/Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky</b></font>)</div>Sviazhsky said, replying for Sergey Ivanovitch with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some other candidate may receive more votes than the marshal.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin had quite forgotten about that.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could only remember that there was some sort of trickery in it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was too bored to think what it was exactly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt depressed, and longed to get out of the crowd.
<p/>As no one was paying any attention to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and no one apparently needed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) quietly slipped away into the little room where the refreshments were, and again had a great sense of comfort when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw the waiters.
<p/>The little old waiter pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) to have something, and Levin agreed.
<p/>After eating a cutlet with beans and talking to the waiters of their former masters, Levin, not wishing to go back to the hall, where it was all so distasteful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), proceeded to walk through the galleries.
<p/>The galleries were full of fashionably dressed ladies, leaning over the balustrade and trying not to lose a single word of what was being said below.
<p/>With the ladies were sitting and standing smart lawyers, high school teachers in spectacles, and officers.
<p/>Everywhere they were talking of the election, and of how worried the marshal was, and how splendid the discussions had been.
<p/>In one group Levin heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother's praises.
<p/>One lady was telling a lawyer:  <div class="bookquote">``How glad I am I heard Koznishev!
<p/>It's worth losing one's dinner.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>)'s exquisite!
<p/>So clear and distinct all of it!
<p/>There's not one of you in the law courts that speaks like that.
<p/>The only one is Meidel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>)'s not so eloquent by a long way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>Finding a free place, Levin leaned over the balustrade and began looking and listening.
<p/>All the noblemen were sitting railed off behind barriers according to their districts.
<p/>In the middle of the room stood a man in a uniform, who shouted in a loud, high voice:  <div class="bookquote">``As a candidate for the marshalship of the nobility of the province we call upon staff-captain Yevgeney Ivanovitch Apuhtin!''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>A dead silence followed, and then a weak old voice was heard: <div class="bookquote">``Declined!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We call upon the privy councilor Pyotr Petrovitch Bol,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the voice began again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Declined!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>a high boyish voice replied.
<p/>Again it began, and again <div class="bookquote">``Declined.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And so it went on for about an hour.
<p/>Levin, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) elbows on the balustrade, looked and listened.
<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wondered and wanted to know what it meant; then feeling sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not make it out he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began to be bored.
<p/>Then recalling all the excitement and vindictiveness he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had seen on all the faces, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt sad; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind to go, and went downstairs.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) passed through the entry to the galleries he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) met a dejected high school boy walking up and down with tired-looking eyes.
<p/>On the stairs he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) met a couple--a lady running quickly on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) high heels and the jaunty deputy prosecutor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you you weren't late,''  (<font color='red'><b>deputy</b></font>)</div>the deputy prosecutor was saying at the moment when Levin moved aside to let the lady pass.
<p/>Levin was on the stairs to the way out, and was just feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) waistcoat pocket for the number of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) overcoat, when the secretary overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This way, please, Konstantin Dmitrievitch; they are voting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The candidate</b></font>)</div><p/>The candidate who was being voted on was Nevyedovsky, who had so stoutly denied all idea of standing.
<p/>Levin went up to the door of the room; it was locked.
<p/>The secretary knocked, the door opened, and Levin was met by two red-faced gentlemen, who darted out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't stand any more of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>said one red-faced gentleman.
<p/>After them the face of the marshal of the province was poked out.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) face was dreadful-looking from exhaustion and dismay.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you not to let any one out!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) cried to the doorkeeper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I let someone in, your excellency!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy on us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the marshal</b></font>)</div><p/>and with a heavy sigh the marshal of the province walked with downcast head to the high table in the middle of the room, his (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) legs staggering in his (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) white trousers.
<p/>Nevyedovsky had scored a higher majority, as they had planned, and he (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) was the new marshal of the province.
<p/>Many people were amused, many were pleased and happy, many were in ecstasies, many were disgusted and unhappy.
<p/>The former marshal of the province was in a state of despair, which he (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) could not conceal.
<p/>When Nevyedovsky went out of the room, the crowd thronged round him (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) and followed him (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) enthusiastically, just as they had followed the governor who had opened the meetings, and just as they had followed Snetkov when he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) was elected.
<p/>Chapter 31   The newly elected marshal and many of the successful party dined that day with Vronsky.
<p/>Vronsky had come to the elections partly because he (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) was bored in the country and wanted to show Anna his (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) right to independence, and also to repay Sviazhsky by his (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) support at the election for all the trouble he (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) had taken for Vronsky at the district council election, but chiefly in order strictly to perform all those duties of a nobleman and landowner which he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) had taken upon himself.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) had not in the least expected that the election would so interest him (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>), so keenly excite him (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) would be so good at this kind of thing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) was quite a new man in the circle of the nobility of the province, but his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) success was unmistakable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) was not wrong in supposing that he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) had already obtained a certain influence.
<p/>This influence was due to his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) wealth and reputation, the capital house in the town lent him (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) old friend Shirkov, who had a post in the department of finances and was director of a flourishing bank in Kashin; the excellent cook Vronsky had brought from the country, and his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) friendship with the governor, who was a schoolfellow of Vronsky's--a schoolfellow he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) had patronized and protected indeed.
<p/>But what contributed more than all to his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) success was his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) direct, equable manner with everyone, which very quickly made the majority of the noblemen reverse the current opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) supposed haughtiness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) was himself conscious that, except that whimsical gentleman married to Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, who had  √† propos de bottes  poured out a stream of irrelevant absurdities with such spiteful fury, every nobleman with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) had made acquaintance had become his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) adherent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) saw clearly, and other people recognized it, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) had done a great deal to secure the success of Nevyedovsky.
<p/>And now at his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) own table, celebrating Nevyedovsky's election, he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) was experiencing an agreeable sense of triumph over the success of his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) candidate.
<p/>The election itself had so fascinated him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) could succeed in getting married during the next three years, he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) began to think of standing himself--much as after winning a race ridden by a jockey, he (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) had longed to ride a race himself.
<p/>Today he (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) was celebrating the success of his (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) jockey.
<p/>Vronsky sat at the head of the table, on his (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) right hand sat the young governor, a general of high rank.
<p/>To all the rest he (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) was the chief man in the province, who had solemnly opened the elections with his (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) speech, and aroused a feeling of respect and even of awe in many people, as Vronsky saw; to Vronsky he (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) was little Katka Maslov--that had been his (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) nickname in the Pages' Corps--whom he (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) felt to be shy and tried to  mettre √† son aise .
<p/>On the left hand sat Nevyedovsky with his (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) youthful, stubborn, and malignant face.
<p/>With him (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) Vronsky was simple and deferential.
<p/>Sviazhsky took his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) failure very light-heartedly.
<p/>It was indeed no failure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) eyes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) said himself, turning, glass in hand, to Nevyedovsky; they could not have found a better representative of the new movement, which the nobility ought to follow.
<p/>And so every honest person, as he (<font color='blue'><b>representative</b></font>) said, was on the side of today's success and was rejoicing over  it.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch was glad, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>representative</b></font>) was having a good time, and that everyone was pleased.
<p/>The episode of the elections served as a good occasion for a capital dinner.
<p/>Sviazhsky comically imitated the tearful discourse of the marshal, and observed, addressing Nevyedovsky, that his (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) excellency would have to select another more complicated method of auditing the accounts than tears.
<p/>Another nobleman jocosely described how footmen in stockings had been ordered for the marshal's ball, and how now they would have to be sent back unless the new marshal would give a ball with footmen in stockings.
<p/>Continually during dinner they said of Nevyedovsky:  <div class="bookquote">``our marshal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nevyedovsky</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``your excellency.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nevyedovsky</b></font>)</div><p/>This was said with the same pleasure with which a bride is called <div class="bookquote">``Madame''  (<font color='red'><b>a bride</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) husband's name.
<p/>Nevyedovsky affected to be not merely indifferent but scornful of this appellation, but it was obvious that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was highly delighted, and had to keep a curb on himself not to betray the triumph which was unsuitable to their new liberal tone.
<p/>After dinner several telegrams were sent to people interested in the result of the election.
<p/>And Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was in high good humor, sent Darya Alexandrovna a telegram: <div class="bookquote">``Nevyedovsky elected by twenty votes.
<p/>Congratulations.
<p/>Tell people.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darya Alexandrovna/Darya</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dictated it aloud, saying: <div class="bookquote">``We must let them share our rejoicing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Darya Alexandrovna, getting the message, simply sighed over the rouble wasted on it, and understood that it was an after-dinner affair.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) knew Stiva had a weakness after dining for  faire jouer le t√©l√©graphe.
<p/>Everything, together with the excellent dinner and the wine, not from Russian merchants, but imported direct from abroad, was extremely dignified, simple, and enjoyable.
<p/>The party--some twenty--had been selected by Sviazhsky from among the more active new liberals, all of the same way of thinking, who were at the same time clever and well bred.
<p/>They drank, also half in jest, to the health of the new marshal of the province, of the governor, of the bank director, and of <div class="bookquote">``our amiable host.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the bank director</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky was satisfied.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) had never expected to find so pleasant a tone in the provinces.
<p/>Towards the end of dinner it was still more lively.
<p/>The governor asked Vronsky to come to a concert for the benefit of the Servians which his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) wife, who was anxious to make his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) acquaintance, had been getting up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There'll be a ball, and you'll see the belle of the province.
<p/>Worth seeing, really.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in my line,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>Vronsky answered.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) liked that English phrase.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) smiled, and promised to come.
<p/>Before they rose from the table, when all of them were smoking, Vronsky's valet went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) with a letter on a tray.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``From Vozdvizhenskoe by special messenger,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) said with a significant expression.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Astonishing!
<p/>how like he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) is to the deputy prosecutor Sventitsky,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guests</b></font>)</div>said one of the guests in French of the valet, while Vronsky, frowning, read the letter.
<p/>The letter was from Anna.
<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) read the letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) knew its contents.
<p/>Expecting the elections to be over in five days, he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) had promised to be back on Friday.
<p/>Today was Saturday, and he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) knew that the letter contained reproaches for not being back at the time fixed.
<p/>The letter he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) had sent the previous evening had probably not reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) yet.
<p/>The letter was what he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) had expected, but the form of it was unexpected, and particularly disagreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Annie is very ill, the doctor says it may be inflammation.
<p/>I am losing my head all alone.
<p/>Princess Varvara is no help, but a hindrance.
<p/>I expected you the day before yesterday, and yesterday, and now I am sending to find out where you are and what you are doing.
<p/>I wanted to come myself, but thought better of it, knowing you would dislike it.
<p/>Send some answer, that I may know what to do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child ill, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had thought of coming herself.
<p/>Their daughter ill, and this hostile tone.
<p/>The innocent festivities over the election, and this gloomy, burdensome love to which he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had to return struck Vronsky by their contrast.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had to go, and by the first train that night he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) set off home.
<p/>Chapter 32   Before Vronsky's departure for the elections, Anna had reflected that the scenes constantly repeated between them each time he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) left home, might only make him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) cold to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) instead of attaching him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and resolved to do all she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could to control herself so as to bear the parting with composure.
<p/>But the cold, severe glance with which he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) came to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was going had wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and before he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had started her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) peace of mind was destroyed.
<p/>In solitude afterwards, thinking over that glance which had expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) right to freedom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) came, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) always did, to the same point--the sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own humiliation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has the right to go away when and where he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) chooses.
<p/>Not simply to go away, but to leave me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has every right, and I have none.
<p/>But knowing that, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ought not to do it.
<p/>What has he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) done, though?...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) looked at me with a cold, severe expression.
<p/>Of course that is something indefinable, impalpable, but it has never been so before, and that glance means a great deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That glance shows the beginning of indifference.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt sure that a coldness was beginning, there was nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could do, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not in any way alter her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) relations to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
<p/>Just as before, only by love and by charm could she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) keep him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
<p/>And so, just as before, only by occupation in the day, by morphine at night, could she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stifle the fearful thought of what would be if he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ceased to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>It is true there was still one means; not to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)--for that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wanted nothing more than his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) love--but to be nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), to be in such a position that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>That means was divorce and marriage.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) began to long for that, and made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mind to agree to it the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) or Stiva approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) on the subject.
<p/>Absorbed in such thoughts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) passed five days without him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), the five days that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was to be at the elections.
<p/>Walks, conversation with Princess Varvara, visits to the hospital, and, most of all, reading--reading of one book after another--filled up her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) time.
<p/>But on the sixth day, when the coachman came back without him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) felt that now she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was utterly incapable of stifling the thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) and of what he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was doing there, just at that time her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) little girl was taken ill.  Anna began to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), but even that did not distract her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mind, especially as the illness was not serious.
<p/>However hard she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tried, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not love this little child, and to feign love was beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) powers.
<p/>Towards the evening of that day, still alone, Anna was in such a panic about him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) decided to start for the town, but on second thoughts wrote him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) the contradictory letter that Vronsky received, and without reading it through, sent it off by a special messenger.
<p/>The next morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) received his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) letter and regretted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dreaded a repetition of the severe look he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had flung at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) at parting, especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew that the baby was not dangerously ill.
<p/>But still she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had written to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
<p/>At this moment Anna was positively admitting to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was a burden to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would relinquish his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) freedom regretfully to return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and in spite of that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was glad he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was coming.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) weary of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would be here with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would see him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), would know of every action he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) took.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was sitting in the drawing room near a lamp, with a new volume of Taine, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) read, listening to the sound of the wind outside, and every minute expecting the carriage to arrive.
<p/>Several times she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heard the sound of wheels, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been mistaken.
<p/>At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heard not the sound of wheels, but the coachman's shout and the dull rumble in the covered entry.
<p/>Even Princess Varvara, playing patience, confirmed this, and Anna, flushing hotly, got up; but instead of going down, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had done twice before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stood still.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) suddenly felt ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) duplicity, but even more she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dreaded how he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) might meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>All feeling of wounded pride had passed now; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was only afraid of the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) displeasure.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) remembered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) child had been perfectly well again for the last two days.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt positively vexed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) for getting better from the very moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) letter was sent off.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was here, all of him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hands, his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) voice.
<p/>And forgetting everything, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ran joyfully to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how is Annie?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said timidly from below, looking up to Anna as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ran down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was sitting on a chair, and a footman was pulling off his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) warm over-boot.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) said, shaking himself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) hand in both of hers, and drew it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) waist, never taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes off him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) said, coldly scanning her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dress, which he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had put on for him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>).
<p/>All was charming, but how many times it had charmed him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>)!
<p/>And the stern, stony expression that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) so dreaded settled upon his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm glad.
<p/>And are you well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) said, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) damp beard with his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) handkerchief and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``only let him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) be here, and so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>)'s here he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) cannot, he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) dare not, cease to love me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The evening was spent happily and gaily in the presence of Princess Varvara, who complained to him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) that Anna had been taking morphine in his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) absence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to do?
<p/>I couldn't sleep....  My thoughts prevented me.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>)'s here I never take it--hardly ever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) about the election, and Anna knew how by adroit questions to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) to what gave him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) most pleasure--his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) own success.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) of everything that interested him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) at home; and all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) was of the most cheerful description.
<p/>But late in the evening, when they were alone, Anna, seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had regained complete possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>), wanted to erase the painful impression of the glance he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) letter.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said:  <div class="bookquote">``Tell me frankly, you were vexed at getting my letter, and you didn't believe me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had said it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that however warm his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) feelings were to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) had not forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) for that.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the letter was so strange.

(<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But we won't talk about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) voice suddenly changing, <div class="bookquote">``it means that you are sick of this life....

<p/>I am ready to give up my whole life.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you go to Moscow, I will go too.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you know, that's my one desire.
<p/>But for that...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We must get a divorce.

<p/>But I desire nothing so much as never to be parted from you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, smiling.
<p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said these words there gleamed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes not merely a cold look, but the vindictive look of a man persecuted and made cruel.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) saw the look and correctly divined its meaning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If so, it's a calamity!''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>that glance told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>It was a moment's impression, but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never forgot it.
<p/>Anna wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) husband asking him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) about a divorce, and towards the end of November, taking leave of Princess Varvara, who wanted to go to Petersburg, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) went with Vronsky to Moscow.
<p/>Expecting every day an answer from Alexey Alexandrovitch, and after that the divorce, they now established themselves together like married people.
<p/>PART 7    Chapter 1   The Levins had been three months in Moscow.
<p/>The date had long passed on which, according to the most trustworthy calculations of people learned in such matters, Kitty should have been confined.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was still about, and there was nothing to show that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) time was any nearer than two months ago.
<p/>The doctor, the monthly nurse, and Dolly and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) mother, and most of all Levin, who could not think of the approaching event without terror, began to be impatient and uneasy.
<p/>Kitty was the only person who felt perfectly calm and happy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was distinctly conscious now of the birth of a new feeling of love for the future child, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to some extent actually existing already, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) brooded blissfully over this feeling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not by now altogether a part of herself, but sometimes lived his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own life independently of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>Often this separate being gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) pain, but at the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wanted to laugh with a strange new joy.
<p/>All the people she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) loved were with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and all were so good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), so attentively caring for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), so entirely pleasant was everything presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had not known and felt that it must all soon be over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not have wished for a better and pleasanter life.
<p/>The only thing that spoiled the charm of this manner of life was that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband was not here as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to be, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was in the country.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) liked his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) serene, friendly, and hospitable manner in the country.
<p/>In the town he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seemed continually uneasy and on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) guard, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were afraid someone would be rude to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and still more to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>At home in the country, knowing himself distinctly to be in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) right place, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was never in haste to be off elsewhere.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was never unoccupied.
<p/>Here in town he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was in a continual hurry, as though afraid of missing something, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had nothing to do.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>To others, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not appear an object of pity.
<p/>On the contrary, when Kitty looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in society, as one sometimes looks at those one loves, trying to see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were a stranger, so as to catch the impression he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) must make on others, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) saw with a panic even of jealous fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was far indeed from being a pitiable figure, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was very attractive with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fine breeding, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) rather old-fashioned, reserved courtesy with women, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) powerful figure, and striking, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) thought, and expressive face.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) not from without, but from within; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) saw that here he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was not himself; that was the only way she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could define his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) condition to herself.
<p/>Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) inwardly reproached him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) inability to live in the town; sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) recognized that it was really hard for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to order his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) life here so that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could be satisfied with it.
<p/>What had he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to do, indeed?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not care for cards; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not go to a club.
<p/>Spending the time with jovial gentlemen of Oblonsky's type--she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knew now what that meant...it meant drinking and going somewhere after drinking.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not think without horror of where men went on such occasions.
<p/>Was he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to go into society?
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could only find satisfaction in that if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) took pleasure in the society of young women, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not wish for.
<p/>Should he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stay at home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sisters?
<p/>But much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) liked and enjoyed their conversations forever on the same subjects--<div class="bookquote">``Aline-Nadine,''  (<font color='red'><b>the subjects</b></font>)</div>as the old prince called the sisters' talks--she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knew it must bore him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>).
<p/>What was there left for him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) to do?
<p/>To go on writing at his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) book he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had indeed attempted, and at first he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) used to go to the library and make extracts and look up references for his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) book.
<p/>But, as he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), the more he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) did nothing, the less time he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had to do anything.
<p/>And besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) complained that he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had talked too much about his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) book here, and that consequently all his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) ideas about it were muddled and had lost their interest for him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>).
<p/>One advantage in this town life was that quarrels hardly ever happened between them here in town.
<p/>Whether it was that their conditions were different, or that they had both become more careful and sensible in that respect, they had no quarrels in Moscow from jealousy, which they had so dreaded when they moved from the country.
<p/>One event, an event of great importance to both from that point of view, did indeed happen--that was Kitty's meeting with Vronsky.
<p/>The old Princess Marya Borissovna, Kitty's godmother, who had always been very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>), had insisted on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>).
<p/>Kitty, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did not go into society at all on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) condition, went with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father to see the venerable old lady, and there met Vronsky.
<p/>The only thing Kitty could reproach herself for at this meeting was that at the instant when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) recognized in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) civilian dress the features once so familiar to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) breath failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), the blood rushed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) heart, and a vivid blush--she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) felt it-- overspread her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face.
<p/>But this lasted only a few seconds.
<p/>Before her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father, who purposely began talking in a loud voice to Vronsky, had finished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was perfectly ready to look at Vronsky, to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), if necessary, exactly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) spoke to Princess Marya Borissovna, and more than that, to do so in such a way that everything to the faintest intonation and smile would have been approved by her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) husband, whose unseen presence she (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) seemed to feel about her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) at that instant.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) said a few words to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), even smiled serenely at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) joke about the elections, which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) called <div class="bookquote">``our parliament.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) had to smile to show she (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) saw the joke.-RRB-
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) turned away immediately to Princess Marya Borissovna, and did not once glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) got up to go; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), but evidently only because it would be uncivil not to look at a man when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is saying good-bye.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) was grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) father for saying nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) about their meeting Vronsky, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) saw by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) special warmth to her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) after the visit during their usual walk that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) was pleased with herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) had not expected she (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) would have had the power, while keeping somewhere in the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) heart all the memories of her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) old feeling for Vronsky, not only to seem but to be perfectly indifferent and composed with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>Levin flushed a great deal more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) had met Vronsky at Princess Marya Borissovna's.
<p/>It was very hard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) this, but still harder to go on speaking of the details of the meeting, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not question her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>), but simply gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) with a frown.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry you weren't there,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that you weren't in the room...I couldn't have been so natural in your presence...I am blushing now much more, much, much more,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) said, blushing till the tears came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But that you couldn't see through a crack.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>The truthful eyes told Levin that she (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) was satisfied with herself, and in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) blushing he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was quickly reassured and began questioning her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>), which was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) wanted.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had heard everything, even to the detail that for the first second she (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) could not help flushing, but that afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) was just as direct and as much at her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) ease as with any chance acquaintance, Levin was quite happy again and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was glad of it, and would not now behave as stupidly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had done at the election, but would try the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) met Vronsky to be as friendly as possible.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's so wretched to feel that there's a man almost an enemy whom it's painful to meet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very, very glad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty laughed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I suppose you used to pay calls before you were married, didn't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did, but I always felt ashamed, and now I'm so out of the way of it that, by Jove!
<p/>I'd sooner go two days running without my dinner than pay this call!

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, they won't.
<p/>I'll answer for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face with a laugh.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, good-bye.... Do go, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was just going out after kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wife's hand, when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kostya, do you know I've only fifty roubles left?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, all right, I'll go to the bank and get some.
<p/>How much?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) said, with the expression of dissatisfaction she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew so well.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, wait a minute.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's talk about it, it worries me.

<p/>We don't manage well, somehow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) said with a little cough, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) brows.
<p/>That cough she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew well.
<p/>It was a sign of intense dissatisfaction, not with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but with himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) certainly was displeased not at so much money being spent, but at being reminded of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>), knowing something was unsatisfactory, wanted to forget.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have told Sokolov to sell the wheat, and to borrow an advance on the mill.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sokolov</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sokolov</b></font>) had said it without thinking, simply to console her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sokolov</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and saw those sweet truthful eyes fastened questioningly on him (<font color='blue'><b>Sokolov</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Sokolov</b></font>) repeated it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sokolov</b></font>) whole heart.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was positively forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sokolov</b></font>) thought.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Sokolov</b></font>) remembered what was before them, so soon to come.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will it be soon?

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sokolov</b></font>) whispered, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) two hands.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have so often thought so, that now I don't think about it or know anything about it.''

<p/>Well, good-bye.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>On the steps Levin was stopped by his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) old servant Kouzma, who had been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) before his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) marriage, and now looked after their household in town.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beauty''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-that was the left shaft-horse brought up from the country-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``has been badly shod and is quite lame,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does your honor wish to be done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>During the first part of their stay in Moscow, Levin had used his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own horses brought up from the country.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had tried to arrange this part of their expenses in the best and cheapest way possible; but it appeared that their own horses came dearer than hired horses, and they still hired too.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Send for the veterinary, there may be a bruise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And for Katerina Alexandrovna?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kouzma</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Kouzma.
<p/>Levin was not by now struck as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been at first by the fact that to get from one end of Moscow to the other he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to have two powerful horses put into a heavy carriage, to take the carriage three miles through the snowy slush and to keep it standing there four hours, paying five roubles every time.
<p/>Now it seemed quite natural.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hire a pair for our carriage from the jobmaster,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>And so, simply and easily, thanks to the facilities of town life, Levin settled a question which, in the country, would have called for so much personal trouble and exertion, and going out onto the steps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) called a sledge, sat down, and drove to Nikitsky.
<p/>On the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought no more of money, but mused on the introduction that awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to the Petersburg savant, a writer on sociology, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) would say to him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) book.
<p/>Only during the first days of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) stay in Moscow Levin had been struck by the expenditure, strange to one living in the country, unproductive but inevitable, that was expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) on every side.
<p/>But by now he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had grown used to it.
<p/>That had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in this matter which is said to happen to drunkards--the first glass sticks in the throat, the second flies down like a hawk, but after the third they're like tiny little birds.
<p/>When Levin had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) first hundred-rouble note to pay for liveries for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) footmen and hall-porter he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not help reflecting that these liveries were of no use to anyone--but they were indubitably necessary, to judge by the amazement of the princess and Kitty when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) suggested that they might do without liveries,--that these liveries would cost the wages of two laborers for the summer, that is, would pay for about three hundred working days from Easter to Ash Wednesday, and each a day of hard work from early morning to late evening--and that hundred-rouble note did stick in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) throat.
<p/>But the next note, changed to pay for providing a dinner for their relations, that cost twenty-eight roubles, though it did excite in Levin the reflection that twenty-eight roubles meant nine measures of oats, which men would with groans and sweat have reaped and bound and thrashed and winnowed and sifted and sown,--this next one he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) parted with more easily.
<p/>And now the notes he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) changed no longer aroused such reflections, and they flew off like little birds.
<p/>Whether the labor devoted to obtaining the money corresponded to the pleasure given by what was bought with it, was a consideration he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had long ago dismissed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) business calculation that there was a certain price below which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not sell certain grain was forgotten too.
<p/>The rye, for the price of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had so long held out, had been sold for fifty kopecks a measure cheaper than it had been fetching a month ago.
<p/>Even the consideration that with such an expenditure he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not go on living for a year without debt, that even had no force.
<p/>Only one thing was essential: to have money in the bank, without inquiring where it came from, so as to know that one had the wherewithal to buy meat for tomorrow.
<p/>And this condition had hitherto been fulfilled; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had always had the money in the bank.
<p/>But now the money in the bank had gone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not quite tell where to get the next installment.
<p/>And this it was which, at the moment when Kitty had mentioned money, had disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had no time to think about it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drove off, thinking of Katavasov and the meeting with Metrov that was before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 3   Levin had on this visit to town seen a great deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) old friend at the university, Professor Katavasov, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had not seen since his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) marriage.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) liked in Katavasov the clearness and simplicity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) conception of life.
<p/>Levin thought that the clearness of Katavasov's conception of life was due to the poverty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) nature; Katavasov thought that the disconnectedness of Levin's ideas was due to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lack of intellectual discipline; but Levin enjoyed Katavasov's clearness, and Katavasov enjoyed the abundance of Levin's untrained ideas, and they liked to meet and to discuss.
<p/>Levin had read Katavasov some parts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) book, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had liked them.
<p/>On the previous day Katavasov had met Levin at a public lecture and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that the celebrated Metrov, whose article Levin had so much liked, was in Moscow, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been much interested by what Katavasov had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) about Levin's work, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was coming to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tomorrow at eleven, and would be very glad to make Levin's acquaintance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're positively a reformed character, I'm glad to see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div>said Katavasov, meeting Levin in the little drawing room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard the bell and thought:  Impossible that it can be he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) at the exact time!...
<p/>Well, what do you say to the Montenegrins now?
<p/>They're a race of warriors.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what's happened?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Levin.
<p/>Katavasov in a few words told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) the last piece of news from the war, and going into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) study, introduced Levin to a short, thick-set man of pleasant appearance.
<p/>This was Metrov.
<p/>The conversation touched for a brief space on politics and on how recent events were looked at in the higher spheres in Petersburg.
<p/>Metrov repeated a saying that had reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) through a most trustworthy source, reported as having been uttered on this subject by the Tsar and one of the ministers.
<p/>Katavasov had heard also on excellent authority that the Tsar had said something quite different.
<p/>Levin tried to imagine circumstances in which both sayings might have been uttered, and the conversation on that topic dropped.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, here he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s written almost a book on the natural conditions of the laborer in relation to the land,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div>said Katavasov; <div class="bookquote">``I'm not a specialist, but I, as a natural science man, was pleased at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not taking mankind as something outside biological laws; but, on the contrary, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dependence on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) surroundings, and in that dependence seeking the laws of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) development.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's very interesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Metrov</b></font>)</div>said Metrov.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I began precisely was to write a book on agriculture; but studying the chief instrument of agriculture, the laborer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, reddening, <div class="bookquote">``I could not help coming to quite unexpected results.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>And Levin began carefully, as it were, feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ground, to expound his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) views.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew Metrov had written an article against the generally accepted theory of political economy, but to what extent he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could reckon on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sympathy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own new views he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not know and could not guess from the clever and serene face of the learned man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But in what do you see the special characteristics of the Russian laborer?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Metrov</b></font>)</div><p/>said Metrov; <div class="bookquote">``in his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) biological characteristics, so to speak, or in the condition in which he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) is placed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Metrov</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin saw that there was an idea underlying this question with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not agree.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went on explaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own idea that the Russian laborer has a quite special view of the land, different from that of other people; and to support this proposition he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) made haste to add that in his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) opinion this attitude of the Russian peasant was due to the consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) vocation to people vast unoccupied expanses in the East.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One may easily be led into error in basing any conclusion on the general vocation of a people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Metrov</b></font>)</div>said Metrov, interrupting Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The condition of the laborer will always depend on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) relation to the land and to capital.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>And without letting Levin finish explaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) idea, Metrov began expounding to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) the special point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own theory.
<p/>In what the point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) theory lay, Levin did not understand, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not take the trouble to understand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw that Metrov, like other people, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own article, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had attacked the current theory of political economy, looked at the position of the Russian peasant simply from the point of view of capital, wages, and rent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) would indeed have been obliged to admit that in the eastern--much the larger--part of Russia rent was as yet nil, that for nine-tenths of the eighty millions of the Russian peasants wages took the form simply of food provided for themselves, and that capital does not so far exist except in the form of the most primitive tools.
<p/>Yet it was only from that point of view that he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) considered every laborer, though in many points he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) differed from the economists and had his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) own theory of the wage-fund, which he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) expounded to Levin.
<p/>Levin listened reluctantly, and at first made objections.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would have liked to interrupt Metrov, to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own thought, which in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) opinion would have rendered further exposition of Metrov's theories superfluous.
<p/>But later on, feeling convinced that they looked at the matter so differently, that they could never understand one another, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not even oppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) statements, but simply listened.
<p/>Although what Metrov was saying was by now utterly devoid of interest for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) yet experienced a certain satisfaction in listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>It flattered his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) vanity that such a learned man should explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ideas to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) so eagerly, with such intensity and confidence in Levin's understanding of the subject, sometimes with a mere hint referring him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to a whole aspect of the subject.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) put this down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own credit, unaware that Metrov, who had already discussed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) theory over and over again with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) intimate friends, talked of it with special eagerness to every new person, and in general was eager to talk to anyone of any subject that interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), even if still obscure to himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are late though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div>said Katavasov, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) watch directly Metrov had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) discourse.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there's a meeting of the Society of Amateurs today in commemoration of the jubilee of Svintitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div>said Katavasov in answer to Levin's inquiry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pyotr Ivanovitch and I were going.
<p/>I've promised to deliver an address on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) labors in zoology.
<p/>Come along with us, it's very interesting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and indeed it's time to start,''  (<font color='red'><b>Metrov</b></font>)</div>said Metrov.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come with us, and from there, if you care to, come to my place.
<p/>I should very much like to hear your work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!
<p/>It's no good yet, it's unfinished.
<p/>But I shall be very glad to go to the meeting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, friends, have you heard?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) has handed in the separate report,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div>Katavasov called from the other room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) frock coat.
<p/>And a conversation sprang up upon the university question, which was a very important event that winter in Moscow.
<p/>Three old professors in the council had not accepted the opinion of the younger professors.
<p/>The young ones had registered a separate resolution.
<p/>This, in the judgment of some people, was monstrous, in the judgment of others it was the simplest and most just thing to do, and the professors were split up into two parties.
<p/>One party, to which Katavasov belonged, saw in the opposite party a scoundrelly betrayal and treachery, while the opposite party saw in them childishness and lack of respect for the authorities.
<p/>Levin, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not belong to the university, had several times already during his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stay in Moscow heard and talked about this matter, and had his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own opinion on the subject.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took part in the conversation that was continued in the street, as they all three walked to the buildings of the old university.
<p/>The meeting had already begun.
<p/>Round the cloth-covered table, at which Katavasov and Metrov seated themselves, there were some half-dozen persons, and one of these was bending close over a manuscript, reading something aloud.
<p/>Levin sat down in one of the empty chairs that were standing round the table, and in a whisper asked a student sitting near what was being read.
<p/>The student, eyeing Levin with displeasure, said:  <div class="bookquote">``Biography.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Though Levin was not interested in the biography, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not help listening, and learned some new and interesting facts about the life of the distinguished man of science.
<p/>When the reader had finished, the chairman thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) and read some verses of the poet Ment sent him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) on the jubilee, and said a few words by way of thanks to the poet.
<p/>Then Katavasov in his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) loud, ringing voice read his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) address on the scientific labors of the man whose jubilee was being kept.
<p/>When Katavasov had finished, Levin looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) watch, saw it was past one, and thought that there would not be time before the concert to read Metrov his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) book, and indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not now care to do so.
<p/>During the reading he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had thought over their conversation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw distinctly now that though Metrov's ideas might perhaps have value, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own ideas had a value too, and their ideas could only be made clear and lead to something if each worked separately in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) chosen path, and that nothing would be gained by putting their ideas together.
<p/>And having made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind to refuse Metrov's invitation, Levin went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) at the end of the meeting.
<p/>Metrov introduced Levin to the chairman, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was talking of the political news.
<p/>Metrov told the chairman what he (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) had already told Levin, and Levin made the same remarks on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) news that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had already made that morning, but for the sake of variety he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) expressed also a new opinion which had only just struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>After that the conversation turned again on the university question.
<p/>As Levin had already heard it all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) made haste to tell Metrov that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not take advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) invitation, took leave, and drove to Lvov's.
<p/>Chapter 4   Lvov, the husband of Natalia, Kitty's sister, had spent all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) life in  foreign capitals, where he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been educated, and had been in the diplomatic service.
<p/>During the previous year he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had left the diplomatic service, not owing to any <div class="bookquote">``unpleasantness''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) never had any <div class="bookquote">``unpleasantness''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with anyone-RRB-, and was transferred to the department of the court of the palace in Moscow, in order to give his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) two boys the best education possible.
<p/>In spite of the striking contrast in their habits and views and the fact that Lvov was older than Levin, they had seen a great deal of one another that winter, and had taken a great liking to each other.
<p/>Lvov was at home, and Levin went in to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) unannounced.
<p/>Lvov, in a house coat with a belt and in chamois leather shoes, was sitting in an armchair, and with a pince-nez with blue glasses he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was reading a book that stood on a reading desk, while in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) beautiful hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) held a half-burned cigarette daintily away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) handsome, delicate, and still youthful-looking face, to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) curly, glistening silvery hair gave a still more aristocratic air, lighted up with a smile when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Capital!
<p/>I was meaning to send to you.
<p/>How's Kitty?
<p/>Sit here, it's more comfortable.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) got up and pushed up a rocking chair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you read the last circular in the  Journal de St. Petersbourg?
<p/>I think it's excellent,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, with a slight French accent.
<p/>Levin told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had heard from Katavasov was being said in Petersburg, and after talking a little about politics, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) interview with Metrov, and the learned society's meeting.
<p/>To Lvov it was very interesting.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I envy you, that you are able to mix in these interesting scientific circles,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) talked, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) passed as usual into French, which was easier to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's true I haven't the time for it.
<p/>My official work and the children leave me no time; and then I'm not ashamed to own that my education has been too defective.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I don't believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin with a smile, feeling, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) always did, touched at Lvov's low opinion of himself, which was not in the least put on from a desire to seem or to be modest, but was absolutely sincere.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, indeed!
<p/>I feel now how badly educated I am.
<p/>To educate my children I positively have to look up a great deal, and in fact simply to study myself.
<p/>For it's not enough to have teachers, there must be someone to look after them, just as on your land you want laborers and an overseer.
<p/>See what I'm reading'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>overseer</b></font>) pointed to Buslaev's  Grammar  on the desk--<div class="bookquote">``it's expected of Misha, and it's so difficult....  Come, explain to me....
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) says...''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Levin tried to explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that it couldn't be understood, but that it had to be taught; but Lvov would not agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you're laughing at it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, you can't imagine how, when I look at you, I'm always learning the task that lies before me, that is the education of one's children.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's nothing for you to learn,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Lvov.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, <div class="bookquote">``is that I have never seen better brought-up children than yours, and I wouldn't wish for children better than yours.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Lvov visibly tried to restrain the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) delight, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was positively radiant with smiles.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If only they're better than I!
<p/>That's all I desire.
<p/>You don't know yet all the work,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``with boys who've been left like mine to run wild abroad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll catch all that up.
<p/>They're such clever children.
<p/>The great thing is the education of character.
<p/>That's what I learn when I look at your children.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You talk of the education of character.
<p/>You can't imagine how difficult that is!
<p/>You have hardly succeeded in combating one tendency when others crop up, and the struggle begins again.
<p/>If one had not a support in religion--you remember we talked about that--no father could bring children up relying on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own strength alone without that help.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>This subject, which always interested Levin, was cut short by the entrance of the beauty Natalia Alexandrovna, dressed to go out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know you were here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Natalia</b></font>) said, unmistakably feeling no regret, but a positive pleasure, in interrupting this conversation on a topic she (<font color='blue'><b>Natalia</b></font>) had heard so much of that she (<font color='blue'><b>Natalia</b></font>) was by now weary of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how is Kitty?
<p/>I am dining with you today.
<p/>I tell you what, Arseny,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``you take the carriage.''
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>And the husband and wife began to discuss their arrangements for the day.
<p/>As the husband had to drive to meet someone on official business, while the wife had to go to the concert and some public meeting of a committee on the Eastern Question, there was a great deal to consider and settle.
<p/>Levin had to take part in their plans as one of themselves.
<p/>It was settled that Levin should go with Natalia to the concert and the meeting, and that from there they should send the carriage to the office for Arseny, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) should call for her (<font color='blue'><b>Natalia</b></font>) and take her (<font color='blue'><b>Natalia</b></font>) to Kitty's; or that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) should send the carriage back and Levin would go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s spoiling me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lvov</b></font>)</div>Lvov said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) assures me that our children are splendid, when I know how much that's bad there is in them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Arseny goes to extremes, I always say,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you look for perfection, you will never be satisfied.
<p/>And it's true, as papa says,--that when we were brought up there was one extreme--we were kept in the basement, while our parents lived in the best rooms; now it's just the other way--the parents are in the wash house, while the children are in the best rooms.
<p/>Parents now are not expected to live at all, but to exist altogether for their children.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what if they like it better?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lvov</b></font>)</div><p/>Lvov said, with his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) beautiful smile, touching her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyone who didn't know you would think you were a stepmother, not a true mother.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, extremes are not good in anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Natalia</b></font>)</div>Natalia said serenely, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) paper knife straight in its proper place on the table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, come here, you perfect children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lvov</b></font>)</div>Lvov said to the two handsome boys who came in, and after bowing to Levin, went up to their father, obviously wishing to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) about something.
<p/>Levin would have liked to talk to them, to hear what they would say to their father, but Natalia began talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and then Lvov's colleague in the service, Mahotin, walked in, wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) court uniform, to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to meet someone, and a conversation was kept up without a break upon Herzegovina, Princess Korzinskaya, the town council, and the sudden death of Madame Apraksina.
<p/>Levin even forgot the commission intrusted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) recollected it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was going into the hall.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Kitty told me to talk to you about Oblonsky,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, as Lvov was standing on the stairs, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife and Levin off.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, maman wants us,  les beaux-fr√®res,  to attack him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, blushing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I will attack him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Lvova</b></font>)</div>said Madame Lvova, with a smile, standing in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) white sheepskin cape, waiting till they had finished speaking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, let us go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 5   At the concert in the afternoon two very interesting things were performed.
<p/>One was a fantasia,  King Lear;  the other was a quartette dedicated to the memory of Bach.
<p/>Both were new and in the new style, and Levin was eager to form an opinion of them.
<p/>After escorting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sister-in-law to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) stall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stood against a column and tried to listen as attentively and conscientiously as possible.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tried not to let his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) attention be distracted, and not to spoil his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) impression by looking at the conductor in a white tie, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arms, which always disturbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) enjoyment of music so much, or the ladies in bonnets, with strings carefully tied over their ears, and all these people either thinking of nothing at all or thinking of all sorts of things except the music.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tried to avoid meeting musical connoisseurs or talkative acquaintances, and stood looking at the floor straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), listening.
<p/>But the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) listened to the fantasia of King Lear the further he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) felt from forming any definite opinion of it.
<p/>There was, as it were, a continual beginning, a preparation of the musical expression of some feeling, but it fell to pieces again directly, breaking into new musical motives, or simply nothing but the whims of the composer, exceedingly complex but disconnected sounds.
<p/>And these fragmentary musical expressions, though sometimes beautiful, were disagreeable, because they were utterly unexpected and not led up to by anything.
<p/>Gaiety and grief and despair and tenderness and triumph followed one another without any connection, like the emotions of a madman.
<p/>And those emotions, like a madman's, sprang up quite unexpectedly.
<p/>During the whole of the performance Levin felt like a deaf man watching people dancing, and was in a state of complete bewilderment when the fantasia was over, and felt a great weariness from the fruitless strain on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) attention.
<p/>Loud applause resounded on all sides.
<p/>Everyone got up, moved about, and began talking.
<p/>Anxious to throw some light on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own perplexity from the impressions of others, Levin began to walk about, looking for connoisseurs, and was glad to see a well-known musical amateur in conversation with Pestsov, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marvelous!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pestsov</b></font>)</div><p/>Pestsov was saying in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mellow bass.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you, Konstantin Dmitrievitch?
<p/>Particularly sculpturesque and plastic, so to say, and richly colored is that passage where you feel Cordelia's approach, where woman,  das ewig Weibliche,  enters into conflict with fate.
<p/>Isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean...what has Cordelia to do with it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin asked timidly, forgetting that the fantasia was supposed to represent King Lear.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cordelia comes in...see here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pestsov</b></font>)</div><p/>said Pestsov, tapping his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) finger on the satiny surface of the program he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hand and passing it to Levin.
<p/>Only then Levin recollected the title of the fantasia, and made haste to read in the Russian translation the lines from Shakespeare that were printed on the back of the program.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't follow it without that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pestsov</b></font>)</div>said Pestsov, addressing Levin, as the person he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been speaking to had gone away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had no one to talk to.
<p/>In the  entr`acte  Levin and Pestsov fell into an argument upon the merits and defects of music of the Wagner school.
<p/>Levin maintained that the mistake of Wagner and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) followers lay in their trying to take music into the sphere of another art, just as poetry goes wrong when it tries to paint a face as the art of painting ought to do, and as an instance of this mistake he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) cited the sculptor who carved in marble certain poetic phantasms flitting round the figure of the poet on the pedestal.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``These phantoms were so far from being phantoms that they were positively clinging on the ladder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/>The comparison pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not remember whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had not used the same phrase before, and to Pestsov, too, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said it he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt confused.
<p/>Pestsov maintained that art is one, and that it can attain its highest manifestations only by conjunction with all kinds of art.
<p/>The second piece that was performed Levin could not hear.
<p/>Pestsov, who was standing beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), was talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) almost all the time, condemning the music for its excessive affected assumption of simplicity, and comparing it with the simplicity of the Pre-Raphaelites in painting.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went out Levin met many more acquaintances, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) talked of politics, of music, and of common acquaintances.
<p/>Among others he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) met Count Bol, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had utterly forgotten to call upon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, go at once then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Lvova</b></font>)</div>Madame Lvova said, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``perhaps they'll not be at home, and then you can come to the meeting to fetch me.
<p/>You'll find me still there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 6   <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps they're not at home?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went into the hall of Countess Bola's house.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At home; please walk in,''  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div>said the porter, resolutely removing his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) overcoat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How annoying!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Levin with a sigh, taking off one glove and stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did I come for?
<p/>What have I to say to them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) passed through the first drawing room Levin met in the doorway Countess Bola, giving some order to a servant with a care-worn and severe face.
<p/>On seeing Levin she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) smiled, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to come into the little drawing room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard voices.
<p/>In this room there were sitting in armchairs the two daughters of the countess, and a Moscow colonel, whom Levin knew.
<p/>Levin went up, greeted them, and sat down beside the sofa with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knees.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is your wife?
<p/>Have you been at the concert?
<p/>We couldn't go.
<p/>Mamma had to be at the funeral service.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I heard....  What a sudden death!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin.
<p/>The countess came in, sat down on the sofa, and she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) too asked after his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife and inquired about the concert.
<p/>Levin answered, and repeated an inquiry about Madame Apraksina's sudden death.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) was always in weak health.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you at the opera yesterday?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I was.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucca was very good.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, and as it was utterly of no consequence to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) what they thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began repeating what they had heard a hundred times about the characteristics of the singer's talent.
<p/>Countess Bola pretended to be listening.
<p/>Then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had said enough and paused, the colonel, who had been silent till then, began to talk.
<p/>The colonel too talked of the opera, and about culture.
<p/>At last, after speaking of the proposed  folle journ√©e  at Turin's, the colonel laughed, got up noisily, and went away.
<p/>Levin too rose, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw by the face of the countess that it was not yet time for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to go.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must stay two minutes longer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sat down.
<p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was thinking all the while how stupid it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not find a subject for conversation, and sat silent.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not going to the public meeting?
<p/>They say it will be very interesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>the countess</b></font>)</div>began the countess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I promised my belle-soeur to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) from it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/>A silence followed.
<p/>The mother once more exchanged glances with a daughter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now I think the time has come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>thought Levin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) got up.
<p/>The ladies shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to say mille choses  to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife for them.
<p/>The porter asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) coat, <div class="bookquote">``Where is your honor staying?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>and immediately wrote down his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) address in a big handsomely bound book.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I don't care, but still I feel ashamed and awfully stupid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>thought Levin, consoling himself with the reflection that everyone does it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drove to the public meeting, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sister-in-law, so as to drive home with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>).
<p/>At the public meeting of the committee there were a great many people, and almost all the highest society.
<p/>Levin was in time for the report which, as everyone said, was very interesting.
<p/>When the reading of the report was over, people moved about, and Levin met Sviazhsky, who invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) very pressingly to come that evening to a meeting of the Society of Agriculture, where a celebrated lecture was to be delivered, and Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had only just come from the races, and many other acquaintances; and Levin heard and uttered various criticisms on the meeting, on the new fantasia, and on a public trial.
<p/>But, probably from the mental fatigue he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was beginning to feel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) made a blunder in speaking of the trial, and this blunder he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) recalled several times with vexation.
<p/>Speaking of the sentence upon a foreigner who had been condemned in Russia, and of how unfair it would be to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) by exile abroad, Levin repeated what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had heard the day before in conversation from an acquaintance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) abroad is much the same as punishing a carp by putting it into the water,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) recollected that this idea, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had heard from an acquaintance and uttered as his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own, came from a fable of Krilov's, and that the acquaintance had picked it up from a newspaper article.
<p/>After driving home with his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sister-in-law, and finding Kitty in good spirits and quite well, Levin drove to the club.
<p/>Chapter 7   Levin reached the club just at the right time.
<p/>Members and visitors were driving up as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arrived.
<p/>Levin had not been at the club for a very long while--not since he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lived in Moscow, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was leaving the university and going into society.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) remembered the club, the external details of its arrangement, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had completely forgotten the impression it had made on him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in old days.
<p/>But as soon as, driving into the wide semicircular court and getting out of the sledge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mounted the steps, and the hall porter, adorned with a crossway scarf, noiselessly opened the door to him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) with a bow; as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) saw in the porter's room the cloaks and galoshes of members who thought it less trouble to take them off downstairs; as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) heard the mysterious ringing bell that preceded him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) ascended the easy, carpeted staircase, and saw the statue on the landing, and the third porter at the top doors, a familiar figure grown older, in the club livery, opening the door without haste or delay, and scanning the visitors as they passed in--Levin felt the old impression of the club come back in a rush, an impression of repose, comfort, and propriety.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your hat, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div>the porter said to Levin, who forgot the club rule to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hat in the porter's room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Long time since you've been.
<p/>The prince put your name down yesterday.
<p/>Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch is not here yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The porter</b></font>)</div><p/>The porter did not only know Levin, but also all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ties and relationships, and so immediately mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) intimate friends.
<p/>Passing through the outer hall, divided up by screens, and the room partitioned on the right, where a man sits at the fruit buffet, Levin overtook an old man walking slowly in, and entered the dining room full of noise and people.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) walked along the tables, almost all full, and looked at the visitors.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw people of all sorts, old and young; some he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew a little, some intimate friends.
<p/>There was not a single cross or worried-looking face.
<p/>All seemed to have left their cares and anxieties in the porter's room with their hats, and were all deliberately getting ready to enjoy the material blessings of life.
<p/>Sviazhsky was here and Shtcherbatsky, Nevyedovsky and the old prince, and Vronsky and Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>why are you late?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>the prince said smiling, and giving him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) own shoulder.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How's Kitty?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) added, smoothing out the napkin he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had tucked in at his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) waistcoat buttons.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right; they are dining at home, all the three of them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, `Aline-Nadine,' to be sure!
<p/>There's no room with us.
<p/>Go to that table, and make haste and take a seat,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div>said the prince, and turning away he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) carefully took a plate of eel soup.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Levin, this way!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>a good-natured voice shouted a little farther on.
<p/>It was Turovtsin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was sitting with a young officer, and beside them were two chairs turned upside down.
<p/>Levin gladly went up to them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had always liked the good-hearted rake, Turovtsin--he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was associated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind with memories of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) courtship--and at that moment, after the strain of intellectual conversation, the sight of Turovtsin's good-natured face was particularly welcome.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For you and Oblonsky.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'ll be here directly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man, holding himself very erect, with eyes forever twinkling with enjoyment, was an officer from Petersburg, Gagin.
<p/>Turovtsin introduced them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oblonsky's always late.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, here he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you only just come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Oblonsky, coming quickly towards them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good day.
<p/>Had some vodka?
<p/>Well, come along then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin got up and went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to the big table spread with spirits and appetizers of the most various kinds.
<p/>One would have thought that out of two dozen delicacies one might find something to one's taste, but Stepan Arkadyevitch asked for something special, and one of the liveried waiters standing by immediately brought what was required.
<p/>They drank a wine glassful and returned to their table.
<p/>At once, while they were still at the soup, Gagin was served with champagne, and told the waiter to fill four glasses.
<p/>Levin did not refuse the wine, and asked for a second bottle.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was very hungry, and ate and drank with great enjoyment, and with still greater enjoyment took part in the lively and simple conversation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) companions.
<p/>Gagin, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) voice, told the last good story from Petersburg, and the story, though improper and stupid, was so ludicrous that Levin broke into roars of laughter so loud that those near looked round.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's in the same style as, `that's a thing I can't endure!'
<p/>You know the story?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's exquisite!
<p/>Another bottle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to the waiter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began to relate his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) good story.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pyotr Illyitch Vinovsky invites you to drink with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>a waiter Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>a little old waiter interrupted Stepan Arkadyevitch, bringing two delicate glasses of sparkling champagne, and addressing Stepan Arkadyevitch and Levin.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch took the glass, and looking towards a bald man with red mustaches at the other end of the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nodded to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You met him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) once at my place, don't you remember?
<p/>A good-natured fellow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin did the same as Stepan Arkadyevitch and took the glass.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch's anecdote too was very amusing.
<p/>Levin told his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) story, and that too was successful.
<p/>Then they talked of horses, of the races, of what they had been doing that day, and of how smartly Vronsky's Atlas had won the first prize.
<p/>Levin did not notice how the time passed at dinner.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>and here they are!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch said towards the end of dinner, leaning over the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) chair and holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand to Vronsky, who came up with a tall officer of the Guards.
<p/>Vronsky's face too beamed with the look of good-humored enjoyment that was general in the club.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) propped his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) elbow playfully on Stepan Arkadyevitch's shoulder, whispering something to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) hand to Levin with the same good-humored smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very glad to meet you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I looked out for you at the election, but I was told you had gone away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I left the same day.
<p/>We've just been talking of your horse.
<p/>I congratulate you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was very rapidly run.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; you've race horses too, haven't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my father had; but I remember and know something about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where have you dined?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We were at the second table, behind the columns.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We've been celebrating his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) success,''  (<font color='red'><b>the colonel</b></font>)</div>said the tall colonel.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) second Imperial prize.
<p/>I wish I might have the luck at cards he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has with horses.
<p/>Well, why waste the precious time?
<p/>I'm going to the `infernal regions,'''  (<font color='red'><b>the colonel</b></font>)</div>added the colonel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) walked away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's Yashvin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>Vronsky said in answer to Turovtsin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) sat down in the vacated seat beside them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) drank the glass offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), and ordered a bottle of wine.
<p/>Under the influence of the club atmosphere or the wine he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had drunk, Levin chatted away to Vronsky of the best breeds of cattle, and was very glad not to feel the slightest hostility to this man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), among other things, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had heard from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had met him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at Princess Marya Borissovna's.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Princess Marya Borissovna, she (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>)'s exquisite!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told an anecdote about her (<font color='blue'><b>Borissovna</b></font>) which set them all laughing.
<p/>Vronsky particularly laughed with such simplehearted amusement that Levin felt quite reconciled to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, have we finished?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting up with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 8   Getting up from the table, Levin walked with Gagin through the lofty room to the billiard room, feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arms swing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) walked with a peculiar lightness and ease.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) crossed the big room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) came upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) father-in-law.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how do you like our Temple of Indolence?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>said the prince, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) arm.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along, come along!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I wanted to walk about and look at everything.
<p/>It's interesting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's interesting for you.
<p/>But its interest for me is quite different.
<p/>You look at those little old men now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) said, pointing to a club member with bent back and projecting lip, shuffling towards them in his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) soft boots, <div class="bookquote">``and imagine that they were  shlupiks  like that from their birth up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>lip shuffling</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How  shlupiks ?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you don't know that name.
<p/>That's our club designation.
<p/>You know the game of rolling eggs: when one's rolled a long while it becomes a  shlupik .
<p/>So it is with us; one goes on coming and coming to the club, and ends by becoming a  shlupik .
<p/>Ah, you laugh!
<p/>but we look out, for fear of dropping into it ourselves.
<p/>You know Prince Tchetchensky?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>inquired the prince; and Levin saw by his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was just going to relate something funny.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't say so!
<p/>Well, Prince Tchetchensky is a well-known figure.
<p/>No matter, though.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>)'s always playing billiards here.
<p/>Only three years ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>) was not a  shlupik  and kept up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>) spirits and even used to call other people  shlupiks .
<p/>But one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>) turns up, and our porter...you know Vassily?
<p/>Why, that fat one; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>)'s famous for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>)  bon mots .
<p/>And so Prince Tchetchensky asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>), `Come, Vassily, who's here?
<p/>Any  shlupiks  here yet?'
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>) says, `You're the third.'
<p/>Yes, my dear boy, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the friends</b></font>)</div><p/>Talking and greeting the friends they met, Levin and the prince walked through all the rooms: the great room where tables had already been set, and the usual partners were playing for small stakes; the divan room, where they were playing chess, and Sergey Ivanovitch was sitting talking to somebody; the billiard room, where, about a sofa in a recess, there was a lively party drinking champagne--Gagin was one of them.
<p/>They peeped into the <div class="bookquote">``infernal regions,''  (<font color='red'><b>a men</b></font>)</div>where a good many men were crowding round one table, at which Yashvin was sitting.
<p/>Trying not to make a noise, they walked into the dark reading room, where under the shaded lamps there sat a young man with a wrathful countenance, turning over one journal after another, and a bald general buried in a book.
<p/>They went, too, into what the prince called the intellectual room, where three gentlemen were engaged in a heated discussion of the latest political news.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Prince, please come, we're ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>card party</b></font>)</div>said one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) card party, who had come to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), and the prince went off.
<p/>Levin sat down and listened, but recalling all the conversation of the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt all of a sudden fearfully bored.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) got up hurriedly, and went to look for Oblonsky and Turovtsin, with whom it had been so pleasant.
<p/>Turovtsin was one of the circle drinking in the billiard room, and Stepan Arkadyevitch was talking with Vronsky near the door at the farther corner of the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>)'s dull; but this undefined, this unsettled position,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin caught, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was hurrying away, but Stepan Arkadyevitch called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Levin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and Levin noticed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes were not full of tears exactly, but moist, which always happened when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been drinking, or when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was touched.
<p/>Just now it was due to both causes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Levin, don't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) warmly squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arm above the elbow, obviously not at all wishing to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) go.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a true friend of mine--almost my greatest friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said to Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have become even closer and dearer to me.
<p/>And I want you, and I know you ought, to be friends, and great friends, because you're both splendid fellows.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's nothing for us now but to kiss and be friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div>Vronsky said, with good-natured playfulness, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Levin quickly took the offered hand, and pressed it warmly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very, very glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Waiter, a bottle of champagne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'm very glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky.
<p/>But in spite of Stepan Arkadyevitch's desire, and their own desire, they had nothing to talk about, and both felt it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) has never met Anna?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch said to Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I want above everything to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Let us go, Levin!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) will be very glad to see you.
<p/>I should be going home at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``but I'm worried about Yashvin, and I want to stay on till he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) finishes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) losing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) keeps losing, and I'm the only friend that can restrain him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what do you say to pyramids?
<p/>Levin, will you play?
<p/>Capital!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get the table ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to the marker.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been ready a long while,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the marker, who had already set the balls in a triangle, and was knocking the red one about for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own diversion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let us begin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>After the game Vronsky and Levin sat down at Gagin's table, and at Stepan Arkadyevitch's suggestion Levin took a hand in the game.
<p/>Vronsky sat down at the table, surrounded by friends, who were incessantly coming up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Every now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went to the <div class="bookquote">``infernal''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to keep an eye on Yashvin.
<p/>Levin was enjoying a delightful sense of repose after the mental fatigue of the morning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was glad that all hostility was at an end with Vronsky, and the sense of peace, decorum, and comfort never left him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>When the game was over, Stepan Arkadyevitch took Levin's arm.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let us go to Anna's, then.
<p/>At once?
<p/>Eh?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is at home.
<p/>I promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) long ago to bring you.
<p/>Where were you meaning to spend the evening?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nowhere specially.
<p/>I promised Sviazhsky to go to the Society of Agriculture.
<p/>By all means, let us go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good; come along.
<p/>Find out if my carriage is here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>Stepan Arkadyevitch said to the waiter.
<p/>Levin went up to the table, paid the forty roubles he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had lost; paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bill, the amount of which was in some mysterious way ascertained by the little old waiter who stood at the counter, and swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) arms he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) walked through all the rooms to the way out.
<p/>Chapter 9   <div class="bookquote">``Oblonsky's carriage!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div><p/>the porter shouted in an angry bass.
<p/>The carriage drove up and both got in.
<p/>It was only for the first few moments, while the carriage was driving out of the clubhouse gates, that Levin was still under the influence of the club atmosphere of repose, comfort, and unimpeachable good form.
<p/>But as soon as the carriage drove out into the street, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt it jolting over the uneven road, heard the angry shout of a sledge driver coming towards them, saw in the uncertain light the red blind of a tavern and the shops, this impression was dissipated, and he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) began to think over his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) actions, and to wonder whether he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) was doing right in going to see Anna.
<p/>What would Kitty say?
<p/>But Stepan Arkadyevitch gave him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) no time for reflection, and, as though divining his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) doubts, he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) scattered them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How glad I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that you should know her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)!
<p/>You know Dolly has long wished for it.

 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why especially now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are carrying on negotiations with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) husband about a divorce.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s agreed; but there are difficulties in regard to the son, and the business, which ought to have been arranged long ago, has been dragging on for three months past.
<p/>As soon as the divorce is over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) will marry Vronsky.
<p/>How stupid these old ceremonies are, that no one believes in, and which only prevent people being comfortable!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch put in.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then their position will be as regular as mine, as yours.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the difficulty?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's a long and tedious story!
<p/>The whole business is in such an anomalous position with us.
<p/>But the point is she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) has been for three months in Moscow, where everyone knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), waiting for the divorce; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) goes out nowhere, sees no woman except Dolly, because, do you understand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) doesn't care to have people come as a favor.
<p/>That fool Princess Varvara, even she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) has left her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), considering this a breach of propriety.
<p/>Well, you see, in such a position any other woman would not have found resources in herself.
<p/>But you'll see how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life--how calm, how dignified she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is.
<p/>To the left, in the crescent opposite the church!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch, leaning out of the window.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Phew!
<p/>how hot it is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said, in spite of twelve degrees of frost, flinging his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) open overcoat still wider open.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has a daughter: no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s busy looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you picture every woman simply as a female,  une couveuse, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)'s occupied, it must be with her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) children.
<p/>No, she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) brings her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) up capitally, I believe, but one doesn't hear about her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)'s busy, in the first place, with what she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) writes.
<p/>I see you're smiling ironically, but you're wrong.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)'s writing a children's book, and doesn't talk about it to anyone, but she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) read it to me and I gave the manuscript to Vorkuev...you know the publisher...and he (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)'s an author himself too, I fancy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) understands those things, and he (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) says it's a remarkable piece of work.
<p/>But are you fancying she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)'s an authoress?--not a bit of it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)'s a woman with a heart, before everything, but you'll see.
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) has a little English girl with her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>), and a whole family she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)'s looking after.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>)'s completely given up to drink--delirium tremens-- and the family were cast on the world.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) saw them, helped them, got more and more interested in them, and now the whole family is on her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) hands.
<p/>But not by way of patronage, you know, helping with money; she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)'s herself preparing the boys in Russian for the high school, and she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)'s taken the little girl to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>).
<p/>But you'll see her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) for yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>The carriage drove into the courtyard, and Stepan Arkadyevitch rang loudly at the entrance where sledges were standing.
<p/>And without asking the servant who opened the door whether the lady were at home, Stepan Arkadyevitch walked into the hall.
<p/>Levin followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), more and more doubtful whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was doing right or wrong.
<p/>Looking at himself in the glass, Levin noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was red in the face, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt certain he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not drunk, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) followed Stepan Arkadyevitch up the carpeted stairs.
<p/>At the top Stepan Arkadyevitch inquired of the footman, who bowed to him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) as to an intimate friend, who was with Anna Arkadyevna, and received the answer that it was M. Vorkuev.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the study.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Passing through the dining room, a room not very large, with dark, paneled walls, Stepan Arkadyevitch and Levin walked over the soft carpet to the half-dark study, lighted up by a single lamp with a big dark shade.
<p/>Another lamp with a reflector was hanging on the wall, lighting up a big full-length portrait of a woman, which Levin could not help looking at.
<p/>It was the portrait of Anna, painted in Italy by Mihailov.
<p/>While Stepan Arkadyevitch went behind the  treillage , and the man's voice which had been speaking paused, Levin gazed at the portrait, which stood out from the frame in the brilliant light thrown on it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not tear himself away from it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) positively forgot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was, and not even hearing what was said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not take his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes off the marvelous portrait.
<p/>It was not a picture, but a living, charming woman, with black curling hair, with bare arms and shoulders, with a pensive smile on the lips, covered with soft down; triumphantly and softly she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with eyes that baffled him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not living only because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was more beautiful than a living woman can be.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am delighted!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard suddenly near him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) a voice, unmistakably addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), the voice of the very woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been admiring in the portrait.
<p/>Anna had come from behind the treillage to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and Levin saw in the dim light of the study the very woman of the portrait, in a dark blue shot gown, not in the same position nor with the same expression, but with the same perfection of beauty which the artist had caught in the portrait.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was less dazzling in reality, but, on the other hand, there was something fresh and seductive in the living woman which was not in the portrait.
<p/>Chapter 10   She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had risen to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>), not concealing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pleasure at seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>);  and in the quiet ease with which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little vigorous hand, introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) to Vorkuev and indicated a red-haired, pretty little girl who was sitting at work, calling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pupil, Levin recognized and liked the manners of a woman of the great world, always self-possessed and natural.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am delighted, delighted,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) repeated, and on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips these simple words took for Levin's ears a special significance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have known you and liked you for a long while, both from your friendship with Stiva and for your wife's sake....
<p/>I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for a very short time, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) left on me the impression of an exquisite flower, simply a flower.
<p/>And to think she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will soon be a mother!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) spoke easily and without haste, looking now and then from Levin to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brother, and Levin felt that the impression he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was making was good, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt immediately at home, simple and happy with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had known her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from childhood.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ivan Petrovitch and I settled in Alexey's study,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said in answer to Stepan Arkadyevitch's question whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) might smoke, <div class="bookquote">``just so as to be able to smoke'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and glancing at Levin, instead of asking whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would smoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pulled closer a tortoise-shell cigar-case and took a cigarette.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you feeling today?''
 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brother asked her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing.
<p/>Nerves, as usual.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, isn't it extraordinarily fine?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, noticing that Levin was scrutinizing the picture.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never seen a better portrait.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And extraordinarily like, isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vorkuev</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vorkuev.
<p/>Levin looked from the portrait to the original.
<p/>A peculiar brilliance lighted up Anna's face when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Levin flushed, and to cover his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) confusion would have asked whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had seen Darya Alexandrovna lately; but at that moment Anna spoke.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We were just talking, Ivan Petrovitch and I, of Vashtchenkov's last pictures.
<p/>Have you seen them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have seen them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, I beg your pardon, I interrupted you...you were saying?...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had seen Dolly lately.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was here yesterday.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was very indignant with the high school people on Grisha's account.
<p/>The Latin teacher, it seems, had been unfair to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pictures.
<p/>I didn't care for them very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin went back to the subject she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had started.
<p/>Levin talked now not at all with that purely businesslike attitude to the subject with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been talking all the morning.
<p/>Every word in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had a special significance.
<p/>And talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was pleasant; still pleasanter it was to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Anna talked not merely naturally and cleverly, but cleverly and carelessly, attaching no value to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own ideas and giving great weight to the ideas of the person she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was talking to.
<p/>The conversation turned on the new movement in art, on the new illustrations of the Bible by a French artist.
<p/>Vorkuev attacked the artist for a realism carried to the point of coarseness.
<p/>Levin said that the French had carried conventionality further than anyone, and that consequently they see a great merit in the return to realism.
<p/>In the fact of not lying they see poetry.
<p/>Never had anything clever said by Levin given him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) so much pleasure as this remark.
<p/>Anna's face lighted up at once, as at once she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) appreciated the thought.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) laughed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I laugh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``as one laughs when one sees a very true portrait.
<p/>What you said so perfectly hits off French art now, painting and literature too, indeed--Zola, Daudet.
<p/>But perhaps it is always so, that men form their conceptions from fictitious, conventional types, and then--all the  combinaisons  made--they are tired of the fictitious figures and begin to invent more natural, true figures.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's perfectly true,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Vorknev.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you've been at the club?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, this is a woman!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin thought, forgetting himself and staring persistently at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lovely, mobile face, which at that moment was all at once completely transformed.
<p/>Levin did not hear what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was talking of as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) leaned over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) brother, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was struck by the change of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) expression.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face--so handsome a moment before in its repose--suddenly wore a look of strange curiosity, anger, and pride.
<p/>But this lasted only an instant.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyelids, as though recollecting something.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, but that's of no interest to anyone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) turned to the English girl.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please order the tea in the drawing room,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said in English.
<p/>The girl got up and went out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how did she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) get through her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) examination?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Splendidly!

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will end in your loving her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) more than your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) glanced again at Levin.
<p/>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) smile and her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) glance-- all told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that it was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) only she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) was addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) words, valuing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) good opinion, and at the same time sure beforehand that they understood each other.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite understand that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's impossible to give one's heart to a school or such institutions in general, and I believe that's just why philanthropic institutions always give such poor results.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) was silent for a while, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) smiled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) agreed; <div class="bookquote">``I never could.

<p/>And now more than ever,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) said with a mournful, confiding expression, ostensibly addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) brother, but unmistakably intending her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) words only for Levin, <div class="bookquote">``now when I have such need of some occupation, I cannot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>And suddenly frowning -LRB-Levin saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) was frowning at herself for talking about herself-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) changed the subject.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) said to Levin; <div class="bookquote">``that you're not a public-spirited citizen, and I have defended you to the best of my ability.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How have you defended me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, according to the attacks made on you.
<p/>But won't you have some tea?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) rose and took up a book bound in morocco.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give it to me, Anna Arkadyevna,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vorkuev</b></font>)</div>said Vorkuev, indicating the book.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's well worth taking up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>Stepan Arkadyevitch said to his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) sister, nodding at Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't have.
<p/>My writing is something after the fashion of those little baskets and carving which Liza Mertsalova used to sell me from the prisons.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) had the direction of the prison department in that society,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) turned to Levin; <div class="bookquote">``and they were miracles of patience, the work of those poor wretches.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>And Levin saw a new trait in this woman, who attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) so extraordinarily.
<p/>Besides wit, grace, and beauty, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had truth.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no wish to hide from him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) all the bitterness of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) position.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sighed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face suddenly taking a hard expression, looked as it were turned to stone.
<p/>With that expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was more beautiful than ever; but the expression was new; it was utterly unlike that expression, radiant with happiness and creating happiness, which had been caught by the painter in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) portrait.
<p/>Levin looked more than once at the portrait and at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) figure, as taking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother's arm she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) walked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to the high doors and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a tenderness and pity at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wondered himself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked Levin and Vorkuev to go into the drawing room, while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stayed behind to say a few words to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``About her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) divorce, about Vronsky, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s doing at the club, about me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>wondered Levin.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was so keenly interested by the question of what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was saying to Stepan Arkadyevitch, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) scarcely heard what Vorkuev was telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) of the qualities of the story for children Anna Arkadyevna had written.
<p/>At tea the same pleasant sort of talk, full of interesting matter, continued.
<p/>There was not a single instant when a subject for conversation was to seek; on the contrary, it was felt that one had hardly time to say what one had to say, and eagerly held back to hear what the others were saying.
<p/>And all that was said, not only by her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>), but by Vorkuev and Stepan Arkadyevitch--all, so it seemed to Levin, gained peculiar significance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) appreciation and her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) criticism.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) followed this interesting conversation, Levin was all the time admiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>)-- her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) beauty, her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) intelligence, her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) culture, and at the same time her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) directness and genuine depth of feeling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) listened and talked, and all the while he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) inner life, trying to divine her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) feelings.
<p/>And though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had judged her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) so severely hitherto, now by some strange chain of reasoning he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was justifying her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) and was also sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>), and afraid that Vronsky did not fully understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>).
<p/>At eleven o'clock, when Stepan Arkadyevitch got up to go -LRB-Vorkuev had left earlier-RRB-, it seemed to Levin that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had only just come.
<p/>Regretfully Levin too rose.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) said, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand and glancing into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) face with a winning look.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad  que la glace est rompue. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand, and half closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell your wife that I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) as before, and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) cannot pardon me my position, then my wish for her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) may never pardon it.
<p/>To pardon it, one must go through what I have gone through, and may God spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, yes, I will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>)...''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin said, blushing.
<p/>Chapter 11   <div class="bookquote">``What a marvelous, sweet and unhappy woman!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was thinking, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stepped out into the frosty air with Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, didn't I tell you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, seeing that Levin had been completely won over.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin dreamily, <div class="bookquote">``an extraordinary woman!
<p/>It's not her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cleverness, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has such wonderful depth of feeling.
<p/>I'm awfully sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, please God, everything will soon be settled.
<p/>Well, well, don't be hard on people in future,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, opening the carriage door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye; we don't go the same way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Still thinking of Anna, of everything, even the simplest phrase in their conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and recalling the minutest changes in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) expression, entering more and more into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) position, and feeling sympathy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), Levin reached home.
<p/>At home Kouzma told Levin that Katerina Alexandrovna was quite well, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) sisters had not long been gone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) two letters.
<p/>Levin read them at once in the hall, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) might not over look them later.
<p/>One was from Sokolov, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sokolov</b></font>) bailiff.
<p/>Sokolov wrote that the corn could not be sold, that it was fetching only five and a half roubles, and that more than that could not be got for it.
<p/>The other letter was from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sokolov</b></font>) sister.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) scolded him (<font color='blue'><b>Sokolov</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) business being still unsettled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we must sell it at five and a half if we can't get more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin decided the first question, which had always before seemed such a weighty one, with extraordinary facility on the spot.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's extraordinary how all one's time is taken up here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought, considering the second letter.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt himself to blame for not having got done what his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sister had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to do for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Today, again, I've not been to the court, but today I've certainly not had time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And resolving that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would not fail to do it next day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went in, Levin rapidly ran through mentally the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had spent.
<p/>All the events of the day were conversations, conversations he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had heard and taken part in.
<p/>All the conversations were upon subjects which, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been alone at home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would never have taken up, but here they were very interesting.
<p/>And all these conversations were right enough, only in two places there was something not quite right.
<p/>One was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had said about the carp, the other was something not <div class="bookquote">``quite the thing''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in the tender sympathy he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was feeling for Anna.
<p/>Levin found his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife low-spirited and dull.
<p/>The dinner of the three sisters had gone off very well, but then they had waited and waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), all of them had felt dull, the sisters had departed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been left alone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and what have you been doing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), looking straight into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes, which shone with rather a suspicious brightness.
<p/>But that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might not prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) telling her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) everything, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) concealed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) close scrutiny of him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and with an approving smile listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) account of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had spent the evening.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm very glad I met Vronsky.
<p/>I felt quite at ease and natural with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>You understand, I shall try not to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), but I'm glad that this awkwardness is all over,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, and remembering that by way of trying not to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had immediately gone to call on Anna, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) blushed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We talk about the peasants drinking; I don't know which drinks most, the peasantry or our own class; the peasants do on holidays, but...''   (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>But Kitty took not the slightest interest in discussing the drinking habits of the peasants.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) blushed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wanted to know why.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and then where did you go?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stiva urged me awfully to go and see Anna Arkadyevna.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said this, Levin blushed even more, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) doubts as to whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had done right in going to see Anna were settled once for all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ought not to have done so.
<p/>Kitty's eyes opened in a curious way and gleamed at Anna's name, but controlling herself with an effort, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) concealed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) emotion and deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you won't be angry at my going.
<p/>Stiva begged me to, and Dolly wished it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin went on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) eyes a constraint that boded him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) no good.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) is a very sweet, very, very unhappy, good woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) about Anna, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) occupations, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is very much to be pitied,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had finished.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom was your letter from?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and believing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) calm tone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) coat.
<p/>Coming back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) found Kitty in the same easy chair.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and broke into sobs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?
<p/>what is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) asked, knowing beforehand what.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're in love with that hateful woman; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has bewitched you!
<p/>I saw it in your eyes.
<p/>Yes, yes!
<p/>What can it all lead to?
<p/>You were drinking at the club, drinking and gambling, and then you went...to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) of all people!
<p/>No, we must go away....
<p/>I shall go away tomorrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a long while before Levin could soothe his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) succeeded in calming her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), only by confessing that a feeling of pity, in conjunction with the wine he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had drunk, had been too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had succumbed to Anna's artful influence, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>One thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did with more sincerity confess to was that living so long in Moscow, a life of nothing but conversation, eating and drinking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was degenerating.
<p/>They talked till three o'clock in the morning.
<p/>Only at three o'clock were they sufficiently reconciled to be able to go to sleep.
<p/>Chapter 12   After taking leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) guests, Anna did not sit down, but began walking up and down the room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had unconsciously the whole evening done her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) utmost to arouse in Levin a feeling of love--as of late she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had fallen into doing with all young men-- and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had attained her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) aim, as far as was possible in one evening, with a married and conscientious man.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) indeed extremely, and, in spite of the striking difference, from the masculine point of view, between Vronsky and Levin, as a woman she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw something they had in common, which had made Kitty able to love both.
<p/>Yet as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was out of the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) ceased to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>One thought, and one only, pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) in different forms, and refused to be shaken off.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I have so much effect on others, on this man, who loves his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, why is it  he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)  is so cold to me?...not cold exactly, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves me, I know that!
<p/>But something new is drawing us apart now.
<p/>Why wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) here all the evening?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told Stiva to say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not leave Yashvin, and must watch over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) play.
<p/>Is Yashvin a child?
<p/>But supposing it's true.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never tells a lie.
<p/>But there's something else in it if it's true.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is glad of an opportunity of showing me that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has other duties; I know that, I submit to that.
<p/>But why prove that to me?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants to show me that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love for me is not to interfere with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) freedom.
<p/>But I need no proofs, I need love.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to understand all the bitterness of this life for me here in Moscow.
<p/>Is this life?
<p/>I am not living, but waiting for an event, which is continually put off and put off.
<p/>No answer again!
<p/>And Stiva says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot go to Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>And I can't write again.
<p/>I can do nothing, can begin nothing, can alter nothing; I hold myself in, I wait, inventing amusements for myself--the English family, writing, reading--but it's all nothing but a sham, it's all the same as morphine.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) ought to feel for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, feeling tears of self-pity coming into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) heard Vronsky's abrupt ring and hurriedly dried her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) tears-- not only dried her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) tears, but sat down by a lamp and opened a book, affecting composure.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wanted to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was displeased that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had not come home as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had promised-- displeased only, and not on any account to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) see her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) distress, and least of all, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) self-pity.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) might pity herself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) must not pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) did not want strife, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) blamed him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) for wanting to quarrel, but unconsciously put herself into an attitude of antagonism.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, eagerly and good-humoredly, going up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a terrible passion it is--gambling!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I've not been dull; I've learned long ago not to be dull.
<p/>Stiva has been here and Levin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they meant to come and see you.
<p/>Well, how did you like Levin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, sitting down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much.
<p/>They have not long been gone.
<p/>What was Yashvin doing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) was winning--seventeen thousand.
<p/>I got him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) had really started home, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) went back again, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>)'s losing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what did you stay for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) asked, suddenly lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes to him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>).
<p/>The expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) face was cold and ungracious.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You told Stiva you were staying on to get Yashvin away.
<p/>And you have left him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The same expression of cold readiness for the conflict appeared on his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) face too.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the first place, I did not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) to give you any message; and secondly, I never tell lies.
<p/>But what's the chief point, I wanted to stay, and I stayed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) said, frowning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna, what is it for, why will you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) said after a moment's silence, bending over towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) hand, hoping she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would lay hers in it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was glad of this appeal for tenderness.
<p/>But some strange force of evil would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) give herself up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) feelings, as though the rules of warfare would not permit her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to surrender.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you wanted to stay, and you stayed.
<p/>You do everything you want to.
<p/>But what do you tell me that for?
<p/>With what object?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, getting more and more excited.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does anyone contest your rights?
<p/>But you want to be right, and you're welcome to be right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hand closed, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) turned away, and his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) face wore a still more obstinate expression.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For you it's a matter of obstinacy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) intently and suddenly finding the right word for that expression that irritated her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``simply obstinacy.
<p/>For you it's a question of whether you keep the upper hand of me, while for me...''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt sorry for herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) almost burst into tears.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you knew what it is for me!
<p/>When I feel as I do now that you are hostile, yes, hostile to me, if you knew what this means for me!

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) turned away, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sobs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what are you talking about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) said, horrified at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) expression of despair, and again bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand and kissed it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it for?

<p/>Don't I avoid the society of women?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes!
<p/>If that were all!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, tell me what I ought to do to give you peace of mind?
<p/>I am ready to do anything to make you happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) said, touched by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) expression of despair; <div class="bookquote">``what wouldn't I do to save you from distress of any sort, as now, Anna!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's nothing, nothing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know myself whether it's the solitary life, my nerves....  Come, don't let us talk of it.
<p/>What about the race?
<p/>You haven't told me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) inquired, trying to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) triumph at the victory, which had anyway been on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) side.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) asked for supper, and began telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) about the races; but in his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) tone, in his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) eyes, which became more and more cold, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) did not forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) victory, that the feeling of obstinacy with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been struggling had asserted itself again in him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) was colder to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) than before, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) were regretting his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) surrender.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), remembering the words that had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) the victory, <div class="bookquote">``how I feel on the brink of calamity, how afraid I am of myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>saw that this weapon was a dangerous one, and that it could not be used a second time.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that beside the love that bound them together there had grown up between them some evil spirit of strife, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not exorcise from his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>), and still less from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own heart.
<p/>Chapter 13   There are no conditions to which a man cannot become used, especially if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees that all around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) are living in the same way.
<p/>Levin could not have believed three months before that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could have gone quietly to sleep in the condition in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was that day, that leading an aimless, irrational life, living too beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) means, after drinking to excess -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not call what happened at the club anything else-RRB-, forming inappropriately friendly relations with a man with whom his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife had once been in love, and a still more inappropriate call upon a woman who could only be called a lost woman, after being fascinated by that woman and causing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife distress--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could still go quietly to sleep.
<p/>But under the influence of fatigue, a sleepless night, and the wine he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had drunk, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleep was sound and untroubled.
<p/>At five o'clock the creak of a door opening waked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jumped up and looked round.
<p/>Kitty was not in bed beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>But there was a light moving behind the screen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) steps.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?...what is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, half-asleep.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kitty!
<p/>What is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, coming from behind the screen with a candle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I felt unwell,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, smiling a particularly sweet and meaning smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?
<p/>has it begun?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said in terror.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We ought to send...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and hurriedly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clothes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, smiling and holding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's sure to be nothing.
<p/>I was rather unwell, only a little.
<p/>It's all over now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And getting into bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) blew out the candle, lay down and was still.
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) stillness suspicious, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) were holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) breath, and still more suspicious the expression of peculiar tenderness and excitement with which, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) came from behind the screen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so sleepy that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell asleep at once.
<p/>Only later he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered the stillness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) breathing, and understood all that must have been passing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sweet, precious heart while she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) lay beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), not stirring, in anticipation of the greatest event in a woman's life.
<p/>At seven o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was waked by the touch of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder, and a gentle whisper.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed struggling between regret at waking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and the desire to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kostya, don't be frightened.
<p/>It's all right.
<p/>But I fancy.... We ought to send for Lizaveta Petrovna.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The candle was lighted again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was sitting up in bed, holding some knitting, which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been busy upon during the last few days.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, don't be frightened, it's all right.
<p/>I'm not a bit afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) scared face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bosom and then to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) hurriedly jumped up, hardly awake, and kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) eyes fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) dressing gown; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) stopped, still looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) had to go, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) could not tear himself from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, knew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) expression, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes, but never had he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) seen it like this.
<p/>How hateful and horrible he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) seemed to himself, thinking of the distress he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) yesterday.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flushed face, fringed with soft curling hair under her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) night cap, was radiant with joy and courage.
<p/>Though there was so little that was complex or artificial in Kitty's character in general, Levin was struck by what was revealed now, when suddenly all disguises were thrown off and the very kernel of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) soul shone in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>And in this simplicity and nakedness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) soul, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), the very woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) loved in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), was more manifest than ever.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), smiling; but all at once her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) brows twitched, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) threw up her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) head, and going quickly up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), clutched his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand and pressed close up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), breathing her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hot breath upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was in pain and was, as it were, complaining to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) suffering.
<p/>And for the first minute, from habit, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was to blame.
<p/>But in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes there was a tenderness that told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was far from reproaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sufferings.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If not I, who is to blame for it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought unconsciously, seeking someone responsible for this suffering for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to punish; but there was no one responsible.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was suffering, complaining, and triumphing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sufferings, and rejoicing in them, and loving them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw that something sublime was being accomplished in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) soul, but what?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not make it out.
<p/>It was beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) understanding.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have sent to mamma.
<p/>You go quickly to fetch Lizaveta Petrovna ...Kostya!...
<p/>Nothing, it's over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) moved away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) and rang the bell.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, go now; Pasha's coming.
<p/>I am all right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>And Levin saw with astonishment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had taken up the knitting she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had brought in in the night and begun working at it again.
<p/>As Levin was going out of one door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard the maid-servant come in at the other.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stood at the door and heard Kitty giving exact directions to the maid, and beginning to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) move the bedstead.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dressed, and while they were putting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) horses, as a hired sledge was not to be seen yet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ran again up to the bedroom, not on tiptoe, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), but on wings.
<p/>Two maid-servants were carefully moving something in the bedroom.
<p/>Kitty was walking about knitting rapidly and giving directions.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going for the doctor.
<p/>They have sent for Lizaveta Petrovna, but I'll go on there too.
<p/>Isn't there anything wanted?
<p/>Yes, shall I go to Dolly's?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), obviously not hearing what he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was saying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes.
<p/>Do go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said quickly, frowning and waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had just gone into the drawing room, when suddenly a plaintive moan sounded from the bedroom, smothered instantly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) stood still, and for a long while he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) could not understand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that is she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said to himself, and clutching at his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) ran downstairs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord have mercy on us!
<p/>pardon us!
<p/>aid us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) repeated the words that for some reason came suddenly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lips.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), an unbeliever, repeated these words not with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lips only.
<p/>At that instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) knew that all his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) doubts, even the impossibility of believing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) reason, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was aware in himself, did not in the least hinder his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) turning to God.
<p/>All of that now floated out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) soul like dust.
<p/>To whom was he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to turn if not to Him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) in whose hands he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) felt himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) soul, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) love?
<p/>The horse was not yet ready, but feeling a peculiar concentration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) physical forces and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) intellect on what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) started off on foot without waiting for the horse, and told Kouzma to overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>).
<p/>At the corner he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) met a night cabman driving hurriedly.
<p/>In the little sledge, wrapped in a velvet cloak, sat Lizaveta Petrovna with a kerchief round her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God!
<p/>thank God!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, overjoyed to recognize her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) little fair face which wore a peculiarly serious, even stern expression.
<p/>Telling the driver not to stop, he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) ran along beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For two hours, then?
<p/>Not more?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) inquired.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should let Pyotr Dmitrievitch know, but don't hurry him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>).
<p/>And get some opium at the chemist's.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you think that it may go on well?
<p/>Lord have mercy on us and help us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin said, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own horse driving out of the gate.
<p/>Jumping into the sledge beside Kouzma, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to drive to the doctor's.
<p/>Chapter 14   The doctor was not yet up, and the footman said that <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) had been up late, and had given orders not to be waked, but would get up soon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the footman</b></font>)</div><p/>The footman was cleaning the lamp-chimneys, and seemed very busy about them.
<p/>This concentration of the footman upon his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) lamps, and his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) indifference to what was passing in Levin, at first astounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), but immediately on considering the question he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) realized that no one knew or was bound to know his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) feelings, and that it was all the more necessary to act calmly, sensibly, and resolutely to get through this wall of indifference and attain his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) aim.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be in a hurry or let anything slip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin said to himself, feeling a greater and greater flow of physical energy and attention to all that lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to do.
<p/>Having ascertained that the doctor was not getting up, Levin considered various plans, and decided on the following one: that Kouzma should go for another doctor, while he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) himself should go to the chemist's for opium, and if when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) came back the doctor had not yet begun to get up, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would either by tipping the footman, or by force, wake the doctor at all hazards.
<p/>At the chemist's the lank shopman sealed up a packet of powders for a coachman who stood waiting, and refused him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) opium with the same callousness with which the doctor's footman had cleaned his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) lamp chimneys.
<p/>Trying not to get flurried or out of temper, Levin mentioned the names of the doctor and midwife, and explaining what the opium was needed for, tried to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>The assistant inquired in German whether he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) should give it, and receiving an affirmative reply from behind the partition, he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) took out a bottle and a funnel, deliberately poured the opium from a bigger bottle into a little one, stuck on a label, sealed it up, in spite of Levin's request that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would not do so, and was about to wrap it up too.
<p/>This was more than Levin could stand; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took the bottle firmly out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands, and ran to the big glass doors.
<p/>The doctor was not even now getting up, and the footman, busy now in putting down the rugs, refused to wake him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>).
<p/>Levin deliberately took out a ten rouble note, and, careful to speak slowly, though losing no time over the business, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) the note, and explained that Pyotr Dmitrievitch -LRB-what a great and important personage he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) seemed to Levin now, this Pyotr Dmitrievitch, who had been of so little consequence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes before!-RRB-
<p/>had promised to come at any time; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would certainly not be angry!
<p/>and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must therefore wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) at once.
<p/>The footman agreed, and went upstairs, taking Levin into the waiting room.
<p/>Levin could hear through the door the doctor coughing, moving about, washing, and saying something.
<p/>Three minutes passed; it seemed to Levin that more than an hour had gone by.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not wait any longer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pyotr Dmitrievitch, Pyotr Dmitrievitch!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said in an imploring voice at the open door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For God's sake, forgive me!
<p/>See me as you are.
<p/>It's been going on more than two hours already.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a minute; in a minute!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>answered a voice, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) amazement Levin heard that the doctor was smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) spoke.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For one instant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a minute.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Two minutes more passed while the doctor was putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) boots, and two minutes more while the doctor put on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) coat and combed his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pyotr Dmitrievitch!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin was beginning again in a plaintive voice, just as the doctor came in dressed and ready.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``These people have no conscience,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>thought Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Combing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hair, while we're dying!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>the doctor said to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), shaking hands, and, as it were, teasing him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) composure.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no hurry.
<p/>Well now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Trying to be as accurate as possible, Levin began to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) every unnecessary detail of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife's condition, interrupting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) account repeatedly with entreaties that the doctor would come with him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) at once.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you needn't be in any hurry.
<p/>You don't understand, you know.
<p/>I'm certain I'm not wanted, still I've promised, and if you like, I'll come.
<p/>But there's no hurry.
<p/>Please sit down; won't you have some coffee?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) with eyes that asked whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was laughing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>); but the doctor had no notion of making fun of him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>the doctor said, smiling; <div class="bookquote">``I'm a married man myself; and at these moments we husbands are very much to be pitied.
<p/>I've a patient whose husband always takes refuge in the stables on such occasions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what do you think, Pyotr Dmitrievitch?
<p/>Do you suppose it may go all right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything points to a favorable issue.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you'll come immediately?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, looking wrathfully at the servant who was bringing in the coffee.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In an hour's time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, for mercy's sake!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let me drink my coffee, anyway.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The doctor started upon his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) coffee.
<p/>Both were silent.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Turks are really getting beaten, though.
<p/>Did you read yesterday's telegrams?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>said the doctor, munching some roll.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I can't stand it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, jumping up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you'll be with us in a quarter of an hour.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In half an hour.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On your honor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>When Levin got home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drove up at the same time as the princess, and they went up to the bedroom door together.
<p/>The princess had tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) eyes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) hands were shaking.
<p/>Seeing Levin, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and burst into tears.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear Lizaveta Petrovna?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) queried, clasping the hand of the midwife, who came out to meet them with a beaming and anxious face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)'s going on well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) to lie down.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) will be easier so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>From the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had waked up and understood what was going on, Levin had prepared his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind to bear resolutely what was before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and without considering or anticipating anything, to avoid upsetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife, and on the contrary to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and keep up her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) courage.
<p/>Without allowing himself even to think of what was to come, of how it would end, judging from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) inquiries as to the usual duration of these ordeals, Levin had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) imagination braced himself to bear up and to keep a tight rein on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) feelings for five hours, and it had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could do this.
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) came back from the doctor's and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sufferings again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fell to repeating more and more frequently: <div class="bookquote">``Lord, have mercy on us, and succor us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) sighed, and flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) head up, and began to feel afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) could not bear it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) would burst into tears or run away.
<p/>Such agony it was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>).
<p/>And only one hour had passed.
<p/>But after that hour there passed another hour, two hours, three, the full five hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had fixed as the furthest limit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) sufferings, and the position was still unchanged; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was still bearing it because there was nothing to be done but bear it; every instant feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had reached the utmost limits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) endurance, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) heart would break with sympathy and pain.
<p/>But still the minutes passed by and the hours, and still hours more, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) misery and horror grew and were more and more intense.
<p/>All the ordinary conditions of life, without which one can form no conception of anything, had ceased to exist for Levin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lost all sense of time.
<p/>Minutes--those minutes when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) moist hand, that would squeeze his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand with extraordinary violence and then push it away--seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hours, and hours seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) minutes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was surprised when Lizaveta Petrovna asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to light a candle behind a screen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) found that it was five o'clock in the afternoon.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been told it was only ten o'clock in the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would not have been more surprised.
<p/>Where he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was all this time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew as little as the time of anything.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) swollen face, sometimes bewildered and in agony, sometimes smiling and trying to reassure him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw the old princess too, flushed and overwrought, with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) gray curls in disorder, forcing herself to gulp down her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) tears, biting her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) lips; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw Dolly too and the doctor, smoking fat cigarettes, and Lizaveta Petrovna with a firm, resolute, reassuring face, and the old prince walking up and down the hall with a frowning face.
<p/>But why they came in and went out, where they were, he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) did not know.
<p/>The princess was with the doctor in the bedroom, then in the study, where a table set for dinner suddenly appeared; then she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was not there, but Dolly was.
<p/>Then Levin remembered he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been sent somewhere.
<p/>Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been sent to move a table and sofa.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had done this eagerly, thinking it had to be done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) sake, and only later on he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) found it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own bed he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been getting ready.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been sent to the study to ask the doctor something.
<p/>The doctor had answered and then had said something about the irregularities in the municipal council.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had been sent to the bedroom to help the old princess to move the holy picture in its silver and gold setting, and with the princess's old waiting maid he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had clambered on a shelf to reach it and had broken the little lamp, and the old servant had tried to reassure him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) about the lamp and about his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) wife, and he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) carried the holy picture and set it at Kitty's head, carefully tucking it in behind the pillow.
<p/>But where, when, and why all this had happened, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) could not tell.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) did not understand why the old princess took his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) hand, and looking compassionately at him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), begged him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) not to worry himself, and Dolly persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to eat something and led him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) out of the room, and even the doctor looked seriously and with commiseration at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) and offered him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) a drop of something.
<p/>All he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) knew and felt was that what was happening was what had happened nearly a year before in the hotel of the country town at the deathbed of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) brother Nikolay.
<p/>But that had been grief-- this was joy.
<p/>Yet that grief and this joy were alike outside all the ordinary conditions of life; they were loop-holes, as it were, in that ordinary life through which there came glimpses of something sublime.
<p/>And in the contemplation of this sublime something the soul was exalted to inconceivable heights of which it had before had no conception, while reason lagged behind, unable to keep up with it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, have mercy on us, and succor us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) repeated to himself incessantly, feeling, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) long and, as it seemed, complete alienation from religion, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) turned to God just as trustfully and simply as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) childhood and first youth.
<p/>All this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had two distinct spiritual conditions.
<p/>One was away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), with the doctor, who kept smoking one fat cigarette after another and extinguishing them on the edge of a full ash tray, with Dolly, and with the old prince, where there was talk about dinner, about politics, about Marya Petrovna's illness, and where Levin suddenly forgot for a minute what was happening, and felt as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had waked up from sleep; the other was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) presence, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) pillow, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart seemed breaking and still did not break from sympathetic suffering, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) prayed to God without ceasing.
<p/>And every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was brought back from a moment of oblivion by a scream reaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) from the bedroom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fell into the same strange terror that had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) the first minute.
<p/>Every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard a shriek, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) jumped up, ran to justify himself, remembered on the way that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not to blame, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) longed to defend her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw again that help was impossible, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was filled with terror and prayed: <div class="bookquote">``Lord, have mercy on us, and help us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And as time went on, both these conditions became more intense; the calmer he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) became away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), completely forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), the more agonizing became both her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) sufferings and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) feeling of helplessness before them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) jumped up, would have liked to run away, but ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/>Sometimes, when again and again she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) called upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) blamed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>); but seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) patient, smiling face, and hearing the words, <div class="bookquote">``I am worrying you,''  (<font color='red'><b>patient</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) threw the blame on God; but thinking of God, at once he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fell to beseeching God to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and have mercy.
<p/>Chapter 15   He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not know whether it was late or early.
<p/>The candles had all burned out.
<p/>Dolly had just been in the study and had suggested to the doctor that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) should lie down.
<p/>Levin sat listening to the doctor's stories of a quack mesmerizer and looking at the ashes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) cigarette.
<p/>There had been a period of repose, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had sunk into oblivion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had completely forgotten what was going on now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard the doctor's chat and understood it.
<p/>Suddenly there came an unearthly shriek.
<p/>The shriek was so awful that Levin did not even jump up, but holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) breath, gazed in terrified inquiry at the doctor.
<p/>The doctor put his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head on one side, listened, and smiled approvingly.
<p/>Everything was so extraordinary that nothing could strike Levin as strange.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it must be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought, and still sat where he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was.
<p/>Whose scream was this?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) jumped up, ran on tiptoe to the bedroom, edged round Lizaveta Petrovna and the princess, and took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) position at Kitty's pillow.
<p/>The scream had subsided, but there was some change now.
<p/>What it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not see and did not comprehend, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had no wish to see or comprehend.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw it by the face of Lizaveta Petrovna.
<p/>Lizaveta Petrovna's face was stern and pale, and still as resolute, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) jaws were twitching, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes were fixed intently on Kitty.
<p/>Kitty's swollen and agonized face, a tress of hair clinging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) moist brow, was turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and sought his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) lifted hands asked for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) chill hands in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) moist ones, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) began squeezing them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't go, don't go!
<p/>I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said rapidly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, take my earrings.
<p/>They bother me.
<p/>You're not afraid?
<p/>Quick, quick, Lizaveta Petrovna...''   (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) spoke quickly, very quickly, and tried to smile.
<p/>But suddenly her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) face was drawn, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, this is awful!
<p/>I'm dying, I'm dying!
<p/>Go away!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) shrieked, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard that unearthly scream.
<p/>Levin clutched at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head and ran out of the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's nothing, it's nothing, it's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>Dolly called after him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>But they might say what they liked, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew now that all was over.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stood in the next room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head leaning against the door post, and heard shrieks, howls such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had never heard before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew that what had been Kitty was uttering these shrieks.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had long ago ceased to wish for the child.
<p/>By now he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) loathed this child.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not even wish for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) life now, all he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) longed for was the end of this awful anguish.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doctor!
<p/>What is it?
<p/>What is it?
<p/>By God!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, snatching at the doctor's hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) came up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the end,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.
<p/>And the doctor's face was so grave as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said it that Levin took  the end  as meaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) death.
<p/>Beside himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ran into the bedroom.
<p/>The first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw was the face of Lizaveta Petrovna.
<p/>It was even more frowning and stern.
<p/>Kitty's face he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not know.
<p/>In the place where it had been was something that was fearful in its strained distortion and in the sounds that came from it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fell down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head on the wooden framework of the bed, feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart was bursting.
<p/>The awful scream never paused, it became still more awful, and as though it had reached the utmost limit of terror, suddenly it ceased.
<p/>Levin could not believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ears, but there could be no doubt; the scream had ceased and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard a subdued stir and bustle, and hurried breathing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) voice, gasping, alive, tender, and blissful, uttered softly, <div class="bookquote">``It's over!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head.
<p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands hanging exhausted on the quilt, looking extraordinarily lovely and serene, she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in silence and tried to smile, and could not.
<p/>And suddenly, from the mysterious and awful far-away world in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been living for the last twenty-two hours, Levin felt himself all in an instant borne back to the old every-day world, glorified though now, by such a radiance of happiness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not bear it.
<p/>The strained chords snapped, sobs and tears of joy which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had never foreseen rose up with such violence that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) whole body shook, that for long they prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) from speaking.
<p/>Falling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knees before the bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife's hand before his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lips and kissed it, and the hand, with a weak movement of the fingers, responded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) kiss.
<p/>And meanwhile, there at the foot of the bed, in the deft hands of Lizaveta Petrovna, like a flickering light in a lamp, lay the life of a human creature, which had never existed before, and which would now with the same right, with the same importance to itself, live and create in its own image.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alive!
<p/>alive!
<p/>And a boy too!
<p/>Set your mind at rest!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin heard Lizaveta Petrovna saying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) slapped the baby's back with a shaking hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, is it true?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div><p/>said Kitty's voice.
<p/>The princess's sobs were all the answers she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could make.
<p/>And in the midst of the silence there came in unmistakable reply to the mother's question, a voice quite unlike the subdued voices speaking in the room.
<p/>It was the bold, clamorous, self-assertive squall of the new human being, who had so incomprehensibly appeared.
<p/>If Levin had been told before that Kitty was dead, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had died with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and that their children were angels, and that God was standing before him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would have been surprised at nothing.
<p/>But now, coming back to the world of reality, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had to make great mental efforts to take in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was alive and well, and that the creature squalling so desperately was his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) son.
<p/>Kitty was alive, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) agony was over.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was unutterably happy.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) understood; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was completely happy in it.
<p/>But the baby?
<p/>Whence, why, who was he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could not get used to the idea.
<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) something extraneous, superfluous, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could not accustom himself.
<p/>Chapter 16   At ten o'clock the old prince, Sergey Ivanovitch, and Stepan Arkadyevitch were sitting at Levin's.
<p/>Having inquired after Kitty, they had dropped into conversation upon other subjects.
<p/>Levin heard them, and unconsciously, as they talked, going over the past, over what had been up to that morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought of himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been yesterday till that point.
<p/>It was as though a hundred years had passed since then.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt himself exalted to unattainable heights, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) studiously lowered himself so as not to wound the people he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was talking to.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) talked, and was all the time thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife, of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) condition now, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) son, in whose existence he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tried to school himself into believing.
<p/>The whole world of woman, which had taken for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) since his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) marriage a new value he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had never suspected before, was now so exalted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not take it in in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) imagination.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard them talk of yesterday's dinner at the club, and thought: <div class="bookquote">``What is happening with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now?
<p/>Is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asleep?
<p/>How is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?
<p/>What is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thinking of?
<p/>Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) crying, my son Dmitri?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>And in the middle of the conversation, in the middle of a sentence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) jumped up and went out of the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Send me word if I can see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div>said the prince.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, in a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin, and without stopping, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not asleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was talking gently with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother, making plans about the christening.
<p/>Carefully set to rights, with hair well-brushed, in a smart little cap with some blue in it, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms out on the quilt, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was lying on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back.
<p/>Meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, bright before, brightened still more as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drew near her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>There was the same change in it from earthly to unearthly that is seen in the face of the dead.
<p/>But then it means farewell, here it meant welcome.
<p/>Again a rush of emotion, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had felt at the moment of the child's birth, flooded his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hand and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had slept.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not answer, and turned away, struggling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) weakness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had a nap, Kostya!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``and I am so comfortable now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>), but suddenly her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) expression changed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, hearing the baby's cry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) to me, Lizaveta Petrovna, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) shall look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) papa shall look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lizaveta Petrovna</b></font>)</div>said Lizaveta Petrovna, getting up and bringing something red, and queer, and wriggling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute, we'll make him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) tidy first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lizaveta Petrovna</b></font>)</div>and Lizaveta Petrovna laid the red wobbling thing on the bed, began untrussing and trussing up the baby, lifting it up and turning it over with one finger and powdering it with something.
<p/>Levin, looking at the tiny, pitiful creature, made strenuous efforts to discover in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart some traces of fatherly feeling for it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt nothing towards it but disgust.
<p/>But when it was undressed and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) caught a glimpse of wee, wee, little hands, little feet, saffron-colored, with little toes, too, and positively with a little big toe different from the rest, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw Lizaveta Petrovna closing the wide-open little hands, as though they were soft springs, and putting them into linen garments, such pity for the little creature came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and such terror that she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would hurt it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hand back.
<p/>Lizaveta Petrovna laughed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be frightened, don't be frightened!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the baby</b></font>)</div><p/>When the baby had been put to rights and transformed into a firm doll, Lizaveta Petrovna dandled it as though proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) handiwork, and stood a little away so that Levin might see his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) son in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) glory.
<p/>Kitty looked sideways in the same direction, never taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) eyes off the baby.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to me!
<p/>give him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, and even made as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) would sit up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you thinking of, Katerina Alexandrovna, you mustn't move like that!
<p/>Wait a minute.
<p/>I'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to you.
<p/>Here we're showing papa what a fine fellow we are!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lizaveta Petrovna</b></font>)</div><p/>And Lizaveta Petrovna, with one hand supporting the wobbling head, lifted up on the other arm the strange, limp, red creature, whose head was lost in its swaddling clothes.
<p/>But it had a nose, too, and slanting eyes and smacking lips.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A splendid baby!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lizaveta Petrovna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Lizaveta Petrovna.
<p/>Levin sighed with mortification.
<p/>This splendid baby excited in him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) no feeling but disgust and compassion.
<p/>It was not at all the feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had looked forward to.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) turned away while Lizaveta Petrovna put the baby to the unaccustomed breast.
<p/>Suddenly laughter made him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) look round.
<p/>The baby had taken the breast.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, that's enough, that's enough!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lizaveta Petrovna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Lizaveta Petrovna, but Kitty would not let the baby go.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fell asleep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) arms.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty, turning the baby so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could see it.
<p/>The aged-looking little face suddenly puckered up still more and the baby sneezed.
<p/>Smiling, hardly able to restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tears, Levin kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife and went out of the dark room.
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt towards this little creature was utterly unlike what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had expected.
<p/>There was nothing cheerful and joyous in the feeling; on the contrary, it was a new torture of apprehension.
<p/>It was the consciousness of a new sphere of liability to pain.
<p/>And this sense was so painful at first, the apprehension lest this helpless creature should suffer was so intense, that it prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) from noticing the strange thrill of senseless joy and even pride that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had felt when the baby sneezed.
<p/>Chapter 17   Stepan Arkadyevitch's affairs were in a very bad way.
<p/>The money for two-thirds of the forest had all been spent already, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had borrowed from the merchant in advance at ten per cent discount, almost all the remaining third.
<p/>The  merchant would not give more, especially as Darya Alexandrovna, for the first time that winter insisting on her (<font color='blue'><b>baby</b></font>) right to her (<font color='blue'><b>baby</b></font>) own property, had refused to sign the receipt for the payment of the last third of the forest.
<p/>All his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) salary went on household expenses and in payment of petty debts that could not be put off.
<p/>There was positively no money.
<p/>This was unpleasant and awkward, and in Stepan Arkadyevitch's opinion things could not go on like this.
<p/>The explanation of the position was, in his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) view, to be found in the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) salary was too small.
<p/>The post he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) filled had been unmistakably very good five years ago, but it was so no longer.
<p/>Petrov, the bank director, had twelve thousand; Sventitsky, a company director, had seventeen thousand; Mitin, who had founded a bank, received fifty thousand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clearly I've been napping, and they've overlooked me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>Stepan Arkadyevitch thought about himself.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) began keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) eyes and ears open, and towards the end of the winter he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) had discovered a very good berth and had formed a plan of attack upon it, at first from Moscow through aunts, uncles, and friends, and then, when the matter was well advanced, in the spring, he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) went himself to Petersburg.
<p/>It was one of those snug, lucrative berths of which there are so many more nowadays than there used to be, with incomes ranging from one thousand to fifty thousand roubles.
<p/>It was the post of secretary of the committee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways, and of certain banking companies.
<p/>This position, like all such appointments, called for such immense energy and such varied qualifications, that it was difficult for them to be found united in any one man.
<p/>And since a man combining all the qualifications was not to be found, it was at least better that the post be filled by an honest than by a dishonest man.
<p/>And Stepan Arkadyevitch was not merely an honest man--unemphatically--in the common acceptation of the words, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an honest man--emphatically--in that special sense which the word has in Moscow, when they talk of an <div class="bookquote">``honest''  (<font color='red'><b>an man writer newspaper institution tendency</b></font>)</div>politician, an <div class="bookquote">``honest''  (<font color='red'><b>an politician</b></font>)</div>writer, an <div class="bookquote">``honest''  (<font color='red'><b>an writer</b></font>)</div>newspaper, an <div class="bookquote">``honest''  (<font color='red'><b>an writer</b></font>)</div>institution, an <div class="bookquote">``honest''  (<font color='red'><b>an writer</b></font>)</div>tendency, meaning not simply that the man or the institution is not dishonest, but that they are capable on occasion of taking a line of their own in opposition to the authorities.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch moved in those circles in Moscow in which that expression had come into use, was regarded there as an honest man, and so had more right to this appointment than others.
<p/>The appointment yielded an income of from seven to ten thousand a year, and Oblonsky could fill it without giving up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) government position.
<p/>It was in the hands of two ministers, one lady, and two Jews, and all these people, though the way had been paved already with them, Stepan Arkadyevitch had to see in Petersburg.
<p/>Besides this business, Stepan Arkadyevitch had promised his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister Anna to obtain from Karenin a definite answer on the question of divorce.
<p/>And begging fifty roubles from Dolly, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set off for Petersburg.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch sat in Karenin's study listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) report on the causes of the unsatisfactory position of Russian finance, and only waiting for the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) would finish to speak about his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) own business or about Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) said, when Alexey Alexandrovitch took off the pince-nez, without which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not read now, and looked inquiringly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) former brother-in-law, <div class="bookquote">``that's very true in particular cases, but still the principle of our day is freedom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I lay down another principle, embracing the principle of freedom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch, with emphasis on the word <div class="bookquote">``embracing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) pince-nez again, so as to read the passage in which this statement was made.
<p/>And turning over the beautifully written, wide-margined manuscript, Alexey Alexandrovitch read aloud over again the conclusive passage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't advocate protection for the sake of private interests, but for the public weal, and for the lower and upper classes equally,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) pince-nez at Oblonsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But they  cannot grasp that,  they  are taken up now with personal interests, and carried away by phrases.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch knew that when Karenin began to talk of what they  were doing and thinking, the persons who would not accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) report and were the cause of everything wrong in Russia, that it was coming near the end.
<p/>And so now he (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) eagerly abandoned the principle of free-trade, and fully agreed.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch paused, thoughtfully turning over the pages of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) manuscript.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, by the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to ask you, some time when you see Pomorsky, to drop him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) a hint that I should be very glad to get that new appointment of secretary of the committee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways and banking companies.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch was familiar by now with the title of the post he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) coveted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) brought it out rapidly without mistake.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) as to the duties of this new committee, and pondered.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was considering whether the new committee would not be acting in some way contrary to the views he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had been advocating.
<p/>But as the influence of the new committee was of a very complex nature, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) views were of very wide application, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not decide this straight off, and taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) pince-nez, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said:  <div class="bookquote">``Of course, I can mention it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>); but what is your reason precisely for wishing to obtain the appointment?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a good salary, rising to nine thousand, and my means...''   (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nine thousand!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>repeated Alexey Alexandrovitch, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) frowned.
<p/>The high figure of the salary made him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) reflect that on that side Stepan Arkadyevitch's proposed position ran counter to the main tendency of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) own projects of reform, which always leaned towards economy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I consider, and I have embodied my views in a note on the subject, that in our day these immense salaries are evidence of the unsound economic  assiette  of our finances.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what's to be done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose a bank director gets ten thousand--well, he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>)'s worth it; or an engineer gets twenty thousand--after all, it's a growing thing, you know!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I assume that a salary is the price paid for a commodity, and it ought to conform with the law of supply and demand.
<p/>If the salary is fixed without any regard for that law, as, for instance, when I see two engineers leaving college together, both equally well trained and efficient, and one getting forty thousand while the other is satisfied with two; or when I see lawyers and hussars, having no special qualifications, appointed directors of banking companies with immense salaries, I conclude that the salary is not fixed in accordance with the law of supply and demand, but simply through personal interest.
<p/>And this is an abuse of great gravity in itself, and one that reacts injuriously on the government service.
<p/>I consider...''   (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>Stepan Arkadyevitch made haste to interrupt his (<font color='blue'><b>hussars</b></font>) brother-in-law.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but you must agree that it's a new institution of undoubted utility that's being started.
<p/>After all, you know, it's a growing thing!
<p/>What they lay particular stress on is the thing being carried on honestly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch with emphasis.
<p/>But the Moscow significance of the word <div class="bookquote">``honest''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>was lost on Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Honesty is only a negative qualification,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you'll do me a great service, anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, <div class="bookquote">``by putting in a word to Pomorsky--just in the way of conversation...''   (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I fancy it's more in Volgarinov's hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Volgarinov has fully assented, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)'s concerned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, turning red.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch reddened at the mention of that name, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had been that morning at the Jew Volgarinov's, and the visit had left an unpleasant recollection.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch believed most positively that the committee in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was trying to get an appointment was a new, genuine, and honest public body, but that morning when Volgarinov had-- intentionally, beyond a doubt--kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) two hours waiting with other petitioners in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) waiting room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had suddenly felt uneasy.
<p/>Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was uncomfortable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), a descendant of Rurik, Prince Oblonsky, had been kept for two hours waiting to see a Jew, or that for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was not following the example of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) ancestors in serving the government, but was turning off into a new career, anyway he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was very uncomfortable.
<p/>During those two hours in Volgarinov's waiting room Stepan Arkadyevitch, stepping jauntily about the room, pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) whiskers, entering into conversation with the other petitioners, and inventing an epigram on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) position, assiduously concealed from others, and even from himself, the feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was experiencing.
<p/>But all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was uncomfortable and angry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) could not have said why--whether because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) could not get his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) epigram just right, or from some other reason.
<p/>When at last Volgarinov had received him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) with exaggerated politeness and unmistakable triumph at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) humiliation, and had all but refused the favor asked of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), Stepan Arkadyevitch had made haste to forget it all as soon as possible.
<p/>And now, at the mere recollection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) blushed.
<p/>Chapter 18   <div class="bookquote">``Now there is something I want to talk about, and you know what it is.
<p/>About Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>Stepan Arkadyevitch said, pausing for a brief space, and shaking off the unpleasant impression.
<p/>As soon as Oblonsky uttered Anna's name, the face of Alexey Alexandrovitch was completely transformed; all the life was gone out of it, and it looked weary and dead.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it exactly that you want from me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) said, moving in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) chair and snapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) pince-nez.

<p/>If you will allow me to recapitulate, it was like this: when you parted, you were as magnanimous as could possibly be; you were ready to give her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) everything--freedom, divorce even.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) appreciated that.
<p/>No, don't think that.

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch knew what was meant by that <div class="bookquote">``if it were possible,'' (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>--if it were possible to arrange the divorce so as to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) have her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son....

<p/>The boy looked healthy and good-humored.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bowed to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) uncle as to a stranger, but recognizing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) blushed and turned hurriedly away from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), as though offended and irritated at something.
<p/>The boy went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father and handed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a note of the marks he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had gained in school.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's very fair,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">``you can go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s thinner and taller, and has grown out of being a child into a boy; I like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy looked back quickly at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) uncle.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,  mon oncle ,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) answered, glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked downcast.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) uncle called him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and took his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and how are you getting on?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, wanting to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and not knowing what to say.
<p/>The boy, blushing and making no answer, cautiously drew his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand away.
<p/>As soon as Stepan Arkadyevitch let go his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) glanced doubtfully at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, and like a bird set free, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) darted out of the room.
<p/>A year had passed since the last time Seryozha had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother.
<p/>Since then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had heard nothing more of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>And in the course of that year he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had gone to school, and made friends among his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) schoolfellows.
<p/>The dreams and memories of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother, which had made him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ill after seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), did not occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thoughts now.
<p/>When they came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) studiously drove them away, regarding them as shameful and girlish, below the dignity of a boy and a schoolboy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father and mother were separated by some quarrel, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had to remain with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tried to get used to that idea.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) disliked seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) uncle, so like his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother, for it called up those memories of which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was ashamed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) disliked it all the more as from some words he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had caught as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) waited at the study door, and still more from the faces of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father and uncle, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) guessed that they must have been talking of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother.
<p/>And to avoid condemning the father with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lived and on whom he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was dependent, and, above all, to avoid giving way to sentimentality, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) considered so degrading, Seryozha tried not to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) uncle who had come to disturb his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) peace of mind, and not to think of what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) recalled to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>But when Stepan Arkadyevitch, going out after him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on the stairs, and calling to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), asked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spent his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) playtime at school, Seryozha talked more freely to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) away from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father's presence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have a railway now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said in answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) uncle's question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's like this, do you see: two sit on a bench-- they're the passengers; and one stands up straight on the bench.
<p/>And all are harnessed to it by their arms or by their belts, and they run through all the rooms--the doors are left open beforehand.
<p/>Well, and it's pretty hard work being the conductor!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the one that stands?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch inquired, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you want pluck for it, and cleverness too, especially when they stop all of a sudden, or someone falls down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that must be a serious matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, watching with mournful interest the eager eyes, like his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) mother's; not childish now--no longer fully innocent.
<p/>And though he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) had promised Alexey Alexandrovitch not to speak of Anna, he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) could not restrain himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember your mother?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) asked suddenly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seryozha</b></font>)</div>Seryozha said quickly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) blushed crimson, and his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) face clouded over.
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) uncle could get nothing more out of him (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) tutor found his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) pupil on the staircase half an hour later, and for a long while he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) could not make out whether he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) was ill-tempered or crying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?
<p/>I expect you hurt yourself when you fell down?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the tutor</b></font>)</div><p/>said the tutor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you it was a dangerous game.
<p/>And we shall have to speak to the director.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had hurt myself, nobody should have found it out, that's certain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what is it, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave me alone!
<p/>If I remember, or if I don't remember?...what business is it of his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>)?
<p/>Why should I remember?
<p/>Leave me in peace!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) said, addressing not his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) tutor, but the whole world.
<p/>Chapter 20   Stepan Arkadyevitch, as usual, did not waste his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) time in Petersburg.
<p/>In Petersburg, besides business, his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) sister's divorce, and his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) coveted appointment, he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) wanted, as he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) always did, to freshen himself up, as he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) said, after the mustiness of Moscow.
<p/>In spite of its  caf√©s chantants  and its omnibuses, Moscow was yet a stagnant bog.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch always felt it.
<p/>After living for some time in Moscow, especially in close relations with his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) family, he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) was conscious of a depression of spirits.
<p/>After being a long time in Moscow without a change, he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) reached a point when he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) positively began to be worrying himself over his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) wife's ill-humor and reproaches, over his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) children's health and education, and the petty details of his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) official work; even the fact of being in debt worried him (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>).
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) had only to go and stay a little while in Petersburg, in the circle there in which he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) moved, where people lived--really lived--instead of vegetating as in Moscow, and all such ideas vanished and melted away at once, like wax before the fire.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) wife?...
<p/>Only that day he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) had been talking to Prince Tchetchensky.
<p/>Prince Tchetchensky had a wife and family, grown-up pages in the corps,...and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>) had another illegitimate family of children also.
<p/>Though the first family was very nice too, Prince Tchetchensky felt happier in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>) second family; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>) used to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>) eldest son with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>) second family, and told Stepan Arkadyevitch that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>) thought it good for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>) son, enlarging his (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>) ideas.
<p/>What would have been said to that in Moscow?
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tchetchensky</b></font>) children?
<p/>In Petersburg children did not prevent their parents from enjoying life.
<p/>The children were brought up in schools, and there was no trace of the wild idea that prevailed in Moscow, in Lvov's household, for instance, that all the luxuries of life were for the children, while the parents have nothing but work and anxiety.
<p/>Here people understood that a man is in duty bound to live for himself, as every man of culture should live.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) official duties?
<p/>Official work here was not the stiff, hopeless drudgery that it was in Moscow.
<p/>Here there was some interest in official life.
<p/>A chance meeting, a service rendered, a happy phrase, a knack of facetious mimicry, and a man's career might be made in a trice.
<p/>So it had been with Bryantsev, whom Stepan Arkadyevitch had met the previous day, and who was one of the highest functionaries in government now.
<p/>There was some interest in official work like that.
<p/>The Petersburg attitude on pecuniary matters had an especially soothing effect on Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>Bartnyansky, who must spend at least fifty thousand to judge by the style he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lived in, had made an interesting comment the day before on that subject.
<p/>As they were talking before dinner, Stepan Arkadyevitch said to Bartnyansky:  <div class="bookquote">``You're friendly, I fancy, with Mordvinsky; you might do me a favor: say a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), please, for me.
<p/>There's an appointment I should like to get--secretary of the agency...''   (<font color='red'><b>Bartnyansky</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I shan't remember all that, if you tell it to me....
<p/>But what possesses you to have to do with railways and Jews?...
<p/>Take it as you will, it's a low business.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch did not say to Bartnyansky that it was a <div class="bookquote">``growing thing'' (<font color='red'><b>Bartnyansky</b></font>)</div>--Bartnyansky would not have understood that.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want the money, I've nothing to live on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're living, aren't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but in debt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you, though?
<p/>Heavily?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bartnyansky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Bartnyansky sympathetically.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very heavily: twenty thousand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bartnyansky</b></font>)</div><p/>Bartnyansky broke into good-humored laughter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, lucky fellow!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My debts mount up to a million and a half, and I've nothing, and still I can live, as you see!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>And Stepan Arkadyevitch saw the correctness of this view not in words only but in actual fact.
<p/>Zhivahov owed three hundred thousand, and hadn't a farthing to bless himself with, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) lived, and in style too!
<p/>Count Krivtsov was considered a hopeless case by everyone, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) kept two mistresses.
<p/>Petrovsky had run through five millions, and still lived in just the same style, and was even a manager in the financial department with a salary of twenty thousand.
<p/>But besides this, Petersburg had physically an agreeable effect on Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>It made him (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) younger.
<p/>In Moscow he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) sometimes found a gray hair in his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) head, dropped asleep after dinner, stretched, walked slowly upstairs, breathing heavily, was bored by the society of young women, and did not dance at balls.
<p/>In Petersburg he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) always felt ten years younger.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) experience in Petersburg was exactly what had been described to him (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) on the previous day by Prince Pyotr Oblonsky, a man of sixty, who had just come back from abroad:  <div class="bookquote">``We don't know the way to live here,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said Pyotr Oblonsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I spent the summer in Baden, and you wouldn't believe it, I felt quite a young man.
<p/>At a glimpse of a pretty woman, my thoughts....  One dines and drinks a glass of wine, and feels strong and ready for anything.
<p/>I came home to Russia--had to see my wife, and, what's more, go to my country place; and there, you'd hardly believe it, in a fortnight I'd got into a dressing gown and given up dressing for dinner.
<p/>Needn't say I had no thoughts left for pretty women.
<p/>I became quite an old gentleman.
<p/>There was nothing left for me but to think of my eternal salvation.
<p/>I went off to Paris--I was as right as could be at once.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch felt exactly the difference that Pyotr Oblonsky described.
<p/>In Moscow he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) degenerated so much that if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had had to be there for long together, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might in good earnest have come to considering his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) salvation; in Petersburg he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) felt himself a man of the world again.
<p/>Between Princess Betsy Tverskaya and Stepan Arkadyevitch there had long existed rather curious relations.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch always flirted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) in jest, and used to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>), also in jest, the most unseemly things, knowing that nothing delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) so much.
<p/>The day after his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) conversation with Karenin, Stepan Arkadyevitch went to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>), and felt so youthful that in this jesting flirtation and nonsense he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) recklessly went so far that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did not know how to extricate himself, as unluckily he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was so far from being attracted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>) positively disagreeable.
<p/>What made it hard to change the conversation was the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was very attractive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tverskaya</b></font>).
<p/>So that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was considerably relieved at the arrival of Princess Myakaya, which cut short their  t√™te-√†-t√™te .
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, so you're here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and what news of your poor sister?
<p/>You needn't look at me like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) added.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ever since they've all turned against her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), all those who're a thousand times worse than she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), I've thought she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did a very fine thing.
<p/>I can't forgive Vronsky for not letting me know when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was in Petersburg.
<p/>I'd have gone to see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and gone about with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) everywhere.

 (<font color='red'><b>Myakaya</b></font>)</div><p/>Princess Myakaya interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) immediately, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) always did, and began talking herself.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) did better still in throwing up that crazy brother-in-law of yours.
<p/>You must excuse me.
<p/>Everybody used to say he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) was so clever, so very clever; I was the only one that said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) was a fool.
<p/>Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>)'s so thick with Lidia Ivanovna and Landau, they all say he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>)'s crazy, and I should prefer not to agree with everybody, but this time I can't help it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do please explain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch; <div class="bookquote">``what does it mean?

 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, so that's it, that's it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>said Princess Myakaya gleefully, <div class="bookquote">``they're going to ask Landau what he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>)'s to say.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Myakaya</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask Landau?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>)'s crazy too, but on him (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) your sister's fate depends.
<p/>See what comes of living in the provinces--you know nothing about anything.
<p/>Landau, do you see, was a  commis  in a shop in Paris, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) went to a doctor's; and in the doctor's waiting room he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) fell asleep, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) sleep he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) began giving advice to all the patients.
<p/>And wonderful advice it was!
<p/>Then the wife of Yury Meledinsky--you know, the invalid?--heard of this Landau, and had him (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) to see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) cured her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, though I can't say that I see he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) did him (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) much good, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>)'s just as feeble a creature as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) was, but they believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>), and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) along with them and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) to Russia.
<p/>Here there's been a general rush to him (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>)'s begun doctoring everyone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) cured Countess Bezzubova, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) took such a fancy to him (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) adopted him (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bartnyansky</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 21   After a capital dinner and a great deal of cognac drunk at Bartnyansky's, Stepan Arkadyevitch, only a little later than the appointed time, went in to Countess Lidia Ivanovna's.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who else is with the countess?--a Frenchman?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch asked the hall porter, as he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) glanced at the familiar overcoat of Alexey Alexandrovitch and a queer, rather artless-looking overcoat with clasps.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin and Count Bezzubov,''  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div>the porter answered severely.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Princess Myakaya guessed right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>thought Stepan Arkadyevitch, as he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) went upstairs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Curious!
<p/>It would be quite as well, though, to get on friendly terms with her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) has immense influence.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would say a word to Pomorsky, the thing would be a certainty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div><p/>It was still quite light out-of-doors, but in Countess Lidia Ivanovna's little drawing room the blinds were drawn and the lamps lighted.
<p/>At a round table under a lamp sat the countess and Alexey Alexandrovitch, talking softly.
<p/>A short, thinnish man, very pale and handsome, with feminine hips and knock-kneed legs, with fine brilliant eyes and long hair lying on the collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat, was standing at the end of the room gazing at the portraits on the wall.
<p/>After greeting the lady of the house and Alexey Alexandrovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch could not resist glancing once more at the unknown man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Landau!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the countess</b></font>)</div><p/>the countess addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) with a softness and caution that impressed Oblonsky.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) introduced them.
<p/>Landau looked round hurriedly, came up, and smiling, laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) moist, lifeless hand in Stepan Arkadyevitch's outstretched hand and immediately walked away and fell to gazing at the portraits again.
<p/>The countess and Alexey Alexandrovitch looked at each other significantly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad to see you, particularly today,''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div>said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, pointing Stepan Arkadyevitch to a seat beside Karenin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I introduced you to him (<font color='blue'><b>Karenin</b></font>) as Landau,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said in a soft voice, glancing at the Frenchman and again immediately after at Alexey Alexandrovitch, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) is really Count Bezzubov, as you're probably aware.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This separation is awful for her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)'s going to Paris.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) heard a voice yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div>said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, looking at Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, a voice!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div><p/>repeated Oblonsky, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) must be as circumspect as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) possibly could in this society, where something peculiar was going on, or was to go on, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had not the key.
<p/>A moment's silence followed, after which Countess Lidia Ivanovna, as though approaching the main topic of conversation, said with a fine smile to Oblonsky:  <div class="bookquote">``I've known you for a long while, and am very glad to make a closer acquaintance with you.
<p/>Les amis de nos amis sont nos amis.
<p/>But to be a true friend, one must enter into the spiritual state of one's friend, and I fear that you are not doing so in the case of Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/>You understand what I mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) fine pensive eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In part, countess, I understand the position of Alexey Alexandrovitch...''  (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div>said Oblonsky.
<p/>Having no clear idea what they were talking about, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) wanted to confine himself to generalities.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The change is not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) external position,''  (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div>Countess Lidia Ivanovna said sternly, following with eyes of love the figure of Alexey Alexandrovitch as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) got up and crossed over to Landau; <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) heart is changed, a new heart has been vouchsafed him (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>), and I fear you don't fully apprehend the change that has taken place in him (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The change that has taken place in him (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) cannot lessen his (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) love for his (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) neighbors; on the contrary, that change can only intensify love in his (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) heart.
<p/>But I am afraid you do not understand me.
<p/>Won't you have some tea?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) said, with her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) eyes indicating the footman, who was handing round tea on a tray.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do believe I might ask her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) to speak to both of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>thought Stepan Arkadyevitch.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, of course; but...''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>and Stepan Arkadyevitch paused in confusion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) understood at last that they were talking of religion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) will fall asleep immediately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch in a whisper full of meaning, going up to Lidia Ivanovna.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch looked round.
<p/>Landau was sitting at the window, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) elbow and the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) chair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) head drooping.
<p/>Noticing that all eyes were turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) head and smiled a smile of childlike artlessness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't take any notice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lidia Ivanovna/Lidia</b></font>)</div>said Lidia Ivanovna, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) lightly moved a chair up for Alexey Alexandrovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have observed...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was beginning, when a footman came into the room with a letter.
<p/>Lidia Ivanovna rapidly ran her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes over the note, and excusing herself, wrote an answer with extraordinary rapidity, handed it to the man, and came back to the table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have observed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``that Moscow people, especially the men, are more indifferent to religion than anyone.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But as far as I can make out, you are unfortunately one of the indifferent ones,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch, turning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) with a weary smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How anyone can be indifferent!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not so much indifferent on that subject as I am waiting in suspense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) most deprecating smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly think that the time for such questions has come yet for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch and Lidia Ivanovna looked at each other.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can never tell whether the time has come for us or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div>said Alexey Alexandrovitch severely.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We ought not to think whether we are ready or not ready.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you allow me to listen?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; I did not want to disturb you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lidia Ivanovna/Lidia</b></font>)</div>said Lidia Ivanovna, gazing tenderly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``sit here with us.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But a man may feel himself unworthy sometimes to rise to that height,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, conscious of hypocrisy in admitting this religious height, but at the same time unable to bring himself to acknowledge his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) free-thinking views before a person who, by a single word to Pomorsky, might procure him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the coveted appointment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is, you mean that sin keeps him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back?''

<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch and Lidia Ivanovna exchanged meaningful glances, and the reading began.
<p/>Chapter 22   Stepan Arkadyevitch felt completely nonplussed by the strange talk which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was hearing for the first time.
<p/>The complexity of Petersburg, as a rule, had a stimulating effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), rousing him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) Moscow stagnation.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) liked these complications, and understood them only in the circles he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) knew and was at home in.
<p/>In these unfamiliar surroundings he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was puzzled and disconcerted, and could not get his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) bearings.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) listened to Countess Lidia Ivanovna, aware of the beautiful, artless--or perhaps artful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not decide which--eyes of Landau fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>), Stepan Arkadyevitch began to be conscious of a peculiar heaviness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) head.
<p/>The most incongruous ideas were in confusion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marie Sanina is glad her (<font color='blue'><b>Sanina</b></font>) child's dead....  How good a smoke would be now!...
<p/>To be saved, one need only believe, and the monks don't know how the thing's to be done, but Countess Lidia Ivanovna does know....  And why is my head so heavy?
<p/>Is it the cognac, or all this being so queer?
<p/>Anyway, I fancy I've done nothing unsuitable so far.
<p/>But anyway, it won't do to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) now.
<p/>They say they make one say one's prayers.
<p/>I only hope they won't make me!
<p/>That'll be too imbecile.
<p/>And what stuff it is she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'s reading!
<p/>but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) has a good accent.
<p/>Landau--Bezzubov-- what's he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) Bezzubov for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>All at once Stepan Arkadyevitch became aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) lower jaw was uncontrollably forming a yawn.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) whiskers to cover the yawn, and shook himself together.
<p/>But soon after he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) became aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) was dropping asleep and on the very point of snoring.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) recovered himself at the very moment when the voice of Countess Lidia Ivanovna was saying <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>)'s asleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lidia Ivanovna/Lidia</b></font>)</div><p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch started with dismay, feeling guilty and caught.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) was reassured at once by seeing that the words <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>)'s asleep''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>referred not to him (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>), but to Landau.
<p/>The Frenchman was asleep as well as Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>But Stepan Arkadyevitch's being asleep would have offended them, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) thought -LRB-though even this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Landau</b></font>) thought, might not be so, as everything seemed so queer-RRB-, while Landau's being asleep delighted them extremely, especially Countess Lidia Ivanovna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mon ami,''   (<font color='red'><b>Lidia Ivanovna/Lidia</b></font>)</div>said Lidia Ivanovna, carefully holding the folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) silk gown so as not to rustle, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) excitement calling Karenin not Alexey Alexandrovitch, but  <div class="bookquote">``mon ami,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``donnez-lui la main.
<p/>Vous voyez?
<p/>Sh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alexey Alexandrovitch/Alexey/Karenin</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hissed at the footman as he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) came in again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The Frenchman</b></font>)</div><p/>The Frenchman was asleep, or pretending to be asleep, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) head on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) chair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) moist hand, as it lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) knee, made faint movements, as though trying to catch something.
<p/>Alexey Alexandrovitch got up, tried to move carefully, but stumbled against the table, went up and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) hand in the Frenchman's hand.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch got up too, and opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) eyes wide, trying to wake himself up if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) were asleep, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) looked first at one and then at the other.
<p/>It was all real.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) head was getting worse and worse.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Que la personne qui est arrivee la derniere, celle qui demande, qu'elle sorte!
<p/>Qu'elle sorte!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Frenchman</b></font>)</div><p/>articulated the Frenchman, without opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vous m`excuserez, mais vous voyez....  Revenez vers dix heures, encore mieux demain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Qu'elle sorte!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Frenchman</b></font>)</div><p/>repeated the Frenchman impatiently.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``C'est moi, n'est-ce pas?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>And receiving an answer in the affirmative, Stepan Arkadyevitch, forgetting the favor he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) had meant to ask of Lidia Ivanovna, and forgetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) sister's affairs, caring for nothing, but filled with the sole desire to get away as soon as possible, went out on tiptoe and ran out into the street as though from a plague-stricken house.
<p/>For a long while he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) chatted and joked with his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) cab-driver, trying to recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) spirits.
<p/>At the French theater where he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) arrived for the last act, and afterwards at the Tatar restaurant after his (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) champagne, Stepan Arkadyevitch felt a little refreshed in the atmosphere he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) was used to.
<p/>But still he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) felt quite unlike himself all that evening.
<p/>On getting home to Pyotr Oblonsky's, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) was staying, Stepan Arkadyevitch found a note from Betsy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) was very anxious to finish their interrupted conversation, and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) to come next day.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) had scarcely read this note, and frowned at its contents, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) heard below the ponderous tramp of the servants, carrying something heavy.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch went out to look.
<p/>It was the rejuvenated Pyotr Oblonsky.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) was so drunk that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) could not walk upstairs; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) told them to set him (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) legs when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) saw Stepan Arkadyevitch, and clinging to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>), walked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) room and there began telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) had spent the evening, and fell asleep doing so.
<p/>Stepan Arkadyevitch was in very low spirits, which happened rarely with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>), and for a long while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) could not go to sleep.
<p/>Everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) could recall to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) mind, everything was disgusting; but most disgusting of all, as if it were something shameful, was the memory of the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) had spent at Countess Lidia Ivanovna's.
<p/>Next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) received from Alexey Alexandrovitch a final answer, refusing to grant Anna's divorce, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) understood that this decision was based on what the Frenchman had said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) real or pretended trance.
<p/>Chapter 23   In order to carry through any undertaking in family life, there must necessarily be either complete division between the husband and wife, or loving agreement.
<p/>When the relations of a couple are vacillating and neither one thing nor the other, no sort of enterprise can be undertaken.
<p/>Many families remain for years in the same place, though both husband and wife are sick of it, simply because there is neither complete division nor agreement between them.
<p/>Both Vronsky and Anna felt life in Moscow insupportable in the heat and dust, when the spring sunshine was followed by the glare of summer, and all the trees in the boulevards had long since been in full leaf, and the leaves were covered with dust.
<p/>But they did not go back to Vozdvizhenskoe, as they had arranged to do long before; they went on staying in Moscow, though they both loathed it, because of late there had been no agreement between them.
<p/>The irritability that kept them apart had no external cause, and all efforts to come to an understanding intensified it, instead of removing it.
<p/>It was an inner irritation, grounded in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mind on the conviction that his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) love had grown less; in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), on regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had put himself for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sake in a difficult position, which she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), instead of lightening, made still more difficult.
<p/>Neither of them gave full utterance to their sense of grievance, but they considered each other in the wrong, and tried on every pretext to prove this to one another.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes the whole of him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), with all his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) habits, ideas, desires, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) spiritual and physical temperament, was one thing--love for women, and that love, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) felt, ought to be entirely concentrated on her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) alone.
<p/>That love was less; consequently, as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) reasoned, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) must have transferred part of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) love to other women or to another woman--and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was jealous.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was jealous not of any particular woman but of the decrease of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) love.
<p/>Not having got an object for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) jealousy, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was on the lookout for it.
<p/>At the slightest hint she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) transferred her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) jealousy from one object to another.
<p/>At one time she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was jealous of those low women with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) might so easily renew his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) old bachelor ties; then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was jealous of the society women he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) might meet; then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was jealous of the imaginary girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) might want to marry, for whose sake he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would break with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>And this last form of jealousy tortured her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) most of all, especially as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had unwarily told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), in a moment of frankness, that his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mother knew him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) so little that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had had the audacity to try and persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to marry the young Princess Sorokina.
<p/>And being jealous of him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), Anna was indignant against him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) and found grounds for indignation in everything.
<p/>For everything that was difficult in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) position she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) blamed him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
<p/>The agonizing condition of suspense she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had passed in Moscow, the tardiness and indecision of Alexey Alexandrovitch, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) solitude--she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) put it all down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would have seen all the bitterness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) position, and would have rescued her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) from it.
<p/>For her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) being in Moscow and not in the country, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was to blame too.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) could not live buried in the country as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would have liked to do.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) must have society, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had put her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in this awful position, the bitterness of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) would not see.
<p/>And again, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) fault that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was forever separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) son.
<p/>Even the rare moments of tenderness that came from time to time did not soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>); in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) tenderness now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw a shade of complacency, of self-confidence, which had not been of old, and which exasperated her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>It was dusk.
<p/>Anna was alone, and waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) to come back from a bachelor dinner.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) walked up and down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) study -LRB-the room where the noise from the street was least heard-RRB-, and thought over every detail of their yesterday's quarrel.
<p/>Going back from the well-remembered, offensive words of the quarrel to what had been the ground of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) arrived at last at its origin.
<p/>For a long while she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could hardly believe that their dissension had arisen from a conversation so inoffensive, of so little moment to either.
<p/>But so it actually had been.
<p/>It all arose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) laughing at the girls' high schools, declaring they were useless, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) defended them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had spoken slightingly of women's education in general, and had said that Hannah, Anna's English proteg√©e, had not the slightest need to know anything of physics.
<p/>This irritated Anna.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw in this a contemptuous reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) occupations.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bethought her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) of a phrase to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) back for the pain he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't expect you to understand me, my feelings, as anyone who loved me might, but simple delicacy I did expect,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had actually flushed with vexation, and had said something unpleasant.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not recall her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) answer, but at that point, with an unmistakable desire to wound her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had said:  <div class="bookquote">``I feel no interest in your infatuation over this girl, that's true, because I see it's unnatural.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The cruelty with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) shattered the world she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had built up for herself so laboriously to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to endure her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hard life, the injustice with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had accused her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) of affectation, of artificiality, aroused her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry that nothing but what's coarse and material is comprehensible and natural to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said and walked out of the room.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had come in to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) yesterday evening, they had not referred to the quarrel, but both felt that the quarrel had been smoothed over, but was not at an end.
<p/>Today he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had not been at home all day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt so lonely and wretched in being on bad terms with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wanted to forget it all, to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and be reconciled with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wanted to throw the blame on herself and to justify him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am myself to blame.
<p/>I'm irritable, I'm insanely jealous.
<p/>I will make it up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and we'll go away to the country; there I shall be more at peace.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unnatural!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) suddenly recalled the word that had stung her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) most of all, not so much the word itself as the intent to wound her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with which it was said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) meant; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) meant-- unnatural, not loving my own daughter, to love another person's child.
<p/>What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) know of love for children, of my love for Seryozha, whom I've sacrificed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)?
<p/>But that wish to wound me!
<p/>No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) loves another woman, it must be so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And perceiving that, while trying to regain her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) peace of mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had gone round the same circle that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been round so often before, and had come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) former state of exasperation, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was horrified at herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can it be impossible?
<p/>Can it be beyond me to control myself?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said to herself, and began again from the beginning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)'s truthful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>)'s honest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) loves me.
<p/>I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>), and in a few days the divorce will come.
<p/>What more do I want?
<p/>I want peace of mind and trust, and I will take the blame on myself.
<p/>Yes, now when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) comes in, I will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) I was wrong, though I was not wrong, and we will go away tomorrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And to escape thinking any more, and being overcome by irritability, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) rang, and ordered the boxes to be brought up for packing their things for the country.
<p/>At ten o'clock Vronsky came in.
<p/>Chapter 24   <div class="bookquote">``Well, was it nice?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) asked, coming out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) with a penitent and meek expression.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as usual,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) answered, seeing at a glance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) good moods.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was used by now to these transitions, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was particularly glad to see it today, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) was in a specially good humor himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do I see?

<p/>I'll be back directly, and we'll talk it over; I only want to change my coat.
<p/>Order some tea.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) room.
<p/>There was something mortifying in the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) had said <div class="bookquote">``Come, that's good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as one says to a child when it leaves off being naughty, and still more mortifying was the contrast between her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) penitent and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) self-confident tone; and for one instant she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) felt the lust of strife rising up in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) again, but making an effort she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) conquered it, and met Vronsky as good-humoredly as before.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) came in she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), partly repeating phrases she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had prepared beforehand, how she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had spent the day, and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) plans for going away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know it came to me almost like an inspiration,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why wait here for the divorce?
<p/>Won't it be just the same in the country?
<p/>I can't wait any longer!
<p/>I don't want to go on hoping, I don't want to hear anything about the divorce.
<p/>I have made up my mind it shall not have any more influence on my life.
<p/>Do you agree?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, glancing uneasily at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) excited face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you do?
<p/>Who was there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, after a pause.
<p/>Vronsky mentioned the names of the guests.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dinner was first rate, and the boat race, and it was all pleasant enough, but in Moscow they can never do anything without something ridicule .
<p/>A lady of a sort appeared on the scene, teacher of swimming to the Queen of Sweden, and gave us an exhibition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) skill.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What an absurd fancy!
<p/>Why, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) swim in some special way, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna, not answering.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was absolutely nothing in it.
<p/>That's just what I say, it was awfully stupid.
<p/>Well, then, when do you think of going?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head as though trying to drive away some unpleasant idea.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When?
<p/>Why, the sooner the better!
<p/>By tomorrow we shan't be ready.
<p/>The day after tomorrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes...oh, no, wait a minute!
<p/>The day after to-morrow's Sunday, I have to be at maman's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky, embarrassed, because as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) uttered his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mother's name he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) intent, suspicious eyes.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) embarrassment confirmed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) suspicion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) flushed hotly and drew away from him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
<p/>It was now not the Queen of Sweden's swimming-mistress who filled Anna's imagination, but the young Princess Sorokina.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sorokina</b></font>) was staying in a village near Moscow with Countess Vronskaya.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you go tomorrow?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, no!
<p/>The deeds and the money for the business I'm going there for I can't get by tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If so, we won't go at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not go later.
<p/>Monday or never!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vronsky, as though in amazement.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, there's no meaning in it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no meaning in it to you, because you care nothing for me.

<p/>Why, you said yesterday that I don't love my daughter, that I love this English girl, that it's unnatural.
<p/>I should like to know what life there is for me that could be natural!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For an instant she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a clear vision of what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was doing, and was horrified at how she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had fallen away from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) resolution.
<p/>But even though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew it was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own ruin, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not restrain herself, could not keep herself from proving to him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was wrong, could not give way to him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Vronsky, getting up from his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) chair; and stopping short, facing her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) said, speaking deliberately: <div class="bookquote">``What do you try my patience for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>looking as though he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) might have said much more, but was restraining himself.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cried, looking with terror at the undisguised hatred in his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) whole face, and especially in his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) cruel, menacing eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to say...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was beginning, but he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) checked himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But that I don't want; that's secondary.

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) turned towards the door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!

 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vronsky, with no change in the gloomy lines of his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) brows, though he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) by the hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it all about?

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, and hastily let go her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hates me, that's clear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thought, and in silence, without looking round, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) walked with faltering steps out of the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves another woman, that's even clearer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said to herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) went into her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want love, and there is none.
<p/>So, then, all is over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) repeated the words she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had said, <div class="bookquote">``and it must be ended.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asked herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sat down in a low chair before the looking glass.
<p/>Thoughts of where she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would go now, whether to the aunt who had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) up, to Dolly, or simply alone abroad, and of what he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)  was doing now alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) study; whether this was the final quarrel, or whether reconciliation were still possible; and of what all her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) old friends at Petersburg would say of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) now; and of how Alexey Alexandrovitch would look at it, and many other ideas of what would happen now after this rupture, came into her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head; but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did not give herself up to them with all her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) heart.
<p/>At the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) heart was some obscure idea that alone interested her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could not get clear sight of it.
<p/>Thinking once more of Alexey Alexandrovitch, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) recalled the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) illness after her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) confinement, and the feeling which never left her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at that time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't I die?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>and the words and the feeling of that time came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>And all at once she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) knew what was in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) soul.
<p/>Yes, it was that idea which alone solved all.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to die!...
<p/>And the shame and disgrace of Alexey Alexandrovitch and of Seryozha, and my awful shame, it will all be saved by death.
<p/>To die!
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) will feel remorse; will be sorry; will love me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) will suffer on my account.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With the trace of a smile of commiseration for herself she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sat down in the armchair, taking off and putting on the rings on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) left hand, vividly picturing from different sides his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) feelings after her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) death.
<p/>Approaching footsteps--his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) steps--distracted her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) attention.
<p/>As though absorbed in the arrangement of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rings, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did not even turn to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) by the hand, said softly:  <div class="bookquote">``Anna, we'll go the day after tomorrow, if you like.
<p/>I agree to everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not speak.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovitch</b></font>) urged.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, and at the same instant, unable to restrain herself any longer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) burst into sobs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cast me off!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) articulated between her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sobs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go away tomorrow...I'll do more.
<p/>What am I?
<p/>An immoral woman!
<p/>A stone round your neck.
<p/>I don't want to make you wretched, I don't want to!
<p/>I'll set you free.
<p/>You don't love me; you love someone else!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky besought her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be calm, and declared that there was no trace of foundation for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) jealousy; that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had never ceased, and never would cease, to love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) more than ever.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna, why distress yourself and me so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hands.
<p/>There was tenderness now in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) caught the sound of tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) voice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt them wet on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand.
<p/>And instantly Anna's despairing jealousy changed to a despairing passion of tenderness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) arms round him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and covered with kisses his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head, his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) neck, his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Chapter 25   Feeling that the reconciliation was complete, Anna set eagerly to work in the morning preparing for their departure.
<p/>Though it was not settled whether they should go on Monday or Tuesday, as they had each given way to the other, Anna packed busily, feeling absolutely indifferent whether they went a day earlier or later.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was standing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) room over an open box, taking things out of it, when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came in to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) earlier than usual, dressed to go out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going off at once to see maman; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) can send me the money by Yegorov.
<p/>And I shall be ready to go tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said.
<p/>Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was in such a good mood, the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) visit to his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mother's gave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a pang.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I shan't be ready by then myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said; and at once reflected, <div class="bookquote">``so then it was possible to arrange to do as I wished.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, do as you meant to do.
<p/>Go into the dining room, I'm coming directly.
<p/>It's only to turn out those things that aren't wanted,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, putting something more on the heap of frippery that lay in Annushka's arms.
<p/>Vronsky was eating his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) beefsteak when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came into the dining- room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't believe how distasteful these rooms have become to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, sitting down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) coffee.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing more awful than these  chambres garnies .

<p/>Vronsky's valet came in to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) to sign a receipt for a telegram from Petersburg.
<p/>There was nothing out of the way in Vronsky's getting a telegram, but he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) said, as though anxious to conceal something from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), that the receipt was in his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) study, and he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) turned hurriedly to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``By tomorrow, without fail, I will finish it all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From whom is the telegram?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you show it to me?

 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Vronsky called the valet back, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) to bring the telegram.

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>With trembling hands Anna took the telegram, and read what Vronsky had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) cup, with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) little finger held apart, and put it to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lips.
<p/>After drinking a few sips she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) expression, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) saw clearly that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was repelled by her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hand, and her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gesture, and the sound made by her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lips.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care in the least what your mother thinks, and what match she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wants to make for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, putting the cup down with a shaking hand.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not answer.
<p/>Looking intently at him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) face, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) recalled all the details of their reconciliation the previous day, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) passionate caresses.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, just such caresses he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has lavished, and will lavish, and longs to lavish on other women!''

(<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Must decide, and I have decided,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have gone away, but at that moment Yashvin walked into the room.
<p/>Anna greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) and remained.
<p/>Why, when there was a tempest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soul, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was standing at a turning point in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) life, which might have fearful consequences--why, at that minute, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had to keep up appearances before an outsider, who sooner or later must know it all--she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not know.
<p/>But at once quelling the storm within her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sat down and began talking to their guest.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how are you getting on?
<p/>Has your debt been paid you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked Yashvin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, pretty fair; I fancy I shan't get it all, but I shall get a good half.
<p/>And when are you off?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Yashvin/Prince Yashvin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Yashvin, looking at Vronsky, and unmistakably guessing at a quarrel.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The day after tomorrow, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>said Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been meaning to go so long, though.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But now it's quite decided,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, looking Vronsky straight in the face with a look which told him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) not to dream of the possibility of reconciliation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you feel sorry for that unlucky Pyevtsov?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went on, talking to Yashvin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've never asked myself the question, Anna Arkadyevna, whether I'm sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) or not.
<p/>You see, all my fortune's here'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) breast pocket--<div class="bookquote">``and just now I'm a wealthy man.
<p/>But today I'm going to the club, and I may come out a beggar.
<p/>You see, whoever sits down to play with me--he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) wants to leave me without a shirt to my back, and so do I him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>).
<p/>And so we fight it out, and that's the pleasure of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but suppose you were married,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, <div class="bookquote">``how would it be for your wife?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Yashvin laughed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's why I'm not married, and never mean to be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Helsingfors?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vronsky, entering into the conversation and glancing at Anna's smiling face.
<p/>Meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) eyes, Anna's face instantly took a coldly severe expression as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) were saying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>):  <div class="bookquote">``It's not forgotten.
<p/>It's all the same.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you really in love?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to Yashvin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh heavens!
<p/>ever so many times!
<p/>But you see, some men can play but only so that they can always lay down their cards when the hour of a  rendezvous  comes, while I can take up love, but only so as not to be late for my cards in the evening.
<p/>That's how I manage things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I didn't mean that, but the real thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would have said  Helsingfors , but would not repeat the word used by Vronsky.
<p/>Voytov, who was buying the horse, came in.
<p/>Anna got up and went out of the room.
<p/>Before leaving the house, Vronsky went into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would have pretended to be looking for something on the table, but ashamed of making a pretense, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked straight in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face with cold eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked in French.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To get the guarantee for Gambetta, I've sold him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, in a tone which said more clearly than words, <div class="bookquote">``I've no time for discussing things, and it would lead to nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not to blame in any way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) will punish herself,  tant pis pour elle. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was going he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said something, and his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) heart suddenly ached with pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, Anna?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) queried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I said nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) answered just as coldly and calmly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing, tant pis then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thought, feeling cold again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) turned and went out.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was going out he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) caught a glimpse in the looking glass of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face, white, with quivering lips.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) even wanted to stop and to say some comforting word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), but his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) legs carried him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) out of the room before he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could think what to say.
<p/>The whole of that day he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) spent away from home, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came in late in the evening the maid told him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) that Anna Arkadyevna had a headache and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) not to go in to her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 26   Never before had a day been passed in quarrel.
<p/>Today was the first time.
<p/>And this was not a quarrel.
<p/>It was the open acknowledgment of complete coldness.
<p/>Was it possible to glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had glanced when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came into the room for the guarantee?--to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>), see her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) heart was breaking with despair, and go out without a word with that face of callous composure?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was not merely cold to her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Arkadyevna</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) loved another woman--that was clear.
<p/>And remembering all the cruel words he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had said, Anna supplied, too, the words that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had unmistakably wished to say and could have said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) grew more and more exasperated.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't prevent you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might say.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can go where you like.
<p/>You were unwilling to be divorced from your husband, no doubt so that you might go back to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>Go back to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>If you want money, I'll give it to you.
<p/>How many roubles do you want?''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>All the most cruel words that a brutal man could say, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) imagination, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for them, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had actually said them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only yesterday swear he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved me, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), a truthful and sincere man?
<p/>Haven't I despaired for nothing many times already?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to herself afterwards.
<p/>All that day, except for the visit to Wilson's, which occupied two hours, Anna spent in doubts whether everything were over or whether there were still hope of reconciliation, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) should go away at once or see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) once more.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) the whole day, and in the evening, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own room, leaving a message for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head ached, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) comes in spite of what the maid says, it means that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) loves me still.
<p/>If not, it means that all is over, and then I will decide what I'm to do!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) heard the rumbling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) carriage stop at the entrance, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) ring, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) steps and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) conversation with the servant; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) believed what was told him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>), did not care to find out more, and went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) own room.
<p/>So then everything was over.
<p/>And death rose clearly and vividly before her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) mind as the sole means of bringing back love for her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) heart, of punishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) and of gaining the victory in that strife which the evil spirit in possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) heart was waging with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>).
<p/>Now nothing mattered: going or not going to Vozdvizhenskoe, getting or not getting a divorce from her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) husband--all that did not matter.
<p/>The one thing that mattered was punishing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) poured herself out her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) usual dose of opium, and thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had only to drink off the whole bottle to die, it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) so simple and easy, that she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) began musing with enjoyment on how he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would suffer, and repent and love her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) memory when it would be too late.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) lay in bed with open eyes, by the light of a single burned-down candle, gazing at the carved cornice of the ceiling and at the shadow of the screen that covered part of it, while she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) vividly pictured to herself how he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would feel when she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) would be no more, when she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) would be only a memory to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How could I say such cruel things to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would say.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How could I go out of the room without saying anything to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)?
<p/>But now she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) is no more.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) has gone away from us forever.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) is...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Suddenly the shadow of the screen wavered, pounced on the whole cornice, the whole ceiling; other shadows from the other side swooped to meet it, for an instant the shadows flitted back, but then with fresh swiftness they darted forward, wavered, commingled, and all was darkness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Death!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) thought.
<p/>And such horror came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) that for a long while she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) could not realize where she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was, and for a long while her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) trembling hands could not find the matches and light another candle, instead of the one that had burned down and gone out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, anything--only to live!
<p/>Why, I love him (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)!
<p/>Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) loves me!
<p/>This has been before and will pass,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) said, feeling that tears of joy at the return to life were trickling down her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) cheeks.
<p/>And to escape from her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) panic she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) went hurriedly to his (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was asleep there, and sleeping soundly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), and holding the light above his (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) gazed a long while at him (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>).
<p/>Now when he (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was asleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) so that at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) could not keep back tears of tenderness.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) knew that if he (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) waked up he (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) would look at her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) with cold eyes, convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was right, and that before telling him (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) love, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) would have to prove to him (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had been wrong in his (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) treatment of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>).
<p/>Without waking him (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) went back, and after a second dose of opium she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) fell towards morning into a heavy, incomplete sleep, during which she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) never quite lost consciousness.
<p/>In the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was waked by a horrible nightmare, which had recurred several times in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) dreams, even before her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) connection with Vronsky.
<p/>A little old man with unkempt beard was doing something bent down over some iron, muttering meaningless French words, and she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) always did in this nightmare -LRB-it was what made the horror of it-RRB-, felt that this peasant was taking no notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), but was doing something horrible with the iron-- over her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>).
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) waked up in a cold sweat.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) got up, the previous day came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) as though veiled in mist.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a quarrel.
<p/>Just what has happened several times.
<p/>I said I had a headache, and he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) did not come in to see me.
<p/>Tomorrow we're going away; I must see him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) and get ready for the journey,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) said to herself.
<p/>And learning that he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) study, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) went down to him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>).
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) passed through the drawing room she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) heard a carriage stop at the entrance, and looking out of the window she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) saw the carriage, from which a young girl in a lilac hat was leaning out giving some direction to the footman ringing the bell.
<p/>After a parley in the hall, someone came upstairs, and Vronsky's steps could be heard passing the drawing room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) went rapidly downstairs.
<p/>Anna went again to the window.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) come out onto the steps without his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) hat and go up to the carriage.
<p/>The young girl in the lilac hat handed him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) a parcel.
<p/>Vronsky, smiling, said something to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>The carriage drove away, he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) ran rapidly upstairs again.
<p/>The mists that had shrouded everything in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) soul parted suddenly.
<p/>The feelings of yesterday pierced the sick heart with a fresh pang.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not understand now how she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could have lowered herself by spending a whole day with him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) house.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went into his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) room to announce her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) determination.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was Madame Sorokina and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) daughter.
<p/>They came and brought me the money and the deeds from maman.
<p/>I couldn't get them yesterday.
<p/>How is your head, better?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) said quietly, not wishing to see and to understand the gloomy and solemn expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked silently, intently at him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>), standing in the middle of the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), frowned for a moment, and went on reading a letter.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turned, and went deliberately out of the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) still might have turned her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had reached the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) was still silent, and the only sound audible was the rustling of the note paper as he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) turned it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, by the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) said at the very moment she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was in the doorway, <div class="bookquote">``we're going tomorrow for certain, aren't we?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You, but not I,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, turning round to him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You...you will be sorry for this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, and went out.
<p/>Frightened by the desperate expression with which these words were uttered, he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) jumped up and would have run after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), but on second thoughts he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) sat down and scowled, setting his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) teeth.
<p/>This vulgar--as he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) thought it--threat of something vague exasperated him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've tried everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``the only thing left is not to pay attention,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) began to get ready to drive into town, and again to his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) mother's to get her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) signature to the deeds.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heard the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) steps about the study and the dining room.
<p/>At the drawing room he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) stood still.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) did not turn in to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) merely gave an order that the horse should be given to Voytov if he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) came while he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) was away.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heard the carriage brought round, the door opened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) came out again.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) went back into the porch again, and someone was running upstairs.
<p/>It was the valet running up for his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) gloves that had been forgotten.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went to the window and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) take the gloves without looking, and touching the coachman on the back he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) said something to him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>).
<p/>Then without looking up at the window he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) settled himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) usual attitude in the carriage, with his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) legs crossed, and drawing on his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) gloves he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) vanished round the corner.
<p/>Chapter 27   <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) has gone!
<p/>It is over!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna said to herself, standing at the window; and in answer to this statement the impression of the darkness when the candle had flickered out, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fearful dream mingling into one, filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart with cold terror.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, that cannot be!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cried, and crossing the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) rang the bell.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was so afraid now of being alone, that without waiting for the servant to come in, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Inquire where the count has gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.
<p/>The servant answered that the count had gone to the stable.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good.

<p/>For God's sake come!
<p/>I'm afraid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sealed it up and gave it to the servant.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was afraid of being left alone now; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) followed the servant out of the room, and went to the nursery.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, this isn't it, this isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)!

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) first thought when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) chubby, rosy little girl with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) black, curly hair instead of Seryozha, whom in the tangle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ideas she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had expected to see in the nursery.
<p/>The little girl sitting at the table was obstinately and violently battering on it with a cork, and staring aimlessly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mother with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pitch-black eyes.
<p/>Answering the English nurse that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was quite well, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was going to the country tomorrow, Anna sat down by the little girl and began spinning the cork to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>But the child's loud, ringing laugh, and the motion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyebrows, recalled Vronsky so vividly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) got up hurriedly, restraining her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sobs, and went away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can it be all over?
<p/>No, it cannot be!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) will come back.
<p/>But how can he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) explain that smile, that excitement after he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)?
<p/>But even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) doesn't explain, I will believe.
<p/>If I don't believe, there's only one thing left for me, and I can't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) watch.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mustn't see me with tear-stained eyes.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked herself.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not remember.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my hair has been done, but when I did it I can't in the least remember.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) certainly had, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not think when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had done it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought, looking in the looking glass at the swollen face with strangely glittering eyes, that looked in a scared way at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's I!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) suddenly understood, and looking round, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) seemed all at once to feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) kisses on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and twitched her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) shoulders, shuddering.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lips and kissed it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?
<p/>Why, I'm going out of my mind!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bedroom, where Annushka was tidying the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Annushka,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, coming to a standstill before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stared at the maid, not knowing what to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You meant to go and see Darya Alexandrovna,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) understood.

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took out her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) watch and looked at it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) go away, leaving me in such a state?
<p/>How can he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) live, without making it up with me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went to the window and began looking into the street.
<p/>Judging by the time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) might be back now.
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) calculations might be wrong, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) began once more to recall when he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had started and to count the minutes.
<p/>At the moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had moved away to the big clock to compare it with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) watch, someone drove up.
<p/>Glancing out of the window, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) carriage.
<p/>But no one came upstairs, and voices could be heard below.
<p/>It was the messenger who had come back in the carriage.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We didn't catch the count.
<p/>The count had driven off on the lower city road.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say?

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said to the rosy, good-humored Mihail, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) handed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) note.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) has never received it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go with this note to Countess Vronskaya's place, you know?
<p/>and bring an answer back immediately,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) said to the messenger.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I, what am I going to do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'm going to Dolly's, that's true or else I shall go out of my mind.
<p/>Yes, and I can telegraph, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) wrote a telegram.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I absolutely must talk to you; come at once.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>After sending off the telegram, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) went to dress.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was dressed and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) hat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) glanced again into the eyes of the plump, comfortable-looking Annushka.
<p/>There was unmistakable sympathy in those good-natured little gray eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Annushka, dear, what am I to do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>said Anna, sobbing and sinking helplessly into a chair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why fret yourself so, Anna Arkadyevna?
<p/>Why, there's nothing out of the way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'm going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, rousing herself and getting up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if there's a telegram while I'm away, send it on to Darya Alexandrovna's...but no, I shall be back myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I mustn't think, I must do something, drive somewhere, and most of all, get out of this house,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, feeling with terror the strange turmoil going on in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own heart, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) made haste to go out and get into the carriage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Pyotr before getting onto the box.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To Znamenka, the Oblonskys'.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 28   It was bright and sunny.
<p/>A fine rain had been falling all the morning, and now it had not long cleared up.
<p/>The iron roofs, the flags of the roads, the flints of the pavements, the wheels and leather, the brass and the tinplate of the carriages--all glistened brightly in the May sunshine.
<p/>It was three o'clock, and the very liveliest time in the streets.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) sat in a corner of the comfortable carriage, that hardly swayed on its supple springs, while the grays trotted swiftly, in the midst of the unceasing rattle of wheels and the changing impressions in the pure air, Anna ran over the events of the last days, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) position quite differently from how it had seemed at home.
<p/>Now the thought of death seemed no longer so terrible and so clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and death itself no longer seemed so inevitable.
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) blamed herself for the humiliation to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had lowered herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) to forgive me.

<p/>Can't I live without him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And leaving unanswered the question how she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was going to live without him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fell to reading the signs on the shops.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Office and warehouse.
<p/>Dental surgeon.
<p/>Yes, I'll tell Dolly all about it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) doesn't like Vronsky.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) loves me, and I'll follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) advice.
<p/>I won't give in to him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>); I won't let him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) train me as he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) pleases.

<p/>Ah, the springs at Mitishtchen, and the pancakes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) remembered how, long, long ago, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was a girl of seventeen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) aunt to Troitsa.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Riding, too.
<p/>Was that really me, with red hands?

<p/>How conceited and self-satisfied he (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) will be when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) gets my note!
<p/>But I will show him (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)....  How horrid that paint smells!

<p/>It was Annushka's husband.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our parasites'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) remembered how Vronsky had said that.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our?
<p/>Why our?
<p/>What's so awful is that one can't tear up the past by its roots.
<p/>One can't tear it out, but one can hide one's memory of it.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) past with Alexey Alexandrovitch, of how she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had blotted the memory of it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) life.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly will think I'm leaving my second husband, and so I certainly must be in the wrong.

<p/>No; and besides, Dolly wouldn't understand.

<p/>It would only be interesting to see Kitty, to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) how I despise everyone and everything, how nothing matters to me now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly came in with the letter.
<p/>Anna read it and handed it back in silence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and it doesn't interest me in the least.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, why so?
<p/>On the contrary, I have hopes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, looking inquisitively at Anna.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When are you going away?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) asked.
<p/>Anna, half-closing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes, looked straight before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and did not answer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why does Kitty shrink from me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, looking at the door and flushing red.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what nonsense!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)'s nursing, and things aren't going right with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), and I've been advising her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)....  She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)'s delighted.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)'ll be here in a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly awkwardly, not clever at lying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, here she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Hearing that Anna had called, Kitty had wanted not to appear, but Dolly persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/>Rallying her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) forces, Kitty went in, walked up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), blushing, and shook hands.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said with a trembling voice.
<p/>Kitty had been thrown into confusion by the inward conflict between her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) antagonism to this bad woman and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) desire to be nice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>But as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) saw Anna's lovely and attractive face, all feeling of antagonism disappeared.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not have been surprised if you had not cared to meet me.
<p/>I'm used to everything.
<p/>You have been ill?
<p/>Yes, you are changed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.
<p/>Kitty felt that Anna was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with hostile eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ascribed this hostility to the awkward position in which Anna, who had once patronized her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), must feel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) now, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>They talked of Kitty's illness, of the baby, of Stiva, but it was obvious that nothing interested Anna.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came to say good-bye to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, getting up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, when are you going?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>But again not answering, Anna turned to Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am very glad to have seen you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard so much of you from everyone, even from your husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So good-bye, Dolly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>And kissing Dolly and shaking hands with Kitty, Anna went out hurriedly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)'s just the same and just as charming!

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 29   Anna got into the carriage again in an even worse frame of mind than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) set out from home.
<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) previous tortures was added now that sense of mortification and of being an outcast which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had felt so distinctly on meeting Kitty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where to?
<p/>Home?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Pyotr.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, home,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, not even thinking now where she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was going.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How they looked at me as something dreadful, incomprehensible, and curious!
<p/>What can he (<font color='blue'><b>outcast</b></font>) be telling the other with such warmth?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) thought, staring at two men who walked by.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can one ever tell anyone what one is feeling?
<p/>I meant to tell Dolly, and it's a good thing I didn't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
<p/>How pleased she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) would have been at my misery!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) would have concealed it, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) chief feeling would have been delight at my being punished for the happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) envied me for.
<p/>Kitty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) would have been even more pleased.
<p/>How I can see through her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)!

<p/>If I were an immoral woman I could have made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband fall in love with me ...if I'd cared to.
<p/>And, indeed, I did care to.
<p/>There's someone who's pleased with himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw a fat, rubicund gentleman coming towards her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knew me.
<p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knows me as well as anyone in the world knows me.
<p/>I don't know myself.
<p/>I know my appetites, as the French say.
<p/>They want that dirty ice cream, that they do know for certain,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought, looking at two boys stopping an ice cream seller, who took a barrel off his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head and began wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) perspiring face with a towel.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We all want what is sweet and nice.

<p/>And we all hate each other.

<p/>Yes, that's the truth.
<p/>`Tiutkin, coiffeur.'
<p/>Je me fais coiffer par Tiutkin....

<p/>But the same instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had no one now to tell anything amusing to.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And there's nothing amusing, nothing mirthful, really.

<p/>Why these churches and this singing and this humbug?
<p/>Simply to conceal that we all hate each other like these cab drivers who are abusing each other so angrily.
<p/>Yashvin says, `He (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) wants to strip me of my shirt, and I him (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>).'
<p/>Yes, that's the truth!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) was plunged in these thoughts, which so engrossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) left off thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) own position, when the carriage drew up at the steps of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) house.
<p/>It was only when she (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) saw the porter running out to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) remembered she (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) had sent the note and the telegram.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there an answer?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) inquired.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll see this minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div>answered the porter, and glancing into his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) room, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) took out and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) the thin square envelope of a telegram.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't come before ten o'clock.--Vronsky,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) read.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And hasn't the messenger come back?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div>answered the porter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, since it's so, I know what I must do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) said, and feeling a vague fury and craving for revenge rising up within her (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) ran upstairs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go to him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) myself.
<p/>Before going away forever, I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) all.
<p/>Never have I hated anyone as I hate that man!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) thought.
<p/>Seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat on the rack, she (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) shuddered with aversion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) did not consider that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) telegram was an answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) telegram and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not yet received her (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) note.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yashvin</b></font>) pictured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to herself as talking calmly to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother and Princess Sorokina and rejoicing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sorokina</b></font>) sufferings.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I must go quickly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sorokina</b></font>) said, not knowing yet where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sorokina</b></font>) was going.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sorokina</b></font>) longed to get away as quickly as possible from the feelings she (<font color='blue'><b>Sorokina</b></font>) had gone through in that awful house.
<p/>The servants, the walls, the things in that house--all aroused repulsion and hatred in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sorokina</b></font>) and lay like a weight upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sorokina</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I must go to the railway station, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s not there, then go there and catch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna looked at the railway timetable in the newspapers.
<p/>An evening train went at two minutes past eight.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shall be in time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) gave orders for the other horses to be put in the carriage, and packed in a traveling-bag the things needed for a few days.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would never come back here again.
<p/>Among the plans that came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) vaguely determined that after what would happen at the station or at the countess's house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would go as far as the first town on the Nizhni road and stop there.
<p/>Dinner was on the table; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went up, but the smell of the bread and cheese was enough to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) feel that all food was disgusting.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ordered the carriage and went out.
<p/>The house threw a shadow now right across the street, but it was a bright evening and still warm in the sunshine.
<p/>Annushka, who came down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) things, and Pyotr, who put the things in the carriage, and the coachman, evidently out of humor, were all hateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and irritated her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) by their words and actions.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want you, Pyotr.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how about the ticket?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as you like, it doesn't matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said crossly.
<p/>Pyotr jumped on the box, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) arms akimbo, told the coachman to drive to the booking-office.
<p/>Chapter 30   <div class="bookquote">``Here it is again!
<p/>Again I understand it all!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna said to herself, as soon as the carriage had started and swaying lightly, rumbled over the tiny cobbles of the paved road, and again one impression followed rapidly upon another.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; what was the last thing I thought of so clearly?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tried to recall it.  ''
<p/>`Tiutkin, coiffeur?'
<p/>--no, not that.
<p/>Yes, of what Yashvin says, the struggle for existence and hatred is the one thing that holds men together.
<p/>No, it's a useless journey you're making,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, mentally addressing a party in a coach and four, evidently going for an excursion into the country.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the dog you're taking with you will be no help to you.
<p/>You can't get away from yourselves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes in the direction Pyotr had turned to look, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw a factory hand almost dead drunk, with hanging head, being led away by a policeman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>)'s found a quicker way,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Count Vronsky and I did not find that happiness either, though we expected so much from it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>And now for the first time Anna turned that glaring light in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was seeing everything on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) relations with him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>), which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had hitherto avoided thinking about.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was it he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) sought in me?
<p/>Not love so much as the satisfaction of vanity.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) words, the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) face, that recalled an abject setter-dog, in the early days of their connection.
<p/>And everything now confirmed this.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there was the triumph of success in him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>).
<p/>Of course there was love too, but the chief element was the pride of success.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) boasted of me.
<p/>Now that's over.
<p/>There's nothing to be proud of.
<p/>Not to be proud of, but to be ashamed of.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) has taken from me all he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) could, and now I am no use to him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) is weary of me and is trying not to be dishonorable in his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) behavior to me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) let that out yesterday--he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) wants divorce and marriage so as to burn his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) ships.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) loves me, but how?
<p/>The zest is gone, as the English say.
<p/>That fellow wants everyone to admire him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) and is very much pleased with himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) thought, looking at a red-faced clerk, riding on a riding school horse.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there's not the same flavor about me for him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) now.
<p/>If I go away from him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>), at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) will be glad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This was not mere supposition, she (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) saw it distinctly in the piercing light, which revealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) now the meaning of life and human relations.

<p/>We walked to meet each other up to the time of our love, and then we have been irresistibly drifting in different directions.
<p/>And there's no altering that.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) tells me I'm insanely jealous, and I have told myself that I am insanely jealous; but it's not true.
<p/>I'm not jealous, but I'm unsatisfied.
<p/>But...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lips, and shifted her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) place in the carriage in the excitement, aroused by the thought that suddenly struck her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I could be anything but a mistress, passionately caring for nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) caresses; but I can't and I don't care to be anything else.

<p/>Don't I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) wouldn't deceive me, that he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) has no schemes about Princess Sorokina, that he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)'s not in love with Kitty, that he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) won't desert me!
<p/>I know all that, but it makes it no better for me.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) answered now without the slightest hesitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought, too, that I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>), and used to be touched by my own tenderness.
<p/>But I have lived without him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>), I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) up for another love, and did not regret the exchange till that love was satisfied.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And with loathing she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought of what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meant by that love.
<p/>And the clearness with which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw life now, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own and all men's, was a pleasure to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's so with me and Pyotr, and the coachman, Fyodor, and that merchant, and all the people living along the Volga, where those placards invite one to go, and everywhere and always,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had driven under the low-pitched roof of the Nizhigorod station, and the porters ran to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A ticket to Obiralovka?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oblonsky/Pyotr/Pyotr Oblonsky</b></font>)</div><p/>said Pyotr.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had utterly forgotten where and why she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was going, and only by a great effort she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) understood the question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, handing him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) purse, and taking a little red bag in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got out of the carriage.
<p/>Making her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way through the crowd to the first-class waiting-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gradually recollected all the details of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) position, and the plans between which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was hesitating.
<p/>And again at the old sore places, hope and then despair poisoned the wounds of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tortured, fearfully throbbing heart.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat on the star-shaped sofa waiting for the train, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gazed with aversion at the people coming and going -LRB-they were all hateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)-RRB-, and thought how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would arrive at the station, would write him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a note, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would write to him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and how he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was at this moment complaining to his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother of his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) position, not understanding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sufferings, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would go into the room, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would say to him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought that life might still be happy, and how miserably she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loved and hated him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and how fearfully her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart was beating.
<p/>Chapter 31   A bell rang, some young men, ugly and impudent, and at the same time careful of the impression they were making, hurried by.
<p/>Pyotr, too, crossed the room in his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) livery and top-boots, with his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dull, animal face, and came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to the train.
<p/>Some noisy men were quiet as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) passed them on the platform, and one whispered something about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to another-- something vile, no doubt.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stepped up on the high step, and sat down in a carriage by herself on a dirty seat that had been white.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bag lay beside her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), shaken up and down by the springiness of the seat.
<p/>With a foolish smile Pyotr raised his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hat, with its colored band, at the window, in token of farewell; an impudent conductor slammed the door and the latch.
<p/>A grotesque-looking lady wearing a bustle -LRB-Anna mentally undressed the woman, and was appalled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hideousness-RRB-, and a little girl laughing affectedly ran down the platform.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Katerina Andreevna, she (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>)'s got them all,  ma tante! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>cried the girl.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Even the child's hideous and affected,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>thought Anna.
<p/>To avoid seeing anyone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) got up quickly and seated herself at the opposite window of the empty carriage.
<p/>A misshapen-looking peasant covered with dirt, in a cap from which his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) tangled hair stuck out all round, passed by that window, stooping down to the carriage wheels.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's something familiar about that hideous peasant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>thought Anna.
<p/>And remembering her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dream, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) moved away to the opposite door, shaking with terror.
<p/>The conductor opened the door and let in a man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you wish to get out?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna made no answer.
<p/>The conductor and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) two fellow-passengers did not notice under her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) veil her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) panic-stricken face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) corner and sat down.
<p/>The couple seated themselves on the opposite side, and intently but surreptitiously scrutinized her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) clothes.
<p/>Both husband and wife seemed repulsive to Anna.
<p/>The husband asked, would she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) allow him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to smoke, obviously not with a view to smoking but to getting into conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
<p/>Receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) assent, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife in French something about caring less to smoke than to talk.
<p/>They made inane and affected remarks to one another, entirely for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) benefit.
<p/>Anna saw clearly that they were sick of each other, and hated each other.
<p/>And no one could have helped hating such miserable monstrosities.
<p/>A second bell sounded, and was followed by moving of luggage, noise, shouting and laughter.
<p/>It was so clear to Anna that there was nothing for anyone to be glad of, that this laughter irritated her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) agonizingly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would have liked to stop up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ears not to hear it.
<p/>At last the third bell rang, there was a whistle and a hiss of steam, and a clank of chains, and the man in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) carriage crossed himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be interesting to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what meaning he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attaches to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>thought Anna, looking angrily at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked past the lady out of the window at the people who seemed whirling by as they ran beside the train or stood on the platform.
<p/>The train, jerking at regular intervals at the junctions of the rails, rolled by the platform, past a stone wall, a signal-box, past other trains; the wheels, moving more smoothly and evenly, resounded with a slight clang on the rails.
<p/>The window was lighted up by the bright evening sun, and a slight breeze fluttered the curtain.
<p/>Anna forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fellow passengers, and to the light swaying of the train she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fell to thinking again, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) breathed the fresh air.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, what did I stop at?
<p/>That I couldn't conceive a position in which life would not be a misery, that we are all created to be miserable, and that we all know it, and all invent means of deceiving each other.
<p/>And when one sees the truth, what is one to do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what reason is given man for, to escape from what worries him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady in French, lisping affectedly, and obviously pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) phrase.
<p/>The words seemed an answer to Anna's thoughts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To escape from what worries him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div>repeated Anna.
<p/>And glancing at the red-cheeked husband and the thin wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw that the sickly wife considered herself misunderstood, and the husband deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in that idea of herself.
<p/>Anna seemed to see all their history and all the crannies of their souls, as it were turning a light upon them.
<p/>But there was nothing interesting in them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'm very much worried, and that's what reason was given me for, to escape; so then one must escape: why not put out the light when there's nothing more to look at, when it's sickening to look at it all?
<p/>But how?
<p/>Why did the conductor run along the footboard, why are they shrieking, those young men in that train?
<p/>why are they talking, why are they laughing?
<p/>It's all falsehood, all lying, all humbug, all cruelty!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Anna Arkadyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>When the train came into the station, Anna got out into the crowd of passengers, and moving apart from them as if they were lepers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stood on the platform, trying to think what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had come here for, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) meant to do.
<p/>Everything that had seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) possible before was now so difficult to consider, especially in this noisy crowd of hideous people who would not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) alone.
<p/>One moment porters ran up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) proffering their services, then young men, clacking their heels on the planks of the platform and talking loudly, stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>); people meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dodged past on the wrong side.
<p/>Remembering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had meant to go on further if there were no answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stopped a porter and asked if her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) coachman were not here with a note from Count Vronsky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Count Vronsky?
<p/>They sent up here from the Vronskys just this minute, to meet Princess Sorokina and her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) daughter.
<p/>And what is the coachman like?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was talking to the porter, the coachman Mihail, red and cheerful in his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) smart blue coat and chain, evidently proud of having so successfully performed his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) commission, came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) a letter.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) broke it open, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) heart ached before she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had read it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry your note did not reach me.
<p/>I will be home at ten,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div>Vronsky had written carelessly...  <div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's what I expected!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) said to herself with an evil smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, you can go home then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) said softly, addressing Mihail.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) spoke softly because the rapidity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) heart's beating hindered her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) breathing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I won't let you make me miserable,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) thought menacingly, addressing not him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), not herself, but the power that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) suffer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) walked along the platform.
<p/>Two maidservants walking along the platform turned their heads, staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) and making some remarks about her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) dress.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Real,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>they said of the lace she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was wearing.
<p/>The young men would not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) in peace.
<p/>Again they passed by, peering into her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) face, and with a laugh shouting something in an unnatural voice.
<p/>The station-master coming up asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was going by train.
<p/>A boy selling kvas never took his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes off her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My God!
<p/>where am I to go?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) thought, going farther and farther along the platform.
<p/>At the end she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) stopped.
<p/>Some ladies and children, who had come to meet a gentleman in spectacles, paused in their loud laughter and talking, and stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) reached them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) pace and walked away from them to the edge of the platform.
<p/>A luggage train was coming in.
<p/>The platform began to sway, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was in the train again.
<p/>And all at once she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) thought of the man crushed by the train the day she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had first met Vronsky, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had to do.
<p/>With a rapid, light step she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) went down the steps that led from the tank to the rails and stopped quite near the approaching train.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) looked at the lower part of the carriages, at the screws and chains and the tall cast-iron wheel of the first carriage slowly moving up, and trying to measure the middle between the front and back wheels, and the very minute when that middle point would be opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) said to herself, looking into the shadow of the carriage, at the sand and coal dust which covered the sleepers-- <div class="bookquote">``there, in the very middle, and I will punish him (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) and escape from everyone and from myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the sleepers</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) tried to fling herself below the wheels of the first carriage as it reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>); but the red bag which she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) tried to drop out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hand delayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was too late; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) missed the moment.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had to wait for the next carriage.
<p/>A feeling such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had known when about to take the first plunge in bathing came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) crossed herself.
<p/>That familiar gesture brought back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) soul a whole series of girlish and childish memories, and suddenly the darkness that had covered everything for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was torn apart, and life rose up before her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) for an instant with all its bright past joys.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) did not take her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) eyes from the wheels of the second carriage.
<p/>And exactly at the moment when the space between the wheels came opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) dropped the red bag, and drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) head back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) shoulders, fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) hands under the carriage, and lightly, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) would rise again at once, dropped on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) knees.
<p/>And at the same instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was terror-stricken at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was doing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where am I?
<p/>What am I doing?
<p/>What for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) tried to get up, to drop backwards; but something huge and merciless struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) on the head and rolled her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) back.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, forgive me all!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) said, feeling it impossible to struggle.
<p/>A peasant muttering something was working at the iron above her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>).
<p/>And the light by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had read the book filled with troubles, falsehoods, sorrow, and evil, flared up more brightly than ever before, lighted up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) all that had been in darkness, flickered, began to grow dim, and was quenched forever.
<p/>PART 8     Chapter 1   Almost two months had passed.
<p/>The hot summer was half over, but Sergey Ivanovitch was only just preparing to leave Moscow.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch's life had not been uneventful during this time.
<p/>A year ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) book, the fruit of six years' labor, <div class="bookquote">``Sketch of a Survey of the Principles and Forms of Government in Europe and Russia.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Several sections of this book and its introduction had appeared in periodical publications, and other parts had been read by Sergey Ivanovitch to persons of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) circle, so that the leading ideas of the work could not be completely novel to the public.
<p/>But still Sergey Ivanovitch had expected that on its appearance his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) book would be sure to make a serious impression on society, and if it did not cause a revolution in social science it would, at any rate, make a great stir in the scientific world.
<p/>After the most conscientious revision the book had last year been published, and had been distributed among the booksellers.
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) asked no one about it, reluctantly and with feigned indifference answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) friends' inquiries as to how the book was going, and did not even inquire of the booksellers how the book was selling, Sergey Ivanovitch was all on the alert, with strained attention, watching for the first impression his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) book would make in the world and in literature.
<p/>But a week passed, a second, a third, and in society no impression whatever could be detected.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) friends who were specialists and savants, occasionally--unmistakably from politeness--alluded to it.
<p/>The rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) acquaintances, not interested in a book on a learned subject, did not talk of it at all.
<p/>And society generally--just now especially absorbed in other things--was absolutely indifferent.
<p/>In the press, too, for a whole month there was not a word about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) book.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch had calculated to a nicety the time necessary for writing a review, but a month passed, and a second, and still there was silence.
<p/>Only in the  Northern Beetle , in a comic article on the singer Drabanti, who had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) voice, there was a contemptuous allusion to Koznishev's book, suggesting that the book had been long ago seen through by everyone, and was a subject of general ridicule.
<p/>At last in the third month a critical article appeared in a serious review.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch knew the author of the article.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) once at Golubtsov's.
<p/>The author of the article was a young man, an invalid, very bold as a writer, but extremely deficient in breeding and shy in personal relations.
<p/>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) absolute contempt for the author, it was with complete respect that Sergey Ivanovitch set about reading the article.
<p/>The article was awful.
<p/>The critic had undoubtedly put an interpretation upon the book which could not possibly be put on it.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had selected quotations so adroitly that for people who had not read the book -LRB-and obviously scarcely anyone had read it-RRB- it seemed absolutely clear that the whole book was nothing but a medley of high-flown phrases, not even--as suggested by marks of interrogation--used appropriately, and that the author of the book was a person absolutely without knowledge of the subject.
<p/>And all this was so wittily done that Sergey Ivanovitch would not have disowned such wit himself.
<p/>But that was just what was so awful.
<p/>In spite of the scrupulous conscientiousness with which Sergey Ivanovitch verified the correctness of the critic's arguments, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) did not for a minute stop to ponder over the faults and mistakes which were ridiculed; but unconsciously he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) began immediately trying to recall every detail of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) meeting and conversation with the author of the article.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't I offend him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) in some way?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>Sergey Ivanovitch wondered.
<p/>And remembering that when they met he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had corrected the young man about something he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had said that betrayed ignorance, Sergey Ivanovitch found the clue to explain the article.
<p/>This article was followed by a deadly silence about the book both in the press and in conversation, and Sergey Ivanovitch saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) six years' task, toiled at with such love and labor, had gone, leaving no trace.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch's position was still more difficult from the fact that, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) book, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had had no more literary work to do, such as had hitherto occupied the greater part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) time.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch was clever, cultivated, healthy, and energetic, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) did not know what use to make of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) energy.
<p/>Conversations in drawing rooms, in meetings, assemblies, and committees--everywhere where talk was possible--took up part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) time.
<p/>But being used for years to town life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) did not waste all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) energies in talk, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) less experienced younger brother did, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was in Moscow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had a great deal of leisure and intellectual energy still to dispose of.
<p/>Fortunately for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), at this period so difficult for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) from the failure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) book, the various public questions of the dissenting sects, of the American alliance, of the Samara famine, of exhibitions, and of spiritualism, were definitely replaced in public interest by the Slavonic question, which had hitherto rather languidly interested society, and Sergey Ivanovitch, who had been one of the first to raise this subject, threw himself into it heart and soul.
<p/>In the circle to which Sergey Ivanovitch belonged, nothing was talked of or written about just now but the Servian War.
<p/>Everything that the idle crowd usually does to kill time was done now for the benefit of the Slavonic States.
<p/>Balls, concerts, dinners, matchboxes, ladies' dresses, beer, restaurants-- everything testified to sympathy with the Slavonic peoples.
<p/>From much of what was spoken and written on the subject, Sergey Ivanovitch differed on various points.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) saw that the Slavonic question had become one of those fashionable distractions which succeed one another in providing society with an object and an occupation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) saw, too, that a great many people were taking up the subject from motives of self-interest and self-advertisement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) recognized that the newspapers published a great deal that was superfluous and exaggerated, with the sole aim of attracting attention and outbidding one another.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) saw that in this general movement those who thrust themselves most forward and shouted the loudest were men who had failed and were smarting under a sense of injury--generals without armies, ministers not in the ministry, journalists not on any paper, party leaders without followers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) saw that there was a great deal in it that was frivolous and absurd.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) saw and recognized an unmistakable growing enthusiasm, uniting all classes, with which it was impossible not to sympathize.
<p/>The massacre of men who were fellow Christians, and of the same Slavonic race, excited sympathy for the sufferers and indignation against the oppressors.
<p/>And the heroism of the Servians and Montenegrins struggling for a great cause begot in the whole people a longing to help their brothers not in word but in deed.
<p/>But in this there was another aspect that rejoiced Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/>That was the manifestation of public opinion.
<p/>The public had definitely expressed its desire.
<p/>The soul of the people had, as Sergey Ivanovitch said, found expression.
<p/>And the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) worked in this cause, the more incontestable it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) that it was a cause destined to assume vast dimensions, to create an epoch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) threw himself heart and soul into the service of this great cause, and forgot to think about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) book.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) whole time now was engrossed by it, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) could scarcely manage to answer all the letters and appeals addressed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) worked the whole spring and part of the summer, and it was only in July that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) prepared to go away to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother's in the country.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was going both to rest for a fortnight, and in the very heart of the people, in the farthest wilds of the country, to enjoy the sight of that uplifting of the spirit of the people, of which, like all residents in the capital and big towns, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was fully persuaded.
<p/>Katavasov had long been meaning to carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) promise to stay with Levin, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was going with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 2   Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had only just reached the station of the Kursk line, which was particularly busy and full of people that day, when, looking round for the groom who was following with their things, they saw a party of volunteers driving up in four cabs.
<p/>Ladies met them with bouquets of flowers, and followed by the rushing crowd they went into the station.
<p/>One of the ladies, who had met the volunteers, came out of the hall and addressed Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You too come to see them off?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) asked in French.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm going away myself, princess.
<p/>To my brother's for a holiday.
<p/>Do you always see them off?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>said Sergey Ivanovitch with a hardly perceptible smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that would be impossible!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>answered the princess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it true that eight hundred have been sent from us already?
<p/>Malvinsky wouldn't believe me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More than eight hundred.
<p/>If you reckon those who have been sent not directly from Moscow, over a thousand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>answered Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!
<p/>That's just what I said!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>exclaimed the lady.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it's true too, I suppose, that more than a million has been subscribed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, princess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say to today's telegram?
<p/>Beaten the Turks again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, so I saw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>answered Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/>They were speaking of the last telegram stating that the Turks had been for three days in succession beaten at all points and put to flight, and that tomorrow a decisive engagement was expected.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, by the way, a splendid young fellow has asked leave to go, and they've made some difficulty, I don't know why.
<p/>I meant to ask you; I know him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>); please write a note about his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) case.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s being sent by Countess Lidia Ivanovna.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>Sergey Ivanovitch asked for all the details the princess knew about the young man, and going into the first-class waiting-room, wrote a note to the person on whom the granting of leave of absence depended, and handed it to the princess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know Count Vronsky, the notorious one...is going by this train?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>said the princess with a smile full of triumph and meaning, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) again and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) the letter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was going, but I did not know when.
<p/>By this train?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>)'s here: there's only his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) mother seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) off.
<p/>It's the best thing, anyway, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) could do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>While they were talking the crowd streamed by them into the dining room.
<p/>They went forward too, and heard a gentleman with a glass in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand delivering a loud discourse to the volunteers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the service of religion, humanity, and our brothers,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>the gentleman said, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) voice growing louder and louder; <div class="bookquote">``to this great cause mother Moscow dedicates you with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) blessing.
<p/>Jivio! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) concluded, loudly and tearfully.
<p/>Everyone shouted  Jivio!
<p/>and a fresh crowd dashed into the hall, almost carrying the princess off her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) legs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, princess!
<p/>that was something like!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div><p/>said Stepan Arkadyevitch, suddenly appearing in the middle of the crowd and beaming upon them with a delighted smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Capitally, warmly said, wasn't it?
<p/>Bravo!
<p/>And Sergey Ivanovitch!
<p/>Why, you ought to have said something--just a few words, you know, to encourage them; you do that so well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) added with a soft, respectful, and discreet smile, moving Sergey Ivanovitch forward a little by the arm.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm just off.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To the country, to my brother's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>answered Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you'll see my wife.
<p/>I've written to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but you'll see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) first.
<p/>Please tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that they've seen me and that it's `all right,' as the English say.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll understand.
<p/>Oh, and be so good as to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) I'm appointed secretary of the committee....
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll understand!
<p/>You know,  les petites mis√®res de la vie humaine, ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) said, as it were apologizing to the princess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Princess Myakaya--not Liza, but Bibish--is sending a thousand guns and twelve nurses.
<p/>Did I tell you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I heard so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>answered Koznishev indifferently.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a pity you're going away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stepan Arkadyevitch</b></font>)</div>said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tomorrow we're giving a dinner to two who're setting off-- Dimer-Bartnyansky from Petersburg and our Veslovsky, Grisha.
<p/>They're both going.
<p/>Veslovsky's only lately married.
<p/>There's a fine fellow for you!
<p/>Eh, princess?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) turned to the lady.
<p/>The princess looked at Koznishev without replying.
<p/>But the fact that Sergey Ivanovitch and the princess seemed anxious to get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) did not in the least disconcert Stepan Arkadyevitch.
<p/>Smiling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) stared at the feather in the princess's hat, and then about him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) were going to pick something up.
<p/>Seeing a lady approaching with a collecting box, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) beckoned her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) up and put in a five-rouble note.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can never see these collecting boxes unmoved while I've money in my pocket,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how about today's telegram?
<p/>Fine chaps those Montenegrins!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't say so!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) cried, when the princess told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) that Vronsky was going by this train.
<p/>For an instant Stepan Arkadyevitch's face looked sad, but a minute later, when, stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mustaches and swinging as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) walked, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) went into the hall where Vronsky was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) had completely forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) own despairing sobs over his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) sister's corpse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) saw in Vronsky only a hero and an old friend.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``With all his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) faults one can't refuse to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) justice,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess to Sergey Ivanovitch as soon as Stepan Arkadyevitch had left them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a typically Russian, Slav nature!
<p/>Only, I'm afraid it won't be pleasant for Vronsky to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Say what you will, I'm touched by that man's fate.
<p/>Do talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a little on the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div>said the princess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, perhaps, if it happens so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never liked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>But this atones for a great deal.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s not merely going himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s taking a squadron at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own expense.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, so I heard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A bell sounded.
<p/>Everyone crowded to the doors.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the princess</b></font>)</div><p/>said the princess, indicating Vronsky, who with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mother on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) arm walked by, wearing a long overcoat and wide-brimmed black hat.
<p/>Oblonsky was walking beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), talking eagerly of something.
<p/>Vronsky was frowning and looking straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>), as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) did not hear what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying.
<p/>Probably on Oblonsky's pointing them out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) looked round in the direction where the princess and Sergey Ivanovitch were standing, and without speaking lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) hat.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) face, aged and worn by suffering, looked stony.
<p/>Going onto the platform, Vronsky left his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) mother and disappeared into a compartment.
<p/>On the platform there rang out <div class="bookquote">``God save the Tsar,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>then shouts of <div class="bookquote">``hurrah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>and  <div class="bookquote">``jivio!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the volunteers</b></font>)</div><p/>One of the volunteers, a tall, very young man with a hollow chest, was particularly conspicuous, bowing and waving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt hat and a nosegay over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.
<p/>Then two officers emerged, bowing too, and a stout man with a big beard, wearing a greasy forage cap.
<p/>Chapter 3   Saying good-bye to the princess, Sergey Ivanovitch was joined by Katavasov; together they got into a carriage full to overflowing, and the train started.
<p/>At Tsaritsino station the train was met by a chorus of young men singing <div class="bookquote">``Hail to Thee!''
 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>Again the volunteers bowed and poked their heads out, but Sergey Ivanovitch paid no attention to them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had had so much to do with the volunteers that the type was familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) and did not interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Katavasov, whose scientific work had prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) having a chance of observing them hitherto, was very much interested in them and questioned Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) to go into the second-class and talk to them himself.
<p/>At the next station Katavasov acted on this suggestion.
<p/>At the first stop he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) moved into the second-class and made the acquaintance of the volunteers.
<p/>They were sitting in a corner of the carriage, talking loudly and obviously aware that the attention of the passengers and Katavasov as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) got in was concentrated upon them.
<p/>More loudly than all talked the tall, hollow-chested young man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was unmistakably tipsy, and was relating some story that had occurred at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) school.
<p/>Facing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat a middle-aged officer in the Austrian military jacket of the Guards uniform.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was listening with a smile to the hollow- chested youth, and occasionally pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up.
<p/>The third, in an artillery uniform, was sitting on a box beside them.
<p/>A fourth was asleep.
<p/>Entering into conversation with the youth, Katavasov learned that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a wealthy Moscow merchant who had run through a large fortune before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was two-and-twenty.
<p/>Katavasov did not like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was unmanly and effeminate and sickly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was obviously convinced, especially now after drinking, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was performing a heroic action, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bragged of it in the most unpleasant way.
<p/>The second, the retired officer, made an unpleasant impression too upon Katavasov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was, it seemed, a man who had tried everything.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had been on a railway, had been a land-steward, and had started factories, and he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) talked, quite without necessity, of all he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had done, and used learned expressions quite inappropriately.
<p/>The third, the artilleryman, on the contrary, struck Katavasov very favorably.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was a quiet, modest fellow, unmistakably impressed by the knowledge of the officer and the heroic self-sacrifice of the merchant and saying nothing about himself.
<p/>When Katavasov asked him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) what had impelled him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) to go to Servia, he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) answered modestly:  <div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, everyone's going.
<p/>The Servians want help, too.
<p/>I'm sorry for them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you artillerymen especially are scarce there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div>said Katavasov.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I wasn't long in the artillery, maybe they'll put me into the infantry or the cavalry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Into the infantry when they need artillery more than anything?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div><p/>said Katavasov, fancying from the artilleryman's apparent age that he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) must have reached a fairly high grade.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wasn't long in the artillery; I'm a cadet retired,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cadet</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cadet</b></font>) began to explain how he (<font color='blue'><b>cadet</b></font>) had failed in his (<font color='blue'><b>cadet</b></font>) examination.
<p/>All of this together made a disagreeable impression on Katavasov, and when the volunteers got out at a station for a drink, Katavasov would have liked to compare his (<font color='blue'><b>cadet</b></font>) unfavorable impression in conversation with someone.
<p/>There was an old man in the carriage, wearing a military overcoat, who had been listening all the while to Katavasov's conversation with the volunteers.
<p/>When they were left alone, Katavasov addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What different positions they come from, all those fellows who are going off there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div>Katavasov said vaguely, not wishing to express his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own opinion, and at the same time anxious to find out the old man's views.
<p/>The old man was an officer who had served on two campaigns.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew what makes a soldier, and judging by the appearance and the talk of those persons, by the swagger with which they had recourse to the bottle on the journey, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) considered them poor soldiers.
<p/>Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lived in a district town, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was longing to tell how one soldier had volunteered from his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) town, a drunkard and a thief whom no one would employ as a laborer.
<p/>But knowing by experience that in the present condition of the public temper it was dangerous to express an opinion opposed to the general one, and especially to criticize the volunteers unfavorably, he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) too watched Katavasov without committing himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, men are wanted there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) said, laughing with his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>And they fell to talking of the last war news, and each concealed from the other his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) perplexity as to the engagement expected next day, since the Turks had been beaten, according to the latest news, at all points.
<p/>And so they parted, neither giving expression to his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) opinion.
<p/>Katavasov went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) own carriage, and with reluctant hypocrisy reported to Sergey Ivanovitch his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) observations of the volunteers, from which it would appear that they were capital fellows.
<p/>At a big station at a town the volunteers were again greeted with shouts and singing, again men and women with collecting boxes appeared, and provincial ladies brought bouquets to the volunteers and followed them into the refreshment room; but all this was on a much smaller and feebler scale than in Moscow.
<p/>Chapter 4   While the train was stopping at the provincial town, Sergey Ivanovitch did not go to the refreshment room, but walked up and down the platform.
<p/>The first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) passed Vronsky's compartment he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) noticed that the curtain was drawn over the window; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) passed it the second time he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) saw the old countess at the window.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) beckoned to Koznishev.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going, you see, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) as far as Kursk,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, so I heard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, standing at her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) window and peeping in.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a noble act on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) part!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) added, noticing that Vronsky was not in the compartment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) misfortune, what was there for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) to do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a terrible thing it was!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>said Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, what I have been through!
<p/>But do get in....  Ah, what I have been through!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) repeated, when Sergey Ivanovitch had got in and sat down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't conceive it!
<p/>For six weeks he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) did not speak to anyone, and would not touch food except when I implored him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>And not for one minute could we leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) alone.
<p/>We took away everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) could have used against himself.
<p/>We lived on the ground floor, but there was no reckoning on anything.
<p/>You know, of course, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had shot himself once already on her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) account,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) said, and the old lady's eyelashes twitched at the recollection.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, hers was the fitting end for such a woman.
<p/>Even the death she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chose was low and vulgar.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not for us to judge, countess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch; <div class="bookquote">``but I can understand that it has been very hard for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, don't speak of it!
<p/>I was staying on my estate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was with me.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) wrote an answer and sent it off.
<p/>We hadn't an idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) was close by at the station.
<p/>In the evening I had only just gone to my room, when my Mary told me a lady had thrown herself under the train.
<p/>Something seemed to strike me at once.
<p/>I knew it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>The first thing I said was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was not to be told.
<p/>But they'd told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) already.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) coachman was there and saw it all.
<p/>When I ran into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was beside himself--it was fearful to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) didn't say a word, but galloped off there.
<p/>I don't know to this day what happened there, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was brought back at death's door.
<p/>I shouldn't have known him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was an awful time!

<p/>Chapter 5   In the slanting evening shadows cast by the baggage piled up on the platform, Vronsky in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) long overcoat and slouch hat, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) pockets, strode up and down, like a wild beast in a cage, turning sharply after twenty paces.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch fancied, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), that Vronsky saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) but was pretending not to see.
<p/>This did not affect Sergey Ivanovitch in the slightest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was above all personal considerations with Vronsky.
<p/>At that moment Sergey Ivanovitch looked upon Vronsky as a man taking an important part in a great cause, and Koznishev thought it his (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) duty to encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) and express his (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) approval.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>).
<p/>Vronsky stood still, looked intently at him (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>), recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>), and going a few steps forward to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>), shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Koznishev</b></font>) very warmly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly you didn't wish to see me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, <div class="bookquote">``but couldn't I be of use to you?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't mind, let's walk on.

<p/>Anyone's welcome to it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vronsky/Alexander/Alexander Vronsky</b></font>)</div><p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) jaw twitched impatiently from the incessant gnawing toothache, that prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Vronsky</b></font>) from even speaking with a natural expression.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will become another man, I predict,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, feeling touched.

<p/>Vronsky warmly pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) outstretched hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, as a weapon I may be of some use.
<p/>But as a man, I'm a wreck,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jerked out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hardly speak for the throbbing ache in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strong teeth, that were like rows of ivory in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was silent, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes rested on the wheels of the tender, slowly and smoothly rolling along the rails.
<p/>And all at once a different pain, not an ache, but an inner trouble, that set his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole being in anguish, made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for an instant forget his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) toothache.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glanced at the tender and the rails, under the influence of the conversation with a friend he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had not met since his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) misfortune, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) suddenly recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) --that is, what was left of her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had run like one distraught into the cloak room of the railway station--on the table, shamelessly sprawling out among strangers, the bloodstained body so lately full of life; the head unhurt dropping back with its weight of hair, and the curling tresses about the temples, and the exquisite face, with red, half-opened mouth, the strange, fixed expression, piteous on the lips and awful in the still open eyes, that seemed to utter that fearful phrase--that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would be sorry for it--that she (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had said when they were quarreling.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tried to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) the first time, at a railway station too, mysterious, exquisite, loving, seeking and giving happiness, and not cruelly revengeful as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) on that last moment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tried to recall his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) best moments with her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), but those moments were poisoned forever.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could only think of her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as triumphant, successful in her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) menace of a wholly useless remorse never to be effaced.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lost all consciousness of toothache, and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) face worked with sobs.
<p/>Passing twice up and down beside the baggage in silence and regaining his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) self-possession, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) addressed Sergey Ivanovitch calmly:  <div class="bookquote">``You have had no telegrams since yesterday's?
<p/>Yes, driven back for a third time, but a decisive engagement expected for tomorrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>And after talking a little more of King Milan's proclamation, and the immense effect it might have, they parted, going to their carriages on hearing the second bell.
<p/>Chapter 6   Sergey Ivanovitch had not telegraphed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother to send to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) did not know when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) should be able to leave Moscow.
<p/>Levin was not at home when Katavasov and Sergey Ivanovitch in a fly hired at the station drove up to the steps of the Pokrovskoe house, as black as Moors from the dust of the road.
<p/>Kitty, sitting on the balcony with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father and sister, recognized her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) brother-in-law, and ran down to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a shame not to have let us know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) hand to Sergey Ivanovitch, and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) forehead up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) to kiss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov, a professor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said.

<p/>This was not a mere guess; her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) connection with the child was still so close, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could gauge by the flow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) milk his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) need of food, and knew for certain he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was hungry.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was crying before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) reached the nursery.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and hastened.
<p/>But the faster she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) went, the louder he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) screamed.
<p/>It was a fine healthy scream, hungry and impatient.

<p/>There, tie the cap afterwards, do!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The baby</b></font>)</div><p/>The baby's greedy scream was passing into sobs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you can't manage so, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Agafea Mihalovna</b></font>)</div>said Agafea Mihalovna, who was almost always to be found in the nursery.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) chanted over him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), paying no attention to the mother.
<p/>The nurse brought the baby to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother.
<p/>Agafea Mihalovna followed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with a face dissolving with tenderness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knows me, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knows me.

<p/>Their impatience hindered things for a while.
<p/>The baby could not get hold of the breast right, and was furious.

<p/>To Agafea Mihalovna, to the nurse, to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grandfather, to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father even, Mitya was a living being, requiring only material care, but for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had long been a mortal being, with whom there had been a whole series of spiritual relations already.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wakes up, please God, you shall see for yourself.

 (<font color='red'><b>Agafea Mihalovna</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 7   Agafea Mihalovna went out on tiptoe; the nurse let down the blind, chased a fly out from under the muslin canopy of the crib, and a bumblebee struggling on the window-frame, and sat down waving a faded branch of birch over the mother and the baby.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How hot it is!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, sh--sh--sh--''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>was all Kitty answered, rocking a little, and tenderly squeezing the plump little arm, with rolls of fat at the wrist, which Mitya still waved feebly as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) opened and shut his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>That hand worried Kitty; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) longed to kiss the little hand, but was afraid to for fear of waking the baby.
<p/>At last the little hand ceased waving, and the eyes closed.
<p/>Only from time to time, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went on sucking, the baby raised his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) long, curly eyelashes and peeped at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother with wet eyes, that looked black in the twilight.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), confessing that for an unbeliever there can be no salvation, and loving her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband's soul more than anything in the world, thought with a smile of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) unbelief, and told herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was absurd.

<p/>If it's all wrong, why does he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) read them?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) says himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would like to believe.
<p/>Then why is it he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) doesn't believe?
<p/>Surely from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thinking so much?
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thinks so much from being solitary.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s always alone, alone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) can't talk about it all to us.
<p/>I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'ll be glad of these visitors, especially Katavasov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) likes discussions with them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) thought, and passed instantly to the consideration of where it would be more convenient to put Katavasov, to sleep alone or to share Sergey Ivanovitch's room.
<p/>And then an idea suddenly struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) shudder and even disturb Mitya, who glanced severely at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do believe the laundress hasn't sent the washing yet, and all the best sheets are in use.
<p/>If I don't see to it, Agafea Mihalovna will give Sergey Ivanovitch the wrong sheets,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>and at the very idea of this the blood rushed to Kitty's face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will arrange it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) decided, and going back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) former thoughts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) remembered that some spiritual question of importance had been interrupted, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) began to recall what.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Kostya, an unbeliever,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) thought again with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, an unbeliever then!
<p/>Better let him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) always be one than like Madame Stahl, or what I tried to be in those days abroad.
<p/>No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stahl</b></font>) won't ever sham anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And a recent instance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stahl</b></font>) goodness rose vividly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mind.
<p/>A fortnight ago a penitent letter had come from Stepan Arkadyevitch to Dolly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stahl</b></font>) besought her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Stahl</b></font>) honor, to sell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) estate to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Stahl</b></font>) debts.
<p/>Dolly was in despair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) detested her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) husband, despised him (<font color='blue'><b>Stahl</b></font>), pitied him (<font color='blue'><b>Stahl</b></font>), resolved on a separation, resolved to refuse, but ended by agreeing to sell part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) property.
<p/>After that, with an irrepressible smile of tenderness, Kitty recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband's shamefaced embarrassment, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) repeated awkward efforts to approach the subject, and how at last, having thought of the one means of helping Dolly without wounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) pride, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had suggested to Kitty--what had not occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) before--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) should give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) share of the property.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) an unbeliever indeed!
<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dread of offending anyone, even a child!
<p/>Everything for others, nothing for himself.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch simply considers it as Kostya's duty to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) steward.
<p/>And it's the same with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) sister.
<p/>Now Dolly and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) children are under his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) guardianship; all these peasants who come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) every day, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) were bound to be at their service.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, only be like your father, only like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said, handing Mitya over to the nurse, and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) lips to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cheek.
<p/>Chapter 8   Ever since, by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) beloved brother's deathbed, Levin had first glanced into the questions of life and death in the light of these new convictions, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) called them, which had during the period from his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) twentieth to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thirty-fourth year imperceptibly replaced his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) childish and youthful beliefs--he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been stricken with horror, not so much of death, as of life, without any knowledge of whence, and why, and how, and what it was.
<p/>The physical organization, its decay, the indestructibility of matter, the law of the conservation of energy, evolution, were the words which usurped the place of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) old belief.
<p/>These words and the ideas associated with them were very well for intellectual purposes.
<p/>But for life they yielded nothing, and Levin felt suddenly like a man who has changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) warm fur cloak for a muslin garment, and going for the first time into the frost is immediately convinced, not by reason, but by his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) whole nature that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) is as good as naked, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must infallibly perish miserably.
<p/>From that moment, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not distinctly face it, and still went on living as before, Levin had never lost this sense of terror at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lack of knowledge.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) vaguely felt, too, that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) called his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) new convictions were not merely lack of knowledge, but that they were part of a whole order of ideas, in which no knowledge of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) needed was possible.
<p/>At first, marriage, with the new joys and duties bound up with it, had completely crowded out these thoughts.
<p/>But of late, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was staying in Moscow after his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife's confinement, with nothing to do, the question that clamored for solution had more and more often, more and more insistently, haunted Levin's mind.
<p/>The question was summed up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thus: <div class="bookquote">``If I do not accept the answers Christianity gives to the problems of my life, what answers do I accept?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And in the whole arsenal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) convictions, so far from finding any satisfactory answers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was utterly unable to find anything at all like an answer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was in the position of a man seeking food in toy shops and tool shops.
<p/>Instinctively, unconsciously, with every book, with every conversation, with every man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was on the lookout for light on these questions and their solution.
<p/>What puzzled and distracted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) above everything was that the majority of men of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age and circle had, like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), exchanged their old beliefs for the same new convictions, and yet saw nothing to lament in this, and were perfectly satisfied and serene.
<p/>So that, apart from the principal question, Levin was tortured by other questions too.
<p/>Were these people sincere?
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) asked himself, or were they playing a part?
<p/>or was it that they understood the answers science gave to these problems in some different, clearer sense than he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did?
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) assiduously studied both these men's opinions and the books which treated of these scientific explanations.
<p/>One fact he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had found out since these questions had engrossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind, was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been quite wrong in supposing from the recollections of the circle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) young days at college, that religion had outlived its day, and that it was now practically non-existent.
<p/>All the people nearest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) who were good in their lives were believers.
<p/>The old prince, and Lvov, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) liked so much, and Sergey Ivanovitch, and all the women believed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) wife believed as simply as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had believed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) earliest childhood, and ninety-nine hundredths of the Russian people, all the working people for whose life he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) felt the deepest respect, believed.
<p/>Another fact of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) became convinced, after reading many scientific books, was that the men who shared his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) views had no other construction to put on them, and that they gave no explanation of the questions which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) could not live without answering, but simply ignored their existence and attempted to explain other questions of no possible interest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), such as the evolution of organisms, the materialistic theory of consciousness, and so forth.
<p/>Moreover, during his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) wife's confinement, something had happened that seemed extraordinary to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), an unbeliever, had fallen into praying, and at the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) prayed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) believed.
<p/>But that moment had passed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) could not make his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) state of mind at that moment fit into the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) could not admit that at that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) knew the truth, and that now he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was wrong; for as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) began thinking calmly about it, it all fell to pieces.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) could not admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was mistaken then, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) spiritual condition then was precious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), and to admit that it was a proof of weakness would have been to desecrate those moments.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was miserably divided against himself, and strained all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) spiritual forces to the utmost to escape from this condition.
<p/>Chapter 9   These doubts fretted and harassed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), growing weaker or stronger from time to time, but never leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) read and thought, and the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) read and the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) thought, the further he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) felt from the aim he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was pursuing.
<p/>Of late in Moscow and in the country, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had become convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) would find no solution in the materialists, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had read and re-read thoroughly Plato, Spinoza, Kant, Schelling, Hegel, and Schopenhauer, the philosophers who gave a non-materialistic explanation of life.
<p/>Their ideas seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hegel</b></font>) fruitful when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hegel</b></font>) was reading or was himself seeking arguments to refute other theories, especially those of the materialists; but as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hegel</b></font>) began to read or sought for himself a solution of problems, the same thing always happened.
<p/>As long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hegel</b></font>) followed the fixed definition of obscure words such as  spirit, will, freedom, essence,  purposely letting himself go into the snare of words the philosophers set for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hegel</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Hegel</b></font>) seemed to comprehend something.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hegel</b></font>) had only to forget the artificial train of reasoning, and to turn from life itself to what had satisfied him (<font color='blue'><b>Hegel</b></font>) while thinking in accordance with the fixed definitions, and all this artificial edifice fell to pieces at once like a house of cards, and it became clear that the edifice had been built up out of those transposed words, apart from anything in life more important than reason.
<p/>At one time, reading Schopenhauer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hegel</b></font>) put in place of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hegel</b></font>) will the word  love , and for a couple of days this new philosophy charmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hegel</b></font>), till he (<font color='blue'><b>Hegel</b></font>) removed a little away from it.
<p/>But then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hegel</b></font>) turned from life itself to glance at it again, it fell away too, and proved to be the same muslin garment with no warmth in it.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Hegel</b></font>) brother Sergey Ivanovitch advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) to read the theological works of Homiakov.
<p/>Levin read the second volume of Homiakov's works, and in spite of the elegant, epigrammatic, argumentative style which at first repelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was impressed by the doctrine of the church he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) found in them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was struck at first by the idea that the apprehension of divine truths had not been vouchsafed to man, but to a corporation of men bound together by love--to the church.
<p/>What delighted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the thought how much easier it was to believe in a still existing living church, embracing all the beliefs of men, and having God at its head, and therefore holy and infallible, and from it to accept the faith in God, in the creation, the fall, the redemption, than to begin with God, a mysterious, far-away God, the creation, etc..
<p/>But afterwards, on reading a Catholic writer's history of the church, and then a Greek orthodox writer's history of the church, and seeing that the two churches, in their very conception infallible, each deny the authority of the other, Homiakov's doctrine of the church lost all its charm for him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>), and this edifice crumbled into dust like the philosophers' edifices.
<p/>All that spring he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) was not himself, and went through fearful moments of horror.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Without knowing what I am and why I am here, life's impossible; and that I can't know, and so I can't live,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin said to himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In infinite time, in infinite matter, in infinite space, is formed a bubble-organism, and that bubble lasts a while and bursts, and that bubble is Me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>ages</b></font>)</div><p/>It was an agonizing error, but it was the sole logical result of ages of human thought in that direction.
<p/>This was the ultimate belief on which all the systems elaborated by human thought in almost all their ramifications rested.
<p/>It was the prevalent conviction, and of all other explanations Levin had unconsciously, not knowing when or how, chosen it, as anyway the clearest, and made it his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own.
<p/>But it was not merely a falsehood, it was the cruel jeer of some wicked power, some evil, hateful power, to whom one could not submit.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must escape from this power.
<p/>And the means of escape every man had in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own hands.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had but to cut short this dependence on evil.
<p/>And there was one means--death.
<p/>And Levin, a happy father and husband, in perfect health, was several times so near suicide that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hid the cord that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) might not be tempted to hang himself, and was afraid to go out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gun for fear of shooting himself.
<p/>But Levin did not shoot himself, and did not hang himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went on living.
<p/>Chapter 10   When Levin thought what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was living for, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could find no answer to the questions and was reduced to despair, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) left off questioning himself about it.
<p/>It seemed as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew both what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was and for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was living, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) acted and lived resolutely and without hesitation.
<p/>Indeed, in these latter days he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was far more decided and unhesitating in life than he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had ever been.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went back to the country at the beginning of June, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went back also to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) usual pursuits.
<p/>The management of the estate, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) relations with the peasants and the neighbors, the care of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) household, the management of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) sister's and brother's property, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had the direction, his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) relations with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife and kindred, the care of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) child, and the new bee-keeping hobby he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had taken up that spring, filled all his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) time.
<p/>These things occupied him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) now, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) justified them to himself by any sort of general principles, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had done in former days; on the contrary, disappointed by the failure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) former efforts for the general welfare, and too much occupied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own thought and the mass of business with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was burdened from all sides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had completely given up thinking of the general good, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) busied himself with all this work simply because it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was doing--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not do otherwise.
<p/>In former days--almost from childhood, and increasingly up to full manhood--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had tried to do anything that would be good for all, for humanity, for Russia, for the whole village, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had noticed that the idea of it had been pleasant, but the work itself had always been incoherent, that then he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had never had a full conviction of its absolute necessity, and that the work that had begun by seeming so great, had grown less and less, till it vanished into nothing.
<p/>But now, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) marriage, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had begun to confine himself more and more to living for himself, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) experienced no delight at all at the thought of the work he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was doing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt a complete conviction of its necessity, saw that it succeeded far better than in old days, and that it kept on growing more and more.
<p/>Now, involuntarily it seemed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) cut more and more deeply into the soil like a plough, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not be drawn out without turning aside the furrow.
<p/>To live the same family life as his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) father and forefathers--that is, in the same condition of culture--and to bring up his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) children in the same, was incontestably necessary.
<p/>It was as necessary as dining when one was hungry.
<p/>And to do this, just as it was necessary to cook dinner, it was necessary to keep the mechanism of agriculture at Pokrovskoe going so as to yield an income.
<p/>Just as incontestably as it was necessary to repay a debt was it necessary to keep the property in such a condition that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) son, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) received it as a heritage, would say <div class="bookquote">``thank you''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) father as Levin had said <div class="bookquote">``thank you''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) grandfather for all he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) built and planted.
<p/>And to do this it was necessary to look after the land himself, not to let it, and to breed cattle, manure the fields, and plant timber.
<p/>It was impossible not to look after the affairs of Sergey Ivanovitch, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) sister, of the peasants who came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) for advice and were accustomed to do so--as impossible as to fling down a child one is carrying in one's arms.
<p/>It was necessary to look after the comfort of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) sister-in-law and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) children, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) wife and baby, and it was impossible not to spend with them at least a short time each day.
<p/>And all this, together with shooting and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) new bee-keeping, filled up the whole of Levin's life, which had no meaning at all for him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) began to think.
<p/>But besides knowing thoroughly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to do, Levin knew in just the same way  how  he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had to do it all, and what was more important than the rest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must hire laborers as cheaply as possible; but to hire men under bond, paying them in advance at less than the current rate of wages, was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must not do, even though it was very profitable.
<p/>Selling straw to the peasants in times of scarcity of provender was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) might do, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt sorry for them; but the tavern and the pothouse must be put down, though they were a source of income.
<p/>Felling timber must be punished as severely as possible, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not exact forfeits for cattle being driven onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fields; and though it annoyed the keeper and made the peasants not afraid to graze their cattle on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) land, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not keep their cattle as a punishment.
<p/>To Pyotr, who was paying a money-lender 10 per cent.
<p/>a month, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must lend a sum of money to set him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) free.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not let off peasants who did not pay their rent, nor let them fall into arrears.
<p/>It was impossible to overlook the bailiff's not having mown the meadows and letting the hay spoil; and it was equally impossible to mow those acres where a young copse had been planted.
<p/>It was impossible to excuse a laborer who had gone home in the busy season because his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) father was dying, however sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) might feel for him (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) must subtract from his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) pay those costly months of idleness.
<p/>But it was impossible not to allow monthly rations to the old servants who were of no use for anything.
<p/>Levin knew that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) got home he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must first of all go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife, who was unwell, and that the peasants who had been waiting for three hours to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could wait a little longer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew too that, regardless of all the pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt in taking a swarm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must forego that pleasure, and leave the old man to see to the bees alone, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) talked to the peasants who had come after him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to the bee-house.
<p/>Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) were acting rightly or wrongly he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not know, and far from trying to prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was, nowadays he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) avoided all thought or talk about it.
<p/>Reasoning had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to doubt, and prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) from seeing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ought to do and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ought not.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not think, but simply lived, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was continually aware of the presence of an infallible judge in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) soul, determining which of two possible courses of action was the better and which was the worse, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not act rightly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was at once aware of it.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) lived, not knowing and not seeing any chance of knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was living for, and harassed at this lack of knowledge to such a point that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was afraid of suicide, and yet firmly laying down his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own individual definite path in life.
<p/>Chapter 11   The day on which Sergey Ivanovitch came to Pokrovskoe was one of Levin's most painful days.
<p/>It was the very busiest working time, when all the peasantry show an extraordinary intensity of self-sacrifice in labor, such as is never shown in any other conditions of life, and would be highly esteemed if the men who showed these qualities themselves thought highly of them, and if it were not repeated every year, and if the results of this intense labor were not so simple.
<p/>To reap and bind the rye and oats and to carry it, to mow the meadows, turn over the fallows, thrash the seed and sow the winter corn--all this seems so simple and ordinary; but to succeed in getting through it all everyone in the village, from the old man to the young child, must toil incessantly for three or four weeks, three times as hard as usual, living on rye-beer, onions, and black bread, thrashing and carrying the sheaves at night, and not giving more than two or three hours in the twenty-four to sleep.
<p/>And every year this is done all over Russia.
<p/>Having lived the greater part of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life in the country and in the closest relations with the peasants, Levin always felt in this busy time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was infected by this general quickening of energy in the people.
<p/>In the early morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) rode over to the first sowing of the rye, and to the oats, which were being carried to the stacks, and returning home at the time his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife and sister-in-law were getting up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) drank coffee with them and walked to the farm, where a new thrashing machine was to be set working to get ready the seed-corn.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was standing in the cool granary, still fragrant with the leaves of the hazel branches interlaced on the freshly peeled aspen beams of the new thatch roof.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gazed through the open door in which the dry bitter dust of the thrashing whirled and played, at the grass of the thrashing floor in the sunlight and the fresh straw that had been brought in from the barn, then at the speckly-headed, white-breasted swallows that flew chirping in under the roof and, fluttering their wings, settled in the crevices of the doorway, then at the peasants bustling in the dark, dusty barn, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought strange thoughts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is it all being done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why am I standing here, making them work?
<p/>What are they all so busy for, trying to show their zeal before me?
<p/>What is that old Matrona, my old friend, toiling for?
<p/>-LRB-I doctored her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), when the beam fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) in the fire-RRB-''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thought, looking at a thin old woman who was raking up the grain, moving painfully with her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) bare, sun-blackened feet over the uneven, rough floor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) recovered, but today or tomorrow or in ten years she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) won't; they'll bury her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), and nothing will be left either of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) or of that smart girl in the red jacket, who with that skillful, soft action shakes the ears out of their husks.
<p/>They'll bury her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) and this piebald horse, and very soon too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thought, gazing at the heavily moving, panting horse that kept walking up the wheel that turned under him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And they will bury her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) and Fyodor the thrasher with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodor</b></font>) curly beard full of chaff and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodor</b></font>) shirt torn on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodor</b></font>) white shoulders--they will bury him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodor</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodor</b></font>)'s untying the sheaves, and giving orders, and shouting to the women, and quickly setting straight the strap on the moving wheel.
<p/>And what's more, it's not them alone--me they'll bury too, and nothing will be left.
<p/>What for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodor</b></font>) thought this, and at the same time looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodor</b></font>) watch to reckon how much they thrashed in an hour.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodor</b></font>) wanted to know this so as to judge by it the task to set for the day.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll soon be one, and they're only beginning the third sheaf,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>thought Levin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went up to the man that was feeding the machine, and shouting over the roar of the machine he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to put it in more slowly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You put in too much at a time, Fyodor.
<p/>Do you see--it gets choked, that's why it isn't getting on.
<p/>Do it evenly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor/Ryezunov/Fyodor Ryezunov</b></font>)</div><p/>Fyodor, black with the dust that clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodor</b></font>) moist face, shouted something in response, but still went on doing it as Levin did not want him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to.
<p/>Levin, going up to the machine, moved Fyodor aside, and began feeding the corn in himself.
<p/>Working on till the peasants' dinner hour, which was not long in coming, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodor</b></font>) went out of the barn with Fyodor and fell into talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodor</b></font>), stopping beside a neat yellow sheaf of rye laid on the thrashing floor for seed.
<p/>Fyodor came from a village at some distance from the one in which Levin had once allotted land to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) cooperative association.
<p/>Now it had been let to a former house porter.
<p/>Levin talked to Fyodor about this land and asked whether Platon, a well-to-do peasant of good character belonging to the same village, would not take the land for the coming year.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a high rent; it wouldn't pay Platon, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>the peasant</b></font>)</div>answered the peasant, picking the ears off his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitrievitch</b></font>) sweat-drenched shirt.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how does Kirillov make it pay?''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lives for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How thinks of God?
<p/>How does he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) live for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin almost shouted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, to be sure, in truth, in God's way.
<p/>Folks are different.
<p/>Take you now, you wouldn't wrong a man...''   (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, good-bye!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, breathless with excitement, and turning round he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stick and walked quickly away towards home.
<p/>At the peasant's words that Fokanitch lived for his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) soul, in truth, in God's way, undefined but significant ideas seemed to burst out as though they had been locked up, and all striving towards one goal, they thronged whirling through his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head, blinding him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with their light.
<p/>Chapter 12   Levin strode along the highroad, absorbed not so much in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thoughts -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not yet disentangle them-RRB- as in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) spiritual condition, unlike anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had experienced before.
<p/>The words uttered by the peasant had acted on his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) soul like an electric shock, suddenly transforming and combining into a single whole the whole swarm of disjointed, impotent, separate thoughts that incessantly occupied his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) mind.
<p/>These thoughts had unconsciously been in his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) mind even when he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was talking about the land.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was aware of something new in his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) soul, and joyfully tested this new thing, not yet knowing what it was.
<p/>``Not living for his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) own wants, but for God?
<p/>For what God?
<p/>And could one say anything more senseless than what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said that one must not live for one's own wants, that is, that one must not live for what we understand, what we are attracted by, what we desire, but must live for something incomprehensible, for God, whom no one can understand nor even define.
<p/>What of it?
<p/>Didn't I understand those senseless words of Fyodor's?
<p/>And understanding them, did I doubt of their truth?
<p/>Did I think them stupid, obscure, inexact?
<p/>No, I understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodor</b></font>), and exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodor</b></font>) understands the words.
<p/>I understood them more fully and clearly than I understand anything in life, and never in my life have I doubted nor can I doubt about it.
<p/>And not only I, but everyone, the whole world understands nothing fully but this, and about this only they have no doubt and are always agreed.
<p/>``And I looked out for miracles, complained that I did not see a miracle which would convince me.
<p/>A material miracle would have persuaded me.
<p/>And here is a miracle, the sole miracle possible, continually existing, surrounding me on all sides, and I never noticed it!
<p/>``Fyodor says that Kirillov lives for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodor</b></font>) belly.
<p/>That's comprehensible and rational.
<p/>All of us as rational beings can't do anything else but live for our belly.
<p/>And all of a sudden the same Fyodor says that one mustn't live for one's belly, but must live for truth, for God, and at a hint I understand him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!
<p/>And I and millions of men, men who lived ages ago and men living now-- peasants, the poor in spirit and the learned, who have thought and written about it, in their obscure words saying the same thing--we are all agreed about this one thing: what we must live for and what is good.
<p/>I and all men have only one firm, incontestable, clear knowledge, and that knowledge cannot be explained by the reason--it is outside it, and has no causes and can have no effects.
<p/>``If goodness has causes, it is not goodness; if it has effects, a reward, it is not goodness either.
<p/>So goodness is outside the chain of cause and effect.
<p/>``And yet I know it, and we all know it.
<p/>``What could be a greater miracle than that?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I have found the solution of it all?
<p/>can my sufferings be over?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Levin, striding along the dusty road, not noticing the heat nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) weariness, and experiencing a sense of relief from prolonged suffering.
<p/>This feeling was so delicious that it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) incredible.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was breathless with emotion and incapable of going farther; he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) turned off the road into the forest and lay down in the shade of an aspen on the uncut grass.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hat off his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hot head and lay propped on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) elbow in the lush, feathery, woodland grass.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I must make it clear to myself and understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought, looking intently at the untrampled grass before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and following the movements of a green beetle, advancing along a blade of couch-grass and lifting up in its progress a leaf of goat-weed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have I discovered?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) asked himself, bending aside the leaf of goat-weed out of the beetle's way and twisting another blade of grass above for the beetle to cross over onto it.
<p/>``What is it makes me glad?
<p/>What have I discovered?
<p/>``I have discovered nothing.
<p/>I have only found out what I knew.
<p/>I understand the force that in the past gave me life, and now too gives me life.
<p/>I have been set free from falsity, I have found the Master.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of old I used to say that in my body, that in the body of this grass and of this beetle -LRB-there, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) didn't care for the grass, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s opened her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wings and flown away-RRB-, there was going on a transformation of matter in accordance with physical, chemical, and physiological laws.
<p/>And in all of us, as well as in the aspens and the clouds and the misty patches, there was a process of evolution.
<p/>Evolution from what?
<p/>into what?--Eternal evolution and struggle....  As though there could be any sort of tendency and struggle in the eternal!
<p/>And I was astonished that in spite of the utmost effort of thought along that road I could not discover the meaning of life, the meaning of my impulses and yearnings.
<p/>Now I say that I know the meaning of my life: `To live for God, for my soul.'
<p/>And this meaning, in spite of its clearness, is mysterious and marvelous.
<p/>Such, indeed, is the meaning of everything existing.
<p/>Yes, pride,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said to himself, turning over on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stomach and beginning to tie a noose of blades of grass, trying not to break them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And not merely pride of intellect, but dulness of intellect.
<p/>And most of all, the deceitfulness; yes, the deceitfulness of intellect.
<p/>The cheating knavishness of intellect, that's it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said to himself.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) briefly went through, mentally, the whole course of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ideas during the last two years, the beginning of which was the clear confronting of death at the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dear brother hopelessly ill.  Then, for the first time, grasping that for every man, and himself too, there was nothing in store but suffering, death, and forgetfulness, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind that life was impossible like that, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must either interpret life so that it would not present itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as the evil jest of some devil, or shoot himself.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had not done either, but had gone on living, thinking, and feeling, and had even at that very time married, and had had many joys and had been happy, when he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was not thinking of the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) life.
<p/>What did this mean?
<p/>It meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had been living rightly, but thinking wrongly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had lived -LRB-without being aware of it-RRB- on those spiritual truths that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had sucked in with his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) mother's milk, but he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had thought, not merely without recognition of these truths, but studiously ignoring them.
<p/>Now it was clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) could only live by virtue of the beliefs in which he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had been brought up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What should I have been, and how should I have spent my life, if I had not had these beliefs, if I had not known that I must live for God and not for my own desires?
<p/>I should have robbed and lied and killed.
<p/>Nothing of what makes the chief happiness of my life would have existed for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And with the utmost stretch of imagination he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could not conceive the brutal creature he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would have been himself, if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had not known what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was living for.
<p/>``I looked for an answer to my question.
<p/>And thought could not give an answer to my question--it is incommensurable with my question.
<p/>The answer has been given me by life itself, in my knowledge of what is right and what is wrong.
<p/>And that knowledge I did not arrive at in any way, it was given to me as to all men,  given , because I could not have got it from anywhere.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where could I have got it?
<p/>By reason could I have arrived at knowing that I must love my neighbor and not oppress him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?
<p/>I was told that in my childhood, and I believed it gladly, for they told me what was already in my soul.
<p/>But who discovered it?
<p/>Not reason.
<p/>Reason discovered the struggle for existence, and the law that requires us to oppress all who hinder the satisfaction of our desires.
<p/>That is the deduction of reason.
<p/>But loving one's neighbor reason could never discover, because it's irrational.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 13   And Levin remembered a scene he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had lately witnessed between Dolly and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) children.
<p/>The children, left to themselves, had begun cooking raspberries over the candles and squirting milk into each other's mouths with a syringe.
<p/>Their mother, catching them at these pranks, began reminding them in Levin's presence of the trouble their mischief gave to the grown-up people, and that this trouble was all for their sake, and that if they smashed the cups they would have nothing to drink their tea out of, and that if they wasted the milk, they would have nothing to eat, and die of hunger.
<p/>And Levin had been struck by the passive, weary incredulity with which the children heard what their mother said to them.
<p/>They were simply annoyed that their amusing play had been interrupted, and did not believe a word of what their mother was saying.
<p/>They could not believe it indeed, for they could not take in the immensity of all they habitually enjoyed, and so could not conceive that what they were destroying was the very thing they lived by.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That all comes of itself,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they thought, <div class="bookquote">``and there's nothing interesting or important about it because it has always been so, and always will be so.
<p/>And it's all always the same.
<p/>We've no need to think about that, it's all ready.
<p/>But we want to invent something of our own, and new.
<p/>So we thought of putting raspberries in a cup, and cooking them over a candle, and squirting milk straight into each other's mouths.
<p/>That's fun, and something new, and not a bit worse than drinking out of cups.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it just the same that we do, that I did, searching by the aid of reason for the significance of the forces of nature and the meaning of the life of man?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought.
<p/>``And don't all the theories of philosophy do the same, trying by the path of thought, which is strange and not natural to man, to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to a knowledge of what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has known long ago, and knows so certainly that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not live at all without it?
<p/>Isn't it distinctly to be seen in the development of each philosopher's theory, that he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) knows what is the chief significance of life beforehand, just as positively as the peasant Fyodor, and not a bit more clearly than he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodor</b></font>), and is simply trying by a dubious intellectual path to come back to what everyone knows?
<p/>``Now then, leave the children to themselves to get things alone and make their crockery, get the milk from the cows, and so on.
<p/>Would they be naughty then?
<p/>Why, they'd die of hunger!
<p/>Well, then, leave us with our passions and thoughts, without any idea of the one God, of the Creator, or without any idea of what is right, without any idea of moral evil.
<p/>``Just try and build up anything without those ideas!
<p/>``We only try to destroy them, because we're spiritually provided for.
<p/>Exactly like the children!
<p/>``Whence have I that joyful knowledge, shared with the peasant, that alone gives peace to my soul?
<p/>Whence did I get it?
<p/>``Brought up with an idea of God, a Christian, my whole life filled with the spiritual blessings Christianity has given me, full of them, and living on those blessings, like the children I did not understand them, and destroy, that is try to destroy, what I live by.
<p/>And as soon as an important moment of life comes, like the children when they are cold and hungry, I turn to Him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>), and even less than the children when their mother scolds them for their childish mischief, do I feel that my childish efforts at wanton madness are reckoned against me.
<p/>``Yes, what I know, I know not by reason, but it has been given to me, revealed to me, and I know it with my heart, by faith in the chief thing taught by the church.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The church!
<p/>the church!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin repeated to himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) turned over on the other side, and leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) elbow, fell to gazing into the distance at a herd of cattle crossing over to the river.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But can I believe in all the church teaches?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought, trying himself, and thinking of everything that could destroy his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) present peace of mind.
<p/>Intentionally he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) recalled all those doctrines of the church which had always seemed most strange and had always been a stumbling block to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>``The Creation?
<p/>But how did I explain existence?
<p/>By existence?
<p/>By nothing?
<p/>The devil and sin.
<p/>But how do I explain evil?...
<p/>The atonement?...
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I know nothing, nothing, and I can know nothing but what has been told to me and all men.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) that there was not a single article of faith of the church which could destroy the chief thing--faith in God, in goodness, as the one goal of man's destiny.
<p/>Under every article of faith of the church could be put the faith in the service of truth instead of one's desires.
<p/>And each doctrine did not simply leave that faith unshaken, each doctrine seemed essential to complete that great miracle, continually manifest upon earth, that made it possible for each man and millions of different sorts of men, wise men and imbeciles, old men and children--all men, peasants, Lvov, Kitty, beggars and kings to understand perfectly the same one thing, and to build up thereby that life of the soul which alone is worth living, and which alone is precious to us.
<p/>Lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gazed up now into the high, cloudless sky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I not know that that is infinite space, and that it is not a round arch?
<p/>But, however I screw up my eyes and strain my sight, I cannot see it not round and not bounded, and in spite of my knowing about infinite space, I am incontestably right when I see a solid blue dome, and more right than when I strain my eyes to see beyond it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin ceased thinking, and only, as it were, listened to mysterious voices that seemed talking joyfully and earnestly within him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can this be faith?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought, afraid to believe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) happiness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My God, I thank Thee!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, gulping down his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sobs, and with both hands brushing away the tears that filled his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Chapter 14   Levin looked before him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and saw a herd of cattle, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) caught sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) trap with Raven in the shafts, and the coachman, who, driving up to the herd, said something to the herdsman.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>herdsman</b></font>) heard the rattle of the wheels and the snort of the sleek horse close by him (<font color='blue'><b>herdsman</b></font>).
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>herdsman</b></font>) was so buried in his (<font color='blue'><b>herdsman</b></font>) thoughts that he (<font color='blue'><b>herdsman</b></font>) did not even wonder why the coachman had come for him (<font color='blue'><b>herdsman</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>herdsman</b></font>) only thought of that when the coachman had driven quite up to him (<font color='blue'><b>herdsman</b></font>) and shouted to him (<font color='blue'><b>herdsman</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The mistress sent me.
<p/>Your brother has come, and some gentleman with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin got into the trap and took the reins.
<p/>As though just roused out of sleep, for a long while Levin could not collect his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) faculties.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stared at the sleek horse flecked with lather between his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) haunches and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) neck, where the harness rubbed, stared at Ivan the coachman sitting beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was expecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife was most likely uneasy at his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) long absence, and tried to guess who was the visitor who had come with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother.
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife and the unknown guest seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) now quite different from before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) fancied that now his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) relations with all men would be different.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``With my brother there will be none of that aloofness there always used to be between us, there will be no disputes; with Kitty there shall never be quarrels; with the visitor, whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) may be, I will be friendly and nice; with the servants, with Ivan, it will all be different.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Pulling the stiff rein and holding in the good horse that snorted with impatience and seemed begging to be let go, Levin looked round at Ivan sitting beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), not knowing what to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) unoccupied hand, continually pressing down his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) shirt as it puffed out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tried to find something to start a conversation about with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) would have said that Ivan had pulled the saddle-girth up too high, but that was like blame, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) longed for friendly, warm talk.
<p/>Nothing else occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your honor must keep to the right and mind that stump,''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>said the coachman, pulling the rein Levin held.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't touch and don't teach me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>said Levin, angered by this interference.
<p/>Now, as always, interference made him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) angry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt sorrowfully at once how mistaken had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) supposition that his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) spiritual condition could immediately change him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) in contact with reality.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not a quarter of a mile from home when he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw Grisha and Tanya running to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Uncle Kostya!
<p/>mamma's coming, and grandfather, and Sergey Ivanovitch, and someone else,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they said, clambering up into the trap.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An awfully terrible person!
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) does like this with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) arms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tanya</b></font>)</div>said Tanya, getting up in the trap and mimicking Katavasov.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Old or young?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Levin, laughing, reminded of someone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not know whom, by Tanya's performance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I hope it's not a tiresome person!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>thought Levin.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) turned, at a bend in the road, and saw the party coming, Levin recognized Katavasov in a straw hat, walking along swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) arms just as Tanya had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Katavasov was very fond of discussing metaphysics, having derived his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) notions from natural science writers who had never studied metaphysics, and in Moscow Levin had had many arguments with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) of late.
<p/>And one of these arguments, in which Katavasov had obviously considered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) came off victorious, was the first thing Levin thought of as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, whatever I do, I won't argue and give utterance to my ideas lightly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought.
<p/>Getting out of the trap and greeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother and Katavasov, Levin asked about his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has taken Mitya to Kolok''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-a copse near the house-RRB-.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) meant to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) out there because it's so hot indoors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.
<p/>Levin had always advised his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife not to take the baby to the wood, thinking it unsafe, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was not pleased to hear this.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) rushes about from place to place with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div>said the prince, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) to try putting him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) in the ice cellar.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) meant to come to the bee house.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) thought you would be there.
<p/>We are going there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and what are you doing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>said Sergey Ivanovitch, falling back from the rest and walking beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing special.
<p/>Busy as usual with the land,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>answered Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and what about you?
<p/>Come for long?
<p/>We have been expecting you for such a long time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only for a fortnight.
<p/>I've a great deal to do in Moscow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the brothers</b></font>)</div><p/>At these words the brothers' eyes met, and Levin, in spite of the desire he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) always had, stronger than ever just now, to be on affectionate and still more open terms with his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, felt an awkwardness in looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes and did not know what to say.
<p/>Casting over the subjects of conversation that would be pleasant to Sergey Ivanovitch, and would keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) off the subject of the Servian war and the Slavonic question, at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had hinted by the allusion to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had to do in Moscow, Levin began to talk of Sergey Ivanovitch's book.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, have there been reviews of your book?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) asked.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch smiled at the intentional character of the question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one is interested in that now, and I less than anyone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just look, Darya Alexandrovna, we shall have a shower,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) added, pointing with a sunshade at the white rain clouds that showed above the aspen tree-tops.
<p/>And these words were enough to re-establish again between the brothers that tone--hardly hostile, but chilly--which Levin had been so longing to avoid.
<p/>Levin went up to Katavasov.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was jolly of you to make up your mind to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been meaning to a long while.
<p/>Now we shall have some discussion, we'll see to that.
<p/>Have you been reading Spencer?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I've not finished reading him (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't need him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How's that?
<p/>that's interesting.
<p/>Why so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that I'm fully convinced that the solution of the problems that interest me I shall never find in him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) like.
<p/>Now...''   (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div>But Katavasov's serene and good-humored expression suddenly struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt such tenderness for his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) own happy mood, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was unmistakably disturbing by this conversation, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) resolution and stopped short.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we'll talk later on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) added.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we're going to the bee house, it's this way, along this little path,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said, addressing them all.
<p/>Going along the narrow path to a little uncut meadow covered on one side with thick clumps of brilliant heart's-ease among which stood up here and there tall, dark green tufts of hellebore, Levin settled his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) guests in the dense, cool shade of the young aspens on a bench and some stumps purposely put there for visitors to the bee house who might be afraid of the bees, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went off himself to the hut to get bread, cucumbers, and fresh honey, to regale them with.
<p/>Trying to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) movements as deliberate as possible, and listening to the bees that buzzed more and more frequently past him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) walked along the little path to the hut.
<p/>In the very entry one bee hummed angrily, caught in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) beard, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) carefully extricated it.
<p/>Going into the shady outer room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took down from the wall his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) veil, that hung on a peg, and putting it on, and thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pockets, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) went into the fenced-in bee-garden, where there stood in the midst of a closely mown space in regular rows, fastened with bast on posts, all the hives he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew so well, the old stocks, each with its own history, and along the fences the younger swarms hived that year.
<p/>In front of the openings of the hives, it made his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) eyes giddy to watch the bees and drones whirling round and round about the same spot, while among them the working bees flew in and out with spoils or in search of them, always in the same direction into the wood to the flowering lime trees and back to the hives.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ears were filled with the incessant hum in various notes, now the busy hum of the working bee flying quickly off, then the blaring of the lazy drone, and the excited buzz of the bees on guard protecting their property from the enemy and preparing to sting.
<p/>On the farther side of the fence the old bee-keeper was shaving a hoop for a tub, and he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) did not see Levin.
<p/>Levin stood still in the midst of the beehives and did not call him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was glad of a chance to be alone to recover from the influence of ordinary actual life, which had already depressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) happy mood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had already had time to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) temper with Ivan, to show coolness to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, and to talk flippantly with Katavasov.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can it have been only a momentary mood, and will it pass and leave no trace?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought.
<p/>But the same instant, going back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) felt with delight that something new and important had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Real life had only for a time overcast the spiritual peace he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had found, but it was still untouched within him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Just as the bees, whirling round him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), now menacing him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) and distracting his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) attention, prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) from enjoying complete physical peace, forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) movements to avoid them, so had the petty cares that had swarmed about him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) from the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) got into the trap restricted his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) spiritual freedom; but that lasted only so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was among them.
<p/>Just as his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) bodily strength was still unaffected, in spite of the bees, so too was the spiritual strength that he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had just become aware of.
<p/>Chapter 15   <div class="bookquote">``Do you know, Kostya, with whom Sergey Ivanovitch traveled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) way here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dolly, doling out cucumbers and honey to the children; <div class="bookquote">``with Vronsky!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>)'s going to Servia.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And not alone; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>)'s taking a squadron out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) own expense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div>said Katavasov.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the right thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are volunteers still going out then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) added, glancing at Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch did not answer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was carefully with a blunt knife getting a live bee covered with sticky honey out of a cup full of white honeycomb.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think so!
<p/>You should have seen what was going on at the station yesterday!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div><p/>said Katavasov, biting with a juicy sound into a cucumber.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what is one to make of it?
<p/>For mercy's sake, do explain to me, Sergey Ivanovitch, where are all those volunteers going, whom are they fighting with?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div><p/>asked the old prince, unmistakably taking up a conversation that had sprung up in Levin's absence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``With the Turks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>Sergey Ivanovitch answered, smiling serenely, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) extricated the bee, dark with honey and helplessly kicking, and put it with the knife on a stout aspen leaf.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But who has declared war on the Turks?--Ivan Ivanovitch Ragozov and Countess Lidia Ivanovna, assisted by Madame Stahl?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one has declared war, but people sympathize with their neighbors' sufferings and are eager to help them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the prince is not speaking of help,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin, coming to the assistance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) father-in-law, <div class="bookquote">``but of war.
<p/>The prince says that private persons cannot take part in war without the permission of the government.''
 (<font color='red'><b>father-in-law</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kostya, mind, that's a bee!
<p/>Really, they'll sting us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dolly, waving away a wasp.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But that's not a bee, it's a wasp,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well now, well, what's your own theory?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div><p/>Katavasov said to Levin with a smile, distinctly challenging him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) to a discussion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why have not private persons the right to do so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my theory's this: war is on one side such a beastly, cruel, and awful thing, that no one man, not to speak of a Christian, can individually take upon himself the responsibility of beginning wars; that can only be done by a government, which is called upon to do this, and is driven inevitably into war.
<p/>On the other hand, both political science and common sense teach us that in matters of state, and especially in the matter of war, private citizens must forego their personal individual will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had their replies ready, and both began speaking at the same time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the point is, my dear fellow, that there may be cases when the government does not carry out the will of the citizens and then the public asserts its will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div>said Katavasov.
<p/>But evidently Sergey Ivanovitch did not approve of this answer.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brows contracted at Katavasov's words and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) said something else.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't put the matter in its true light.
<p/>There is no question here of a declaration of war, but simply the expression of a human Christian feeling.
<p/>Our brothers, one with us in religion and in race, are being massacred.
<p/>Even supposing they were not our brothers nor fellow-Christians, but simply children, women, old people, feeling is aroused and Russians go eagerly to help in stopping these atrocities.
<p/>Fancy, if you were going along the street and saw drunken men beating a woman or a child--I imagine you would not stop to inquire whether war had been declared on the men, but would throw yourself on them, and protect the victim.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I should not kill them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you would kill them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.
<p/>If I saw that, I might give way to my impulse of the moment, but I can't say beforehand.
<p/>And such a momentary impulse there is not, and there cannot be, in the case of the oppression of the Slavonic peoples.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly for you there is not; but for others there is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning with displeasure.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are traditions still extant among the people of Slavs of the true faith suffering under the yoke of the `unclean sons of Hagar.'

<p/>I was very much upset, thought I was a monster, or that it was the influence of Carlsbad on me.
<p/>But since I have been here, my mind's been set at rest.
<p/>I see that there are people besides me who're only interested in Russia, and not in their Slavonic brethren.
<p/>Here's Konstantin too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Personal opinions mean nothing in such a case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch; <div class="bookquote">``it's not a matter of personal opinions when all Russia--the whole people--has expressed its will.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa!...how can you say that?
<p/>And last Sunday in church?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dolly, listening to the conversation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please give me a cloth,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said to the old man, who was looking at the children with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's not possible that all...''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But what was it in church on Sunday?
<p/>The priest had been told to read that.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The people cannot help knowing; the sense of their own destinies is always in the people, and at such moments as the present that sense finds utterance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div>said Sergey Ivanovitch with conviction, glancing at the old bee-keeper.
<p/>The handsome old man, with black grizzled beard and thick silvery hair, stood motionless, holding a cup of honey, looking down from the height of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tall figure with friendly serenity at the gentlefolk, obviously understanding nothing of their conversation and not caring to understand it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's so, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, with a significant shake of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head at Sergey Ivanovitch's words.

<p/>What right have we to say that this is the people's will?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sergey Ivanovitch/Koznishev/Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 16   Sergey Ivanovitch, being practiced in argument, did not reply, but at once turned the conversation to another aspect of the subject.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you want to learn the spirit of the people by arithmetical computation, of course it's very difficult to arrive at it.
<p/>And voting has not been introduced among us and cannot be introduced, for it does not express the will of the people; but there are other ways of reaching that.
<p/>It is felt in the air, it is felt by the heart.
<p/>I won't speak of those deep currents which are astir in the still ocean of the people, and which are evident to every unprejudiced man; let us look at society in the narrow sense.
<p/>All the most diverse sections of the educated public, hostile before, are merged in one.
<p/>Every division is at an end, all the public organs say the same thing over and over again, all feel the mighty torrent that has overtaken them and is carrying them in one direction.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, all the newspapers do say the same thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div>said the prince.

<p/>Levin would have answered, but the old prince interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, about that unanimity, that's another thing, one may say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prince</b></font>)</div>said the prince.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it is with the unanimity of the press.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that it was a joke, that...''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>Levin was beginning, but Sergey Ivanovitch interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Every member of society is called upon to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) own special work,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And men of thought are doing their work when they express public opinion.
<p/>And the single-hearted and full expression of public opinion is the service of the press and a phenomenon to rejoice us at the same time.
<p/>Twenty years ago we should have been silent, but now we have heard the voice of the Russian people, which is ready to rise as one man and ready to sacrifice itself for its oppressed brethren; that is a great step and a proof of strength.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's not only making a sacrifice, but killing Turks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div>said Levin timidly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The people make sacrifices and are ready to make sacrifices for their soul, but not for murder,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) added, instinctively connecting the conversation with the ideas that had been absorbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For their soul?
<p/>That's a most puzzling expression for a natural science man, do you understand?
<p/>What sort of thing is the soul?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you know!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, by God, I haven't the faintest idea!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div><p/>said Katavasov with a loud roar of laughter.
<p/>'''I bring not peace, but a sword,' says Christ,'' Sergey Ivanovitch rejoined for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) part, quoting as simply as though it were the easiest thing to understand the very passage that had always puzzled Levin most.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's so, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the old man repeated again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was standing near them and responded to a chance glance turned in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) direction.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear fellow, you're defeated, utterly defeated!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Katavasov</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Katavasov good-humoredly.
<p/>Levin reddened with vexation, not at being defeated, but at having failed to control himself and being drawn into argument.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I can't argue with them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``they wear impenetrable armor, while I'm naked.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw that it was impossible to convince his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother and Katavasov, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw even less possibility of himself agreeing with them.
<p/>What they advocated was the very pride of intellect that had almost been his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) ruin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not admit that some dozens of men, among them his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) brother, had the right, on the ground of what they were told by some hundreds of glib volunteers swarming to the capital, to say that they and the newspapers were expressing the will and feeling of the people, and a feeling which was expressed in vengeance and murder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not admit this, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) neither saw the expression of such feelings in the people among whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was living, nor found them in himself -LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) could not but consider himself one of the persons making up the Russian people-RRB-, and most of all because he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>), like the people, did not know and could not know what is for the general good, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew beyond a doubt that this general good could be attained only by the strict observance of that law of right and wrong which has been revealed to every man, and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not wish for war or advocate war for any general objects whatever.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said as Mihalitch did and the people, who had expressed their feeling in the traditional invitations of the Varyagi: <div class="bookquote">``Be princes and rule over us.
<p/>Gladly we promise complete submission.
<p/>All the labor, all humiliations, all sacrifices we take upon ourselves; but we will not judge and decide.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the people princes rule</b></font>)</div><p/>And now, according to Sergey Ivanovitch's account, the people had foregone this privilege they had bought at such a costly price.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) wanted to say too that if public opinion were an infallible guide, then why were not revolutions and the commune as lawful as the movement in favor of the Slavonic peoples?
<p/>But these were merely thoughts that could settle nothing.
<p/>One thing could be seen beyond doubt--that was that at the actual moment the discussion was irritating Sergey Ivanovitch, and so it was wrong to continue it.
<p/>And Levin ceased speaking and then called the attention of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) guests to the fact that the storm clouds were gathering, and that they had better be going home before it rained.
<p/>Chapter 17   The old prince and Sergey Ivanovitch got into the trap and drove off; the rest of the party hastened homewards on foot.
<p/>But the storm-clouds, turning white and then black, moved down so quickly that they had to quicken their pace to get home before the rain.
<p/>The foremost clouds, lowering and black as soot-laden smoke, rushed with extraordinary swiftness over the sky.
<p/>They were still two hundred paces from home and a gust of wind had already blown up, and every second the downpour might be looked for.
<p/>The children ran ahead with frightened and gleeful shrieks.
<p/>Darya Alexandrovna, struggling painfully with her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) skirts that clung round her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) legs, was not walking, but running, her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) eyes fixed on the children.
<p/>The men of the party, holding their hats on, strode with long steps beside her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>).
<p/>They were just at the steps when a big drop fell splashing on the edge of the iron guttering.
<p/>The children and their elders after them ran into the shelter of the house, talking merrily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Katerina Alexandrovna?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin asked of Agafea Mihalovna, who met them with kerchiefs and rugs in the hall.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) was with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mitya?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the copse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) must be, and the nurse with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin snatched up the rugs and ran towards the copse.
<p/>In that brief interval of time the storm clouds had moved on, covering the sun so completely that it was dark as an eclipse.
<p/>Stubbornly, as though insisting on its rights, the wind stopped Levin, and tearing the leaves and flowers off the lime trees and stripping the white birch branches into strange unseemly nakedness, it twisted everything on one side--acacias, flowers, burdocks, long grass, and tall tree-tops.
<p/>The peasant girls working in the garden ran shrieking into shelter in the servants' quarters.
<p/>The streaming rain had already flung its white veil over all the distant forest and half the fields close by, and was rapidly swooping down upon the copse.
<p/>The wet of the rain spurting up in tiny drops could be smelt in the air.
<p/>Holding his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) head bent down before him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>), and struggling with the wind that strove to tear the wraps away from him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>), Levin was moving up to the copse and had just caught sight of something white behind the oak tree, when there was a sudden flash, the whole earth seemed on fire, and the vault of heaven seemed crashing overhead.
<p/>Opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) blinded eyes, Levin gazed through the thick veil of rain that separated him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) now from the copse, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) horror the first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) saw was the green crest of the familiar oak-tree in the middle of the copse uncannily changing its position.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can it have been struck?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin hardly had time to think when, moving more and more rapidly, the oak tree vanished behind the other trees, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard the crash of the great tree falling upon the others.
<p/>The flash of lightning, the crash of thunder, and the instantaneous chill that ran through him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) were all merged for Levin in one sense of terror.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My God!
<p/>my God!
<p/>not on them!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said.
<p/>And though he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought at once how senseless was his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) prayer that they should not have been killed by the oak which had fallen now, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) repeated it, knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could do nothing better than utter this senseless prayer.
<p/>Running up to the place where they usually went, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not find them there.
<p/>They were at the other end of the copse under an old lime-tree; they were calling him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>Two figures in dark dresses -LRB-they had been light summer dresses when they started out-RRB- were standing bending over something.
<p/>It was Kitty with the nurse.
<p/>The rain was already ceasing, and it was beginning to get light when Levin reached them.
<p/>The nurse was not wet on the lower part of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) dress, but Kitty was drenched through, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) soaked clothes clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/>Though the rain was over, they still stood in the same position in which they had been standing when the storm broke.
<p/>Both stood bending over a perambulator with a green umbrella.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alive?
<p/>Unhurt?
<p/>Thank God!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, splashing with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soaked boots through the standing water and running up to them.
<p/>Kitty's rosy wet face was turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) smiled timidly under her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) shapeless sopped hat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
<p/>I can't think how you can be so reckless!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said angrily to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wasn't my fault, really.
<p/>We were just meaning to go, when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made such a to-do that we had to change him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>We were just...''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>Kitty began defending herself.
<p/>Mitya was unharmed, dry, and still fast asleep.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, thank God!
<p/>I don't know what I'm saying!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the baby</b></font>)</div><p/>They gathered up the baby's wet belongings; the nurse picked up the baby and carried it.
<p/>Levin walked beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) wife, and, penitent for having been angry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) squeezed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand when the nurse was not looking.
<p/>Chapter 18   During the whole of that day, in the extremely different conversations in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) took part, only as it were with the top layer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mind, in spite of the disappointment of not finding the change he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) expected in himself, Levin had been all the while joyfully conscious of the fulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heart.
<p/>After the rain it was too wet to go for a walk; besides, the storm clouds still hung about the horizon, and gathered here and there, black and thundery, on the rim of the sky.
<p/>The whole party spent the rest of the day in the house.
<p/>No more discussions sprang up; on the contrary, after dinner every one was in the most amiable frame of mind.
<p/>At first Katavasov amused the ladies by his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) original jokes, which always pleased people on their first acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>).
<p/>Then Sergey Ivanovitch induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) to tell them about the very interesting observations he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had made on the habits and characteristics of common houseflies, and their life.
<p/>Sergey Ivanovitch, too, was in good spirits, and at tea his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) brother drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) on to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) views of the future of the Eastern question, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) spoke so simply and so well, that everyone listened eagerly.
<p/>Kitty was the only one who did not hear it all--she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was summoned to give Mitya his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) bath.
<p/>A few minutes after Kitty had left the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sent for Levin to come to the nursery.
<p/>Leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) tea, and regretfully interrupting the interesting conversation, and at the same time uneasily wondering why he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been sent for, as this only happened on important occasions, Levin went to the nursery.
<p/>Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had been much interested by Sergey Ivanovitch's views of the new epoch in history that would be created by the emancipation of forty millions of men of Slavonic race acting with Russia, a conception quite new to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), and although he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) was disturbed by uneasy wonder at being sent for by Kitty, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) came out of the drawing room and was alone, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) mind reverted at once to the thoughts of the morning.
<p/>And all the theories of the significance of the Slav element in the history of the world seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) so trivial compared with what was passing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) own soul, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) instantly forgot it all and dropped back into the same frame of mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) had been in that morning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) did not, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) had done at other times, recall the whole train of thought--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) did not need.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) fell back at once into the feeling which had guided him (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>), which was connected with those thoughts, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) found that feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) soul even stronger and more definite than before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) did not, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) had had to do with previous attempts to find comforting arguments, need to revive a whole chain of thought to find the feeling.
<p/>Now, on the contrary, the feeling of joy and peace was keener than ever, and thought could not keep pace with feeling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) walked across the terrace and looked at two stars that had come out in the darkening sky, and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) remembered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, looking at the sky, I thought that the dome that I see is not a deception, and then I thought something, I shirked facing something,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) mused.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But whatever it was, there can be no disproving it!
<p/>I have but to think, and all will come clear!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) was going into the nursery he (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) remembered what it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) had shirked facing.
<p/>It was that if the chief proof of the Divinity was His (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) revelation of what is right, how is it this revelation is confined to the Christian church alone?
<p/>What relation to this revelation have the beliefs of the Buddhists, Mohammedans, who preached and did good too?
<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) had an answer to this question; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) had not time to formulate it to himself before he (<font color='blue'><b>Slav</b></font>) went into the nursery.
<p/>Kitty was standing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sleeves tucked up over the baby in the bath.
<p/>Hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband's footstep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), summoning him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) smile.
<p/>With one hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was supporting the fat baby that lay floating and sprawling on its back, while with the other she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) squeezed the sponge over him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, look, look!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Agafea Mihalovna's right.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knows us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mitya</b></font>)</div><p/>Mitya had on that day given unmistakable, incontestable signs of recognizing all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) friends.
<p/>As soon as Levin approached the bath, the experiment was tried, and it was completely successful.
<p/>The cook, sent for with this object, bent over the baby.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) frowned and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) head disapprovingly.
<p/>Kitty bent down to him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) a beaming smile, propped his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) little hands on the sponge and chirruped, making such a queer little contented sound with his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) lips, that Kitty and the nurse were not alone in their admiration.
<p/>Levin, too, was surprised and delighted.
<p/>The baby was taken out of the bath, drenched with water, wrapped in towels, dried, and after a piercing scream, handed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) mother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am glad you are beginning to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Shtcherbatskaya/Kitty Shtcherbatskaya</b></font>)</div>said Kitty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) husband, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had settled herself comfortably in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) usual place, with the baby at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) breast.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad!
<p/>It had begun to distress me.
<p/>You said you had no feeling for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; did I say that?
<p/>I only said I was disappointed.''

(<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) listened attentively, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) over the baby, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) put back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) slender fingers the rings she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had taken off while giving Mitya his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bath.

 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 19   Going out of the nursery and being again alone, Levin went back at once to the thought, in which there was something not clear.
<p/>Instead of going into the drawing room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) heard voices, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) stopped on the terrace, and leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) elbows on the parapet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) gazed up at the sky.
<p/>It was quite dark now, and in the south, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) was looking, there were no clouds.
<p/>The storm had drifted on to the opposite side of the sky, and there were flashes of lightning and distant thunder from that quarter.
<p/>Levin listened to the monotonous drip from the lime trees in the garden, and looked at the triangle of stars he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) knew so well, and the Milky Way with its branches that ran through its midst.
<p/>At each flash of lightning the Milky Way, and even the bright stars, vanished, but as soon as the lightning died away, they reappeared in their places as though some hand had flung them back with careful aim.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what is it perplexes me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levin/Nikolay/Nikolay Levin</b></font>)</div><p/>Levin said to himself, feeling beforehand that the solution of his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) difficulties was ready in his (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) soul, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) did not know it yet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the one unmistakable, incontestable manifestation of the Divinity is the law of right and wrong, which has come into the world by revelation, and which I feel in myself, and in the recognition of which--I don't make myself, but whether I will or not--I am made one with other men in one body of believers, which is called the church.
<p/>Well, but the Jews, the Mohammedans, the Confucians, the Buddhists--what of them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) put to himself the question he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) had feared to face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can these hundreds of millions of men be deprived of that highest blessing without which life has no meaning?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) pondered a moment, but immediately corrected himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what am I questioning?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) said to himself.
<p/>``I am questioning the relation to Divinity of all the different religions of all mankind.
<p/>I am questioning the universal manifestation of God to all the world with all those misty blurs.
<p/>What am I about?
<p/>To me individually, to my heart has been revealed a knowledge beyond all doubt, and unattainable by reason, and here I am obstinately trying to express that knowledge in reason and words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't I know that the stars don't move?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) asked himself, gazing at the bright planet which had shifted its position up to the topmost twig of the birch-tree.
<p/>``But looking at the movements of the stars, I can't picture to myself the rotation of the earth, and I'm right in saying that the stars move.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And could the astronomers have understood and calculated anything, if they had taken into account all the complicated and varied motions of the earth?
<p/>All the marvelous conclusions they have reached about the distances, weights, movements, and deflections of the heavenly bodies are only founded on the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies about a stationary earth, on that very motion I see before me now, which has been so for millions of men during long ages, and was and will be always alike, and can always be trusted.
<p/>And just as the conclusions of the astronomers would have been vain and uncertain if not founded on observations of the seen heavens, in relation to a single meridian and a single horizon, so would my conclusions be vain and uncertain if not founded on that conception of right, which has been and will be always alike for all men, which has been revealed to me as a Christian, and which can always be trusted in my soul.
<p/>The question of other religions and their relations to Divinity I have no right to decide, and no possibility of deciding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) heard Kitty's voice all at once, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) came by the same way to the drawing-room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?
<p/>you're not worried about anything?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) said, looking intently at his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) face in the starlight.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) could not have seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) face if a flash of lightning had not hidden the stars and revealed it.
<p/>In that flash she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) face distinctly, and seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) calm and happy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) understands,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) knows what I'm thinking about.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But at the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was about to speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) began speaking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kostya!

<p/>``It is a secret for me alone, of vital importance for me, and not to be put into words.
<p/>``This new feeling has not changed me, has not made me happy and enlightened all of a sudden, as I had dreamed, just like the feeling for my child.
<p/>There was no surprise in this either.
<p/>Faith--or not faith--I don't know what it is--but this feeling has come just as imperceptibly through suffering, and has taken firm root in my soul.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall go on in the same way, losing my temper with Ivan the coachman, falling into angry discussions, expressing my opinions tactlessly; there will be still the same wall between the holy of holies of my soul and other people, even my wife; I shall still go on scolding her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for my own terror, and being remorseful for it; I shall still be as unable to understand with my reason why I pray, and I shall still go on praying; but my life now, my whole life apart from anything that can happen to me, every minute of it is no more meaningless, as it was before, but it has the positive meaning of goodness, which I have the power to put into it.''
