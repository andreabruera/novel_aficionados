Humph ! in my poor , insignificant opinion , I regard this as queer . I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings ; your doubloons of old Spain , your doubloons of Peru , your doubloons of Chili , your doubloons of Bolivia , your doubloons of Popayan ; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles , and joes , and half joes , and quarter joes . What then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful ? By Golconda ! let me read it once . Halloa ! here 's signs and wonders truly ! That , now , is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac , and what my almanac below calls ditto . I 'll get the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll 's arithmetic , I 'll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar . Here 's the book . Let 's see now . Signs and wonders ; and the sun , he 's always among 'em . Hem , hem , hem ; here they are -- here they go -- all alive : -- Aries , or the Ram ; Taurus , or the Bull and Jimimi ! here 's Gemini himself , or the Twins . Well ; the sun he wheels among 'em . Aye , here on the coin he 's just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring . Book ! you lie there ; the fact is , you books must know your places . You 'll do to give us the bare words and facts , but we come in to supply the thoughts . That 's my small experience , so far as the Massachusetts calendar , and Bowditch 's navigator , and Daboll 's arithmetic go . Signs and wonders , eh ? Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs , and significant in wonders ! There 's a clue somewhere ; wait a bit ; hist -- hark ! By Jove , I have it ! Look you , Doubloon , your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter ; and now I 'll read it off , straight out of the book . Come , Almanack ! To begin : there 's Aries , or the Ram -- lecherous dog , he begets us ; then , Taurus , or the Bull -- he bumps us the first thing ; then Gemini , or the Twins -- that is , Virtue and Vice ; we try to reach Virtue , when lo ! comes Cancer the Crab , and drags us back ; and here , going from Virtue , Leo , a roaring Lion , lies in the path -- he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw ; we escape , and hail Virgo , the Virgin ! that 's our first love ; we marry and think to be happy for aye , when pop comes Libra , or the Scales -- happiness weighed and found wanting ; and while we are very sad about that , Lord ! how we suddenly jump , as Scorpio , or the Scorpion , stings us in the rear ; we are curing the wound , when whang come the arrows all round ; Sagittarius , or the Archer , is amusing himself . As we pluck out the shafts , stand aside ! here 's the battering-ram , Capricornus , or the Goat ; full tilt , he comes rushing , and headlong we are tossed ; when Aquarius , or the Water-bearer , pours out his whole deluge and drowns us ; and to wind up with Pisces , or the Fishes , we sleep . There 's a sermon now , writ in high heaven , and the sun goes through it every year , and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty . Jollily he , aloft there , wheels through toil and trouble ; and so , alow here , does jolly Stubb . Oh , jolly 's the word for aye ! Adieu , Doubloon ! But stop ; here comes little King-Post ; dodge round the try-works , now , and let 's hear what he 'll have to say . There ; he 's before it ; he 'll out with something presently .
