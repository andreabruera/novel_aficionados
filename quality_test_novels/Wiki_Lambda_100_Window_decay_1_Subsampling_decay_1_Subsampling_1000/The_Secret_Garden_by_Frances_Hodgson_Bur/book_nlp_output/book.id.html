 (<font color='red'><b>Frances Hodgson Burnett/FRANCES HODGSON/FRANCES HODGSON BURNETT</b></font>)</div><p/>XXVII  IN THE GARDEN      THE SECRET GARDEN  BY FRANCES HODGSON BURNETT     CHAPTER I  THERE IS NO ONE LEFT   When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) uncle everybody said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen.
<p/>It was true, too.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour expression.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) hair was yellow, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) face was yellow because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) father had held a position under the English Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) over to the care of an Ayah, who was made to understand that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wished to please the Mem Sahib she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must keep the child out of sight as much as possible.
<p/>So when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a sickly, fretful, ugly little baby she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was kept out of the way, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) became a sickly, fretful, toddling thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was kept out of the way also.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was disturbed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) crying, by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was six years old she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived.
<p/>The young English governess who came to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to read and write disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) place in three months, and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a shorter time than the first one.
<p/>So if Mary had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would never have learned her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) letters at all.
<p/>One frightfully hot morning, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was about nine years old, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) awakened feeling very cross, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) became crosser still when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw that the servant who stood by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bedside was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Ayah.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to the strange woman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not let you stay.
<p/>Send my Ayah to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman looked frightened, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only stammered that the Ayah could not come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib.
<p/>There was something mysterious in the air that morning.
<p/>Nothing was done in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing, while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces.
<p/>But no one would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) anything and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Ayah did not come.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was actually left alone as the morning went on, and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pretended that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was making a flower-bed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth, all the time growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would say and the names she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would call Saidie when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) returned.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pig!
<p/>Pig!
<p/>Daughter of Pigs!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, because to call a native a pig is the worst insult of all.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was grinding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) teeth and saying this over and over again when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother come out on the veranda with some one.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices.
<p/>Mary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a very young officer who had just come from England.
<p/>The child stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stared most at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) always did this when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a chance to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), because the Mem Sahib--Mary used to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that oftener than anything else--was such a tall, slim, pretty person and wore such lovely clothes.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hair was like curly silk and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had large laughing eyes.
<p/>All her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) clothes were thin and floating, and Mary said they were <div class="bookquote">``full of lace.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>They looked fuller of lace than ever this morning, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes were not laughing at all.
<p/>They were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officer's face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it so very bad?
<p/>Oh, is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) say.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Awfully,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man answered in a trembling voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Awfully, Mrs. Lennox.
<p/>You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mem Sahib</b></font>)</div><p/>The Mem Sahib wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) hands.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know I ought!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) cried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only stayed to go to that silly dinner party.
<p/>What a fool I was!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the servants</b></font>)</div><p/>At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the servants' quarters that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) clutched the young man's arm, and Mary stood shivering from head to foot.
<p/>The wailing grew wilder and wilder.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?
<p/>What is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Lennox gasped.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some one has died,''  (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div>answered the boy officer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not say it had broken out among your servants.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mem Sahib</b></font>)</div><p/>the Mem Sahib cried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come with me!
<p/>Come with me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) turned and ran into the house.
<p/>After that, appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness of the morning was explained to Mary.
<p/>The cholera had broken out in its most fatal form and people were dying like flies.
<p/>The Ayah had been taken ill in the night, and it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had just died that the servants had wailed in the huts.
<p/>Before the next day three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror.
<p/>There was panic on every side, and dying people in all the bungalows.
<p/>During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone.
<p/>Nobody thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), nobody wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and strange things happened of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew nothing.
<p/>Mary alternately cried and slept through the hours.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) only knew that people were ill and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard mysterious and frightening sounds.
<p/>Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) crept into the dining-room and found it empty, though a partly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for some reason.
<p/>The child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirsty she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled.
<p/>It was sweet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know how strong it was.
<p/>Very soon it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) intensely drowsy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) nursery and shut herself in again, frightened by cries she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet.
<p/>The wine made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) so sleepy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could scarcely keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes open and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lay down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bed and knew nothing more for a long time.
<p/>Many things happened during the hours in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) slept so heavily, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carried in and out of the bungalow.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) awakened she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lay and stared at the wall.
<p/>The house was perfectly still.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never known it to be so silent before.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard neither voices nor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got well of the cholera and all the trouble was over.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wondered also who would take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) now her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Ayah was dead.
<p/>There would be a new Ayah, and perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would know some new stories.
<p/>Mary had been rather tired of the old ones.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not cry because her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) nurse had died.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not an affectionate child and had never cared much for any one.
<p/>The noise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was alive.
<p/>Everyone was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no one was fond of.
<p/>When people had the cholera it seemed that they remembered nothing but themselves.
<p/>But if everyone had got well again, surely some one would remember and come to look for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>But no one came, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more silent.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heard something rustling on the matting and when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked down she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw a little snake gliding along and watching her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with eyes like jewels.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not frightened, because he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a harmless little thing who would not hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed in a hurry to get out of the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) slipped under the door as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How queer and quiet it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It sounds as if there were no one in the bungalow but me and the snake.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Almost the next minute she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heard footsteps in the compound, and then on the veranda.
<p/>They were men's footsteps, and the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices.
<p/>No one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to open doors and look into rooms.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What desolation!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heard one voice say.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That pretty, pretty woman!
<p/>I suppose the child, too.
<p/>I heard there was a child, though no one ever saw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door a few minutes later.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked an ugly, cross little thing and was frowning because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected.
<p/>The first man who came in was a large officer she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had once seen talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked tired and troubled, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was so startled that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) almost jumped back.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Barney!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) cried out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a child here!
<p/>A child alone!
<p/>In a place like this!
<p/>Mercy on us, who is she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am Mary Lennox,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the little girl said, drawing herself up stiffly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) thought the man was very rude to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) father's bungalow <div class="bookquote">``A place like this!''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fell asleep when everyone had the cholera and I have only just wakened up.
<p/>Why does nobody come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the child no one ever saw!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>exclaimed the man, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companions.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) has actually been forgotten!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why was I forgotten?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary said, stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) foot.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why does nobody come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man whose name was Barney looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) very sadly.
<p/>Mary even thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) wink his (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) eyes as if to wink tears away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor little kid!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nobody left to come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had neither father nor mother left; that they had died and been carried away in the night, and that the few native servants who had not died also had left the house as quickly as they could get out of it, none of them even remembering that there was a Missie Sahib.
<p/>That was why the place was so quiet.
<p/>It was true that there was no one in the bungalow but herself and the little rustling snake.
<p/>CHAPTER II  MISTRESS MARY QUITE CONTRARY   Mary had liked to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother from a distance and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) very pretty, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew very little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could scarcely have been expected to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) or to miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) very much when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was gone.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) at all, in fact, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a self-absorbed child she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) entire thought to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had always done.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been older she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would no doubt have been very anxious at being left alone in the world, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was very young, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had always been taken care of, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) always would be.
<p/>What she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would like to know if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was going to nice people, who would be polite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own way as her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Ayah and the other native servants had done.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not going to stay at the English clergyman's house where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was taken at first.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not want to stay.
<p/>The English clergyman was poor and he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had five children nearly all the same age and they wore shabby clothes and were always quarreling and snatching toys from each other.
<p/>Mary hated their untidy bungalow and was so disagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody would play with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>By the second day they had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a nickname which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) furious.
<p/>It was Basil who thought of it first.
<p/>Basil was a little boy with impudent blue eyes and a turned-up nose, and Mary hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was playing by herself under a tree, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been playing the day the cholera broke out.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was making heaps of earth and paths for a garden and Basil came and stood near to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) got rather interested and suddenly made a suggestion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There in the middle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) leaned over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to point.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want boys.
<p/>Go away!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Basil</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment Basil looked angry, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) began to tease.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) was always teasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) sisters.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) danced round and round her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and made faces and sang and laughed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mistress Mary, quite contrary, How does your garden grow?

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) sang it until the other children heard and laughed, too; and the crosser Mary got, the more they sang <div class="bookquote">``Mistress Mary, quite contrary'' (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>; and after that as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stayed with them they called her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Mistress Mary Quite Contrary''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>when they spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to each other, and often when they spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know anything.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s so cross he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) won't let them, and they wouldn't come if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would let them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s a hunchback, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s horrid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) back and stuck her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fingers in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ears, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not listen any more.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought over it a great deal afterward; and when Mrs. Crawford told her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) that night that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was going to sail away to England in a few days and go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, who lived at Misselthwaite Manor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) looked so stony and stubbornly uninterested that they did not know what to think about her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>).
<p/>They tried to be kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) only turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) face away when Mrs. Crawford attempted to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and held herself stiffly when Mr. Crawford patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is such a plain child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Crawford said pityingly, afterward.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mother was such a pretty creature.

<p/>It is very sad, now the poor beautiful thing is gone, to remember that many people never even knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a child at all.''

<p/>Colonel McGrew said he (<font color='blue'><b>McGrew</b></font>) nearly jumped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>McGrew</b></font>) skin when he (<font color='blue'><b>McGrew</b></font>) opened the door and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) standing by herself in the middle of the room.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary made the long voyage to England under the care of an officer's wife, who was taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) children to leave them in a boarding-school.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was very much absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own little boy and girl, and was rather glad to hand the child over to the woman Mr. Archibald Craven sent to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), in London.
<p/>The woman was his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor, and her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) name was Mrs. Medlock.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was a stout woman, with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) wore a very purple dress, a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black bonnet with purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) head.
<p/>Mary did not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) at all, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) very seldom liked people there was nothing remarkable in that; besides which it was very evident Mrs. Medlock did not think much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My word!
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>)'s a plain little piece of goods!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And we'd heard that her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) mother was a beauty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, there's nothing likely to improve children at Misselthwaite--if you ask me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>They thought Mary was not listening because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was standing a little apart from them at the window of the private hotel they had gone to.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was watching the passing buses and cabs and people, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard quite well and was made very curious about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) uncle and the place he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) lived in.
<p/>What sort of a place was it, and what would he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) be like?
<p/>What was a hunchback?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never seen one.
<p/>Perhaps there were none in India.
<p/>Since she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been living in other people's houses and had had no Ayah, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had begun to wonder why she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never seemed to belong to anyone even when her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father and mother had been alive.
<p/>Other children seemed to belong to their fathers and mothers, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never seemed to really be anyone's little girl.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had had servants, and food and clothes, but no one had taken any notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know that this was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a disagreeable child; but then, of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was disagreeable.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) often thought that other people were, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was so herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought Mrs. Medlock the most disagreeable person she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had ever seen, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) common, highly colored face and her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) common fine bonnet.
<p/>When the next day they set out on their journey to Yorkshire, she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) walked through the station to the railway carriage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) head up and trying to keep as far away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) could, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) did not want to seem to belong to her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>).
<p/>It would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) angry to think people imagined she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) little girl.
<p/>But Mrs. Medlock was not in the least disturbed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) thoughts.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was the kind of woman who would <div class="bookquote">``stand no nonsense from young ones.''
 (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div><p/>At least, that is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) would have said if she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had been asked.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had not wanted to go to London just when her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) sister Maria's daughter was going to be married, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had a comfortable, well paid place as housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor and the only way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) could keep it was to do at once what Mr. Archibald Craven told her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) to do.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) never dared even to ask a question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Lennox and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wife died of the cholera,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Craven/Mr. Archibald Craven/Archibald Craven</b></font>)</div>Mr. Craven had said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) short, cold way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Lennox was my wife's brother and I am their daughter's guardian.
<p/>The child is to be brought here.
<p/>You must go to London and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) packed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) small trunk and made the journey.
<p/>Mary sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) corner of the railway carriage and looked plain and fretful.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had nothing to read or to look at, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had folded her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thin little black-gloved hands in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lap.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) black dress made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) look yellower than ever, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) limp light hair straggled from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) black crepe hat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A more marred-looking young one I never saw in my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Medlock thought.
<p/>-LRB-Marred is a Yorkshire word and means spoiled and pettish.-RRB-
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had never seen a child who sat so still without doing anything; and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) got tired of watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) and began to talk in a brisk, hard voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I may as well tell you something about where you are going to,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know anything about your uncle?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never heard your father and mother talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary frowning.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) frowned because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) remembered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father and mother had never talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) about anything in particular.
<p/>Certainly they had never told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) things.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>muttered Mrs. Medlock, staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) queer, unresponsive little face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) did not say any more for a few moments and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) began again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you might as well be told something--to prepare you.
<p/>You are going to a queer place.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary said nothing at all, and Mrs. Medlock looked rather discomfited by her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) apparent indifference, but, after taking a breath, she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) went on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not but that it's a grand big place in a gloomy way, and Mr. Craven's proud of it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) way--and that's gloomy enough, too.
<p/>The house is six hundred years old and it's on the edge of the moor, and there's near a hundred rooms in it, though most of them's shut up and locked.
<p/>And there's pictures and fine old furniture and things that's been there for ages, and there's a big park round it and gardens and trees with branches trailing to the ground--some of them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) paused and took another breath.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But there's nothing else,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) ended suddenly.
<p/>Mary had begun to listen in spite of herself.
<p/>It all sounded so unlike India, and anything new rather attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not intend to look as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were interested.
<p/>That was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) unhappy, disagreeable ways.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sat still.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Medlock.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing about such places.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div><p/>That made Mrs. Medlock laugh a short sort of laugh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but you are like an old woman.
<p/>Don't you care?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``whether I care or not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right enough there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Medlock.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) never troubles himself about no one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) stopped herself as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had just remembered something in time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s got a crooked back,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary's eyes turned toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) intention not to seem to care.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never thought of the hunchback's being married and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a trifle surprised.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock saw this, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was a talkative woman she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) continued with more interest.
<p/>This was one way of passing some of the time, at any rate.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was a sweet, pretty thing and he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'d have walked the world over to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) a blade o' grass she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) wanted.
<p/>Nobody thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>)'d marry him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) did, and people said she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) married him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) money.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) didn't--she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) didn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>positively.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) died--''   (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary gave a little involuntary jump.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) exclaimed, quite without meaning to.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had just remembered a French fairy story she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had once read called <div class="bookquote">``Riquet a la Houppe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It had been about a poor hunchback and a beautiful princess and it had made her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) suddenly sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) died,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Medlock answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) queerer than ever.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) cares about nobody.

<p/>Most of the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) goes away, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) is at Misselthwaite he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) shuts himself up in the West Wing and won't let any one but Pitcher see him (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>).
<p/>Pitcher's an old fellow, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) took care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) was a child and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) knows his (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) ways.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>It sounded like something in a book and it did not make Mary feel cheerful.
<p/>A house with a hundred rooms, nearly all shut up and with their doors locked--a house on the edge of a moor--whatsoever a moor was--sounded dreary.
<p/>A man with a crooked back who shut himself up also!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stared out of the window with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lips pinched together, and it seemed quite natural that the rain should have begun to pour down in gray slanting lines and splash and stream down the window-panes.
<p/>If the pretty wife had been alive she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might have made things cheerful by being something like her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own mother and by running in and out and going to parties as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had done in frocks <div class="bookquote">``full of lace.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not there any more.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't expect to see him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>), because ten to one you won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Medlock.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not want to go poking about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said sour little Mary and just as suddenly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had begun to be rather sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to cease to be sorry and to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was unpleasant enough to deserve all that had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face toward the streaming panes of the window of the railway carriage and gazed out at the gray rain-storm which looked as if it would go on forever and ever.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) watched it so long and steadily that the grayness grew heavier and heavier before her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fell asleep.
<p/>CHAPTER III  ACROSS THE MOOR   She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) slept a long time, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) awakened Mrs. Medlock had bought a lunchbasket at one of the stations and they had some chicken and cold beef and bread and butter and some hot tea.
<p/>The rain seemed to be streaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in the station wore wet and glistening waterproofs.
<p/>The guard lighted the lamps in the carriage, and Mrs. Medlock cheered up very much over her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) tea and chicken and beef.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep herself, and Mary sat and stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fine bonnet slip on one side until she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) herself fell asleep once more in the corner of the carriage, lulled by the splashing of the rain against the windows.
<p/>It was quite dark when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) awakened again.
<p/>The train had stopped at a station and Mrs. Medlock was shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have had a sleep!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary stood up and tried to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes open while Mrs. Medlock collected her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) parcels.
<p/>The little girl did not offer to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>), because in India native servants always picked up or carried things and it seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one.
<p/>The station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to be getting out of the train.
<p/>The station-master spoke to Mrs. Medlock in a rough, good-natured way, pronouncing his (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) words in a queer broad fashion which Mary found out afterward was Yorkshire.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see tha's got back,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' tha's browt th' young `un with thee.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, that's her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. Medlock, speaking with a Yorkshire accent herself and jerking her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) head over her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) shoulder toward Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How's thy Missus?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well enow.
<p/>Th' carriage is waitin' outside for thee.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A brougham stood on the road before the little outside platform.
<p/>Mary saw that it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman who helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) hat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was, the burly station-master included.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) shut the door, mounted the box with the coachman, and they drove off, the little girl found herself seated in a comfortably cushioned corner, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not inclined to go to sleep again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat and looked out of the window, curious to see something of the road over which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was being driven to the queer place Mrs. Medlock had spoken of.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was not at all a timid child and she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was not exactly frightened, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) felt that there was no knowing what might happen in a house with a hundred rooms nearly all shut up--a house standing on the edge of a moor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is a moor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said suddenly to Mrs. Medlock.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look out of the window in about ten minutes and you'll see,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've got to drive five miles across Missel Moor before we get to the Manor.
<p/>You won't see much because it's a dark night, but you can see something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary asked no more questions but waited in the darkness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) corner, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes on the window.
<p/>The carriage lamps cast rays of light a little distance ahead of them and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) caught glimpses of the things they passed.
<p/>After they had left the station they had driven through a tiny village and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had seen whitewashed cottages and the lights of a public house.
<p/>Then they had passed a church and a vicarage and a little shop-window or so in a cottage with toys and sweets and odd things set out for sale.
<p/>Then they were on the highroad and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw hedges and trees.
<p/>After that there seemed nothing different for a long time--or at least it seemed a long time to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>At last the horses began to go more slowly, as if they were climbing up-hill, and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more trees.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could see nothing, in fact, but a dense darkness on either side.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) leaned forward and pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face against the window just as the carriage gave a big jolt.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>We're on the moor now sure enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Medlock.
<p/>The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road which seemed to be cut through bushes and low-growing things which ended in the great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them.
<p/>A wind was rising and making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's--it's not the sea, is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary, looking round at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) companion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. Medlock.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor it isn't fields nor mountains, it's just miles and miles and miles of wild land that nothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom, and nothing lives on but wild ponies and sheep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel as if it might be the sea, if there were water on it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It sounds like the sea just now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the wind blowing through the bushes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Medlock said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a wild, dreary enough place to my mind, though there's plenty that likes it--particularly when the heather's in bloom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>On and on they drove through the darkness, and though the rain stopped, the wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds.
<p/>The road went up and down, and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge beneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise.
<p/>Mary felt as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide, bleak moor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was passing on a strip of dry land.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pinched her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thin lips more tightly together.
<p/>The horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) first caught sight of a light.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock saw it as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) did and drew a long sigh of relief.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, I am glad to see that bit o' light twinkling,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) exclaimed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the light in the lodge window.
<p/>We shall get a good cup of tea after a bit, at all events.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was <div class="bookquote">``after a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said, for when the carriage passed through the park gates there was still two miles of avenue to drive through and the trees -LRB-which nearly met overhead-RRB- made it seem as if they were driving through a long dark vault.
<p/>They drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before an immensely long but low-built house which seemed to ramble round a stone court.
<p/>At first Mary thought that there were no lights at all in the windows, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) got out of the carriage she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw that one room in a corner upstairs showed a dull glow.
<p/>The entrance door was a huge one made of massive, curiously shaped panels of oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great iron bars.
<p/>It opened into an enormous hall, which was so dimly lighted that the faces in the portraits on the walls and the figures in the suits of armor made Mary feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not want to look at them.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stood on the stone floor she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked a very small, odd little black figure, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt as small and lost and odd as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked.
<p/>A neat, thin old man stood near the manservant who opened the door for them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) room,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said in a husky voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s going to London in the morning.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, Mr. Pitcher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Medlock answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So long as I know what's expected of me, I can manage.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's expected of you, Mrs. Medlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pitcher</b></font>)</div>Mr. Pitcher said, <div class="bookquote">``is that you make sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>)'s not disturbed and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) doesn't see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) doesn't want to see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pitcher</b></font>)</div><p/>And then Mary Lennox was led up a broad staircase and down a long corridor and up a short flight of steps and through another corridor and another, until a door opened in a wall and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) found herself in a room with a fire in it and a supper on a table.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock said unceremoniously:  <div class="bookquote">``Well, here you are!
<p/>This room and the next are where you'll live--and you must keep to them.
<p/>Don't you forget that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div><p/>It was in this way Mistress Mary arrived at Misselthwaite Manor and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life.
<p/>CHAPTER IV  MARTHA   When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes in the morning it was because a young housemaid had come into her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) room to light the fire and was kneeling on the hearth-rug raking out the cinders noisily.
<p/>Mary lay and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) for a few moments and then began to look about the room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never seen a room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy.
<p/>The walls were covered with tapestry with a forest scene embroidered on it.
<p/>There were fantastically dressed people under the trees and in the distance there was a glimpse of the turrets of a castle.
<p/>There were hunters and horses and dogs and ladies.
<p/>Mary felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were in the forest with them.
<p/>Out of a deep window she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could see a great climbing stretch of land which seemed to have no trees on it, and to look rather like an endless, dull, purplish sea.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, pointing out of the window.
<p/>Martha, the young housemaid, who had just risen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) feet, looked and pointed also.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's th' moor,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with a good-natured grin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does tha' like it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's because tha`rt not used to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>Martha said, going back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hearth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' thinks it's too big an' bare now.
<p/>But tha' will like it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>inquired Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, that I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>answered Martha, cheerfully polishing away at the grate.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I just love it.
<p/>It's none bare.
<p/>It's covered wi' growin' things as smells sweet.
<p/>It's fair lovely in spring an' summer when th' gorse an' broom an' heather's in flower.
<p/>It smells o' honey an' there's such a lot o' fresh air--an' th' sky looks so high an' th' bees an' skylarks makes such a nice noise hummin' an' singin'.
<p/>Eh!
<p/>I wouldn't live away from th' moor for anythin'.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with a grave, puzzled expression.
<p/>The native servants she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been used to in India were not in the least like this.
<p/>They were obsequious and servile and did not presume to talk to their masters as if they were their equals.
<p/>They made salaams and called them <div class="bookquote">``protector of the poor''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and names of that sort.
<p/>Indian servants were commanded to do things, not asked.
<p/>It was not the custom to say <div class="bookquote">``please''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``thank you''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>and Mary had always slapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Ayah in the face when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was angry.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wondered a little what this girl would do if one slapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in the face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a round, rosy, good-natured-looking creature, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a sturdy way which made Mistress Mary wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might not even slap back--if the person who slapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was only a little girl.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a strange servant,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pillows, rather haughtily.
<p/>Martha sat up on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) heels, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) blacking-brush in her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hand, and laughed, without seeming the least out of temper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>I know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If there was a grand Missus at Misselthwaite I should never have been even one of th' under house-maids.
<p/>I might have been let to be scullerymaid but I'd never have been let upstairs.
<p/>I'm too common an' I talk too much Yorkshire.
<p/>But this is a funny house for all it's so grand.
<p/>Seems like there's neither Master nor Mistress except Mr. Pitcher an' Mrs. Medlock.
<p/>Mr. Craven, he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) won't be troubled about anythin' when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s here, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s nearly always away.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock gave me th' place out o' kindness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) could never have done it if Misselthwaite had been like other big houses.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to be my servant?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary asked, still in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) imperious little Indian way.
<p/>Martha began to rub her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) grate again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm Mrs. Medlock's servant,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said stoutly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>)'s Mr. Craven's--but I'm to do the housemaid's work up here an' wait on you a bit.
<p/>But you won't need much waitin' on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is going to dress me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>demanded Mary.
<p/>Martha sat up on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) heels again and stared.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spoke in broad Yorkshire in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) amazement.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Canna' tha' dress thysen!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?
<p/>I don't understand your language,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>I forgot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>Martha said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Medlock told me I'd have to be careful or you wouldn't know what I was sayin'.
<p/>I mean can't you put on your own clothes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary, quite indignantly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never did in my life.
<p/>My Ayah dressed me, of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha, evidently not in the least aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was impudent, <div class="bookquote">``it's time tha' should learn.
<p/>Tha' cannot begin younger.
<p/>It'll do thee good to wait on thysen a bit.
<p/>My mother always said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) couldn't see why grand people's children didn't turn out fair fools--what with nurses an' bein' washed an' dressed an' took out to walk as if they was puppies!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is different in India,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mistress</b></font>)</div>said Mistress Mary disdainfully.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could scarcely stand this.
<p/>But Martha was not at all crushed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>I can see it's different,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) answered almost sympathetically.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say it's because there's such a lot o' blacks there instead o' respectable white people.
<p/>When I heard you was comin' from India I thought you was a black too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary sat up in bed furious.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!
<p/>You thought I was a native.
<p/>You--you daughter of a pig!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>Martha stared and looked hot.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are you callin' names?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't be so vexed.
<p/>That's not th' way for a young lady to talk.
<p/>I've nothin' against th' blacks.
<p/>When you read about 'em in tracts they're always very religious.
<p/>You always read as a black's a man an' a brother.
<p/>I've never seen a black an' I was fair pleased to think I was goin' to see one close.
<p/>When I come in to light your fire this mornin' I crep' up to your bed an' pulled th' cover back careful to look at you.
<p/>An' there you was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>disappointedly, <div class="bookquote">``no more black than me--for all you're so yeller.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary did not even try to control her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) rage and humiliation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You thought I was a native!
<p/>You dared!
<p/>You don't know anything about natives!
<p/>They are not people--they're servants who must salaam to you.
<p/>You know nothing about India.
<p/>You know nothing about anything!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was in such a rage and felt so helpless before the girl's simple stare, and somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) suddenly felt so horribly lonely and far away from everything she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) understood and which understood her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) threw herself face downward on the pillows and burst into passionate sobbing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sobbed so unrestrainedly that good-natured Yorkshire Martha was a little frightened and quite sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) went to the bed and bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>you mustn't cry like that there!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) begged.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't for sure.
<p/>I didn't know you'd be vexed.
<p/>I don't know anythin' about anythin'--just like you said.
<p/>I beg your pardon, Miss..
<p/>Do stop cryin'.''
 (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something comforting and really friendly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) queer Yorkshire speech and sturdy way which had a good effect on Mary.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gradually ceased crying and became quiet.
<p/>Martha looked relieved.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's time for thee to get up now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Medlock said I was to carry tha' breakfast an' tea an' dinner into th' room next to this.
<p/>It's been made into a nursery for thee.
<p/>I'll help thee on with thy clothes if tha'll get out o' bed.
<p/>If th' buttons are at th' back tha' cannot button them up tha`self.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>When Mary at last decided to get up, the clothes Martha took from the wardrobe were not the ones she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had worn when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) arrived the night before with Mrs. Medlock.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Those are not mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine are black.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) looked the thick white wool coat and dress over, and added with cool approval:  <div class="bookquote">``Those are nicer than mine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These are th' ones tha' must put on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>Martha answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Craven ordered Mrs. Medlock to get 'em in London.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate black things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/>The dressing process was one which taught them both something.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why doesn't tha' put on tha' own shoes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said when Mary quietly held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) foot.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Ayah did it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary, staring.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was the custom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said that very often--<div class="bookquote">``It was the custom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>The native servants were always saying it.
<p/>If one told them to do a thing their ancestors had not done for a thousand years they gazed at one mildly and said, <div class="bookquote">``It is not the custom''  (<font color='red'><b>ancestors</b></font>)</div>and one knew that was the end of the matter.
<p/>It had not been the custom that Mistress Mary should do anything but stand and allow herself to be dressed like a doll, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was ready for breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to suspect that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life at Misselthwaite Manor would end by teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a number of things quite new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)--things such as putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own shoes and stockings, and picking up things she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) let fall.
<p/>If Martha had been a well-trained fine young lady's maid she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) would have been more subservient and respectful and would have known that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) business to brush hair, and button boots, and pick things up and lay them away.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was, however, only an untrained Yorkshire rustic who had been brought up in a moorland cottage with a swarm of little brothers and sisters who had never dreamed of doing anything but waiting on themselves and on the younger ones who were either babies in arms or just learning to totter about and tumble over things.
<p/>If Mary Lennox had been a child who was ready to be amused she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) would perhaps have laughed at Martha's readiness to talk, but Mary only listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) coldly and wondered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) freedom of manner.
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not at all interested, but gradually, as the girl rattled on in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) good-tempered, homely way, Mary began to notice what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was saying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>you should see 'em all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's twelve of us an' my father only gets sixteen shilling a week.
<p/>I can tell you my mother's put to it to get porridge for 'em all.
<p/>They tumble about on th' moor an' play there all day an' mother says th' air of th' moor fattens 'em.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) believes they eat th' grass same as th' wild ponies do.
<p/>Our Dickon, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s twelve years old and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s got a young pony he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) calls his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) get it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) found it on th' moor with its mother when it was a little one an' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) began to make friends with it an' give it bits o' bread an' pluck young grass for it.
<p/>And it got to like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so it follows him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) about an' it lets him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) get on its back.
<p/>Dickon's a kind lad an' animals likes him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary had never possessed an animal pet of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own and had always thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should like one.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to feel a slight interest in Dickon, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never before been interested in any one but herself, it was the dawning of a healthy sentiment.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went into the room which had been made into a nursery for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found that it was rather like the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had slept in.
<p/>It was not a child's room, but a grown-up person's room, with gloomy old pictures on the walls and heavy old oak chairs.
<p/>A table in the center was set with a good substantial breakfast.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had always had a very small appetite, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked with something more than indifference at the first plate Martha set before her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' doesn't want thy porridge!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>Martha exclaimed incredulously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' doesn't know how good it is.
<p/>Put a bit o' treacle on it or a bit o' sugar.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>repeated Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>said Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't abide to see good victuals go to waste.
<p/>If our children was at this table they'd clean it bare in five minutes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary coldly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>echoed Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because they scarce ever had their stomachs full in their lives.
<p/>They're as hungry as young hawks an' foxes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what it is to be hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, with the indifference of ignorance.
<p/>Martha looked indignant.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it would do thee good to try it.
<p/>I can see that plain enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said outspokenly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no patience with folk as sits an' just stares at good bread an' meat.
<p/>My word!
<p/>don't I wish Dickon and Phil an' Jane an' th' rest of 'em had what's here under their pinafores.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you take it to them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>suggested Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>answered Martha stoutly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' this isn't my day out.
<p/>I get my day out once a month same as th' rest.
<p/>Then I go home an' clean up for mother an' give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a day's rest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary drank some tea and ate a little toast and some marmalade.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wrap up warm an' run out an' play you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll do you good and give you some stomach for your meat.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary went to the window.
<p/>There were gardens and paths and big trees, but everything looked dull and wintry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Out?
<p/>Why should I go out on a day like this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if tha' doesn't go out tha`lt have to stay in, an' what has tha' got to do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary glanced about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>There was nothing to do.
<p/>When Mrs. Medlock had prepared the nursery she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had not thought of amusement.
<p/>Perhaps it would be better to go and see what the gardens were like.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who will go with me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) inquired.
<p/>Martha stared.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll go by yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have to learn to play like other children does when they haven't got sisters and brothers.
<p/>Our Dickon goes off on th' moor by himself an' plays for hours.
<p/>That's how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made friends with th' pony.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'s got sheep on th' moor that knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), an' birds as comes an' eats out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand.
<p/>However little there is to eat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) always saves a bit o' his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bread to coax his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pets.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>It was really this mention of Dickon which made Mary decide to go out, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not aware of it.
<p/>There would be, birds outside though there would not be ponies or sheep.
<p/>They would be different from the birds in India and it might amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to look at them.
<p/>Martha found her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) coat and hat for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) and a pair of stout little boots and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) way downstairs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If tha' goes round that way tha'll come to th' gardens,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, pointing to a gate in a wall of shrubbery.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's lots o' flowers in summer-time, but there's nothin' bloomin' now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) seemed to hesitate a second before she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``One of th' gardens is locked up.
<p/>No one has been in it for ten years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Mary in spite of herself.
<p/>Here was another locked door added to the hundred in the strange house.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Craven had it shut when his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) wife died so sudden.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) won't let no one go inside.
<p/>It was her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) garden.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) locked th' door an' dug a hole and buried th' key.
<p/>There's Mrs. Medlock's bell ringing--I must run.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>After she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was gone Mary turned down the walk which led to the door in the shrubbery.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) could not help thinking about the garden which no one had been into for ten years.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) wondered what it would look like and whether there were any flowers still alive in it.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had passed through the shrubbery gate she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) found herself in great gardens, with wide lawns and winding walks with clipped borders.
<p/>There were trees, and flower-beds, and evergreens clipped into strange shapes, and a large pool with an old gray fountain in its midst.
<p/>But the flower-beds were bare and wintry and the fountain was not playing.
<p/>This was not the garden which was shut up.
<p/>How could a garden be shut up?
<p/>You could always walk into a garden.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was just thinking this when she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) saw that, at the end of the path she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was following, there seemed to be a long wall, with ivy growing over it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was not familiar enough with England to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was coming upon the kitchen-gardens where the vegetables and fruit were growing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) went toward the wall and found that there was a green door in the ivy, and that it stood open.
<p/>This was not the closed garden, evidently, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) could go into it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) went through the door and found that it was a garden with walls all round it and that it was only one of several walled gardens which seemed to open into one another.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) saw another open green door, revealing bushes and pathways between beds containing winter vegetables.
<p/>Fruit-trees were trained flat against the wall, and over some of the beds there were glass frames.
<p/>The place was bare and ugly enough, Mary thought, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stood and stared about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>It might be nicer in summer when things were green, but there was nothing pretty about it now.
<p/>Presently an old man with a spade over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder walked through the door leading from the second garden.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked startled when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw Mary, and then touched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cap.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a surly old face, and did not seem at all pleased to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)--but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was displeased with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) garden and wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``quite contrary''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>expression, and certainly did not seem at all pleased to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this place?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One o' th' kitchen-gardens,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary, pointing through the other green door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Another of 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shortly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's another on t`other side o' th' wall an' there's th' orchard t`other side o' that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I go in them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If tha' likes.
<p/>But there's nowt to see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary made no response.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went down the path and through the second green door.
<p/>There, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found more walls and winter vegetables and glass frames, but in the second wall there was another green door and it was not open.
<p/>Perhaps it led into the garden which no one had seen for ten years.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not at all a timid child and always did what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to do, Mary went to the green door and turned the handle.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hoped the door would not open because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to be sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had found the mysterious garden--but it did open quite easily and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked through it and found herself in an orchard.
<p/>There were walls all round it also and trees trained against them, and there were bare fruit-trees growing in the winter-browned grass--but there was no green door to be seen anywhere.
<p/>Mary looked for it, and yet when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had entered the upper end of the garden she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had noticed that the wall did not seem to end with the orchard but to extend beyond it as if it enclosed a place at the other side.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could see the tops of trees above the wall, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stood still she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw a bird with a bright red breast sitting on the topmost branch of one of them, and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) burst into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) winter song--almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had caught sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and was calling to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stopped and listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and somehow his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cheerful, friendly little whistle gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a pleased feeling--even a disagreeable little girl may be lonely, and the big closed house and big bare moor and big bare gardens had made this one feel as if there was no one left in the world but herself.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been an affectionate child, who had been used to being loved, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would have broken her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart, but even though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``Mistress Mary Quite Contrary''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was desolate, and the bright-breasted little bird brought a look into her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sour little face which was almost a smile.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flew away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not like an Indian bird and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should ever see him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) again.
<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lived in the mysterious garden and knew all about it.
<p/>Perhaps it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had nothing whatever to do that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought so much of the deserted garden.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was curious about it and wanted to see what it was like.
<p/>Why had Mr. Archibald Craven buried the key?
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) wife so much why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) hate her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) garden?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should ever see him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew that if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) would not like her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should only stand and stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) and say nothing, though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should be wanting dreadfully to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had done such a queer thing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``People never like me and I never like people,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I never can talk as the Crawford children could.
<p/>They were always talking and laughing and making noises.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) thought of the robin and of the way he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) seemed to sing his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) song at her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) remembered the tree-top he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) perched on she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) stopped rather suddenly on the path.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that tree was in the secret garden--I feel sure it was,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a wall round the place and there was no door.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) walked back into the first kitchen-garden she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had entered and found the old man digging there.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) went and stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a few moments in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cold little way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took no notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) and so at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been into the other gardens,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was nothin' to prevent thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered crustily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I went into the orchard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was no dog at th' door to bite thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was no door there into the other garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What garden?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said in a rough voice, stopping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) digging for a moment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The one on the other side of the wall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mistress</b></font>)</div>answered Mistress Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are trees there--I saw the tops of them.
<p/>A bird with a red breast was sitting on one of them and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sang.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) surprise the surly old weather-beaten face actually changed its expression.
<p/>A slow smile spread over it and the gardener looked quite different.
<p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) think that it was curious how much nicer a person looked when he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) smiled.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not thought of it before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) turned about to the orchard side of his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) garden and began to whistle--a low soft whistle.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not understand how such a surly man could make such a coaxing sound.
<p/>Almost the next moment a wonderful thing happened.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard a soft little rushing flight through the air--and it was the bird with the red breast flying to them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) actually alighted on the big clod of earth quite near to the gardener's foot.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>chuckled the old man, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke to the bird as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were speaking to a child.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where has tha' been, tha' cheeky little beggar?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've not seen thee before today.
<p/>Has tha, begun tha' courtin' this early in th' season?
<p/>Tha`rt too forrad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The bird put his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) tiny head on one side and looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) soft bright eye which was like a black dewdrop.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) seemed quite familiar and not the least afraid.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) hopped about and pecked the earth briskly, looking for seeds and insects.
<p/>It actually gave Mary a queer feeling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart, because he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) was so pretty and cheerful and seemed so like a person.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) had a tiny plump body and a delicate beak, and slender delicate legs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) always come when you call him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked almost in a whisper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, that he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) will.
<p/>I've knowed him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) was a fledgling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) come out of th' nest in th' other garden an' when first he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) flew over th' wall he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) was too weak to fly back for a few days an' we got friendly.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) went over th' wall again th' rest of th' brood was gone an' he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) was lonely an' he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) come back to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What kind of a bird is he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't tha' know?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)'s a robin redbreast an' they're th' friendliest, curiousest birds alive.
<p/>They're almost as friendly as dogs--if you know how to get on with 'em.
<p/>Watch him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) peckin' about there an' lookin' round at us now an' again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) knows we're talkin' about him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the queerest thing in the world to see the old fellow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) looked at the plump little scarlet-waistcoated bird as if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) were both proud and fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s a conceited one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) chuckled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) likes to hear folk talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s always comin' to see what I'm plantin'.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knows all th' things Mester Craven never troubles hissel' to find out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s th' head gardener, he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The robin</b></font>)</div><p/>The robin hopped about busily pecking the soil and now and then stopped and looked at them a little.
<p/>Mary thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) black dewdrop eyes gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with great curiosity.
<p/>It really seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) were finding out all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>The queer feeling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart increased.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did the rest of the brood fly to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no knowin'.
<p/>The old ones turn 'em out o' their nest an' make 'em fly an' they're scattered before you know it.
<p/>This one was a knowin' one an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was lonely.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>Mistress Mary went a step nearer to the robin and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) very hard.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm lonely,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not known before that this was one of the things which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feel sour and cross.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) seemed to find it out when the robin looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked at the robin.
<p/>The old gardener pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) cap back on his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) bald head and stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a minute.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Art tha' th' little wench from India?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) asked.
<p/>Mary nodded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then no wonder tha`rt lonely.
<p/>Tha`lt be lonlier before tha's done,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) said.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) began to dig again, driving his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) spade deep into the rich black garden soil while the robin hopped about very busily employed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is your name?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary inquired.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) stood up to answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ben Weatherstaff,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) answered, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) added with a surly chuckle, <div class="bookquote">``I'm lonely mysel' except when he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'s with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) jerked his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) thumb toward the robin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'s th' only friend I've got.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no friends at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never had.
<p/>My Ayah didn't like me and I never played with any one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>It is a Yorkshire habit to say what you think with blunt frankness, and old Ben Weatherstaff was a Yorkshire moor man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' an' me are a good bit alike,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We was wove out of th' same cloth.
<p/>We're neither of us good lookin' an' we're both of us as sour as we look.
<p/>We've got the same nasty tempers, both of us, I'll warrant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>This was plain speaking, and Mary Lennox had never heard the truth about herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) life.
<p/>Native servants always salaamed and submitted to you, whatever you did.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) had never thought much about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) looks, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) was as unattractive as Ben Weatherstaff and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) also wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) looked as sour as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had looked before the robin came.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) actually began to wonder also if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``nasty tempered.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) felt uncomfortable.
<p/>Suddenly a clear rippling little sound broke out near her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) turned round.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) was standing a few feet from a young apple-tree and the robin had flown on to one of its branches and had burst out into a scrap of a song.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff laughed outright.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) do that for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'s made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) mind to make friends with thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>replied Ben.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dang me if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) hasn't took a fancy to thee.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) moved toward the little tree softly and looked up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you make friends with me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to the robin just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was speaking to a person.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not say it either in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hard little voice or in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) imperious Indian voice, but in a tone so soft and eager and coaxing that Ben Weatherstaff was as surprised as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) whistle.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) cried out, <div class="bookquote">``tha' said that as nice an' human as if tha' was a real child instead of a sharp old woman.
<p/>Tha' said it almost like Dickon talks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) wild things on th' moor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know Dickon?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary asked, turning round rather in a hurry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>).
<p/>Dickon's wanderin' about everywhere.
<p/>Th' very blackberries an' heather-bells knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>).
<p/>I warrant th' foxes shows him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) where their cubs lies an' th' skylarks doesn't hide their nests from him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary would have liked to ask some more questions.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was almost as curious about Dickon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was about the deserted garden.
<p/>But just that moment the robin, who had ended his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) song, gave a little shake of his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) wings, spread them and flew away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) visit and had other things to do.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) has flown over the wall!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) has flown into the orchard--he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) has flown across the other wall--into the garden where there is no door!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) lives there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said old Ben.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rose-trees,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are there rose-trees?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>Ben Weatherstaff took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) spade again and began to dig.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was ten year' ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) mumbled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to see them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is the green door?
<p/>There must be a door somewhere.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>Ben drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) spade deep and looked as uncompanionable as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) had looked when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was ten year' ago, but there isn't now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No door!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There must be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None as any one can find, an' none as is any one's business.

<p/>Get you gone an' play you.
<p/>I've no more time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) actually stopped digging, threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) spade over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) shoulder and walked off, without even glancing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) or saying good-by.
<p/>CHAPTER V  THE CRY IN THE CORRIDOR   At first each day which passed by for Mary Lennox was exactly like the others.
<p/>Every morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) awoke in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) tapestried room and found Martha kneeling upon the hearth building her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) fire; every morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) ate her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) breakfast in the nursery which had nothing amusing in it; and after each breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) gazed out of the window across to the huge moor which seemed to spread out on all sides and climb up to the sky, and after she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had stared for a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) realized that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not go out she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) would have to stay in and do nothing--and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) went out.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not know that this was the best thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) could have done, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not know that, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) began to walk quickly or even run along the paths and down the avenue, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was stirring her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) slow blood and making herself stronger by fighting with the wind which swept down from the moor.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) ran only to make herself warm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hated the wind which rushed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) face and roared and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) back as if it were some giant she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) could not see.
<p/>But the big breaths of rough fresh air blown over the heather filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) lungs with something which was good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) whole thin body and whipped some red color into her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) cheeks and brightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) dull eyes when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not know anything about it.
<p/>But after a few days spent almost entirely out of doors she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) wakened one morning knowing what it was to be hungry, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) sat down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not glance disdainfully at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) porridge and push it away, but took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) spoon and began to eat it and went on eating it until her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) bowl was empty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' got on well enough with that this mornin', didn't tha'?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>said Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It tastes nice today,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, feeling a little surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) self.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's th' air of th' moor that's givin' thee stomach for tha' victuals,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>answered Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's lucky for thee that tha's got victuals as well as appetite.
<p/>There's been twelve in our cottage as had th' stomach an' nothin' to put in it.
<p/>You go on playin' you out o' doors every day an' you'll get some flesh on your bones an' you won't be so yeller.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't play,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to play with.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothin' to play with!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>exclaimed Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our children plays with sticks and stones.
<p/>They just runs about an' shouts an' looks at things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary did not shout, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked at things.
<p/>There was nothing else to do.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked round and round the gardens and wandered about the paths in the park.
<p/>Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked for Ben Weatherstaff, but though several times she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) at work he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was too busy to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) or was too surly.
<p/>Once when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was walking toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) spade and turned away as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did it on purpose.
<p/>One place she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went to oftener than to any other.
<p/>It was the long walk outside the gardens with the walls round them.
<p/>There were bare flower-beds on either side of it and against the walls ivy grew thickly.
<p/>There was one part of the wall where the creeping dark green leaves were more bushy than elsewhere.
<p/>It seemed as if for a long time that part had been neglected.
<p/>The rest of it had been clipped and made to look neat, but at this lower end of the walk it had not been trimmed at all.
<p/>A few days after she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had talked to Ben Weatherstaff, Mary stopped to notice this and wondered why it was so.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had just paused and was looking up at a long spray of ivy swinging in the wind when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw a gleam of scarlet and heard a brilliant chirp, and there, on the top of the wall, forward perched Ben Weatherstaff's robin redbreast, tilting forward to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) small head on one side.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cried out, <div class="bookquote">``is it you--is it you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And it did not seem at all queer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) would understand and answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did answer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) twittered and chirped and hopped along the wall as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) were telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) all sorts of things.
<p/>It seemed to Mistress Mary as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>), too, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was not speaking in words.
<p/>It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said:  <div class="bookquote">``Good morning!
<p/>Isn't the wind nice?
<p/>Isn't the sun nice?
<p/>Isn't everything nice?
<p/>Let us both chirp and hop and twitter.
<p/>Come on!
<p/>Come on!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary began to laugh, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) hopped and took little flights along the wall she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>).
<p/>Poor little thin, sallow, ugly Mary--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) actually looked almost pretty for a moment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like you!
<p/>I like you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cried out, pattering down the walk; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) chirped and tried to whistle, which last she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know how to do in the least.
<p/>But the robin seemed to be quite satisfied and chirped and whistled back at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) spread his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) wings and made a darting flight to the top of a tree, where he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) perched and sang loudly.
<p/>That reminded Mary of the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had been swinging on a tree-top then and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been standing in the orchard.
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was on the other side of the orchard and standing in the path outside a wall--much lower down--and there was the same tree inside.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's in the garden no one can go into,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the garden without a door.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) lives in there.
<p/>How I wish I could see what it is like!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran up the walk to the green door she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had entered the first morning.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran down the path through the other door and then into the orchard, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stood and looked up there was the tree on the other side of the wall, and there was the robin just finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) song and, beginning to preen his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) feathers with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) beak.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked round and looked closely at that side of the orchard wall, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) only found what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had found before--that there was no door in it.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran through the kitchen-gardens again and out into the walk outside the long ivy-covered wall, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked to the end of it and looked at it, but there was no door; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked to the other end, looking again, but there was no door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very queer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ben Weatherstaff said there was no door and there is no door.
<p/>But there must have been one ten years ago, because Mr. Craven buried the key.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) so much to think of that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to be quite interested and feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not sorry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had come to Misselthwaite Manor.
<p/>In India she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had always felt hot and too languid to care much about anything.
<p/>The fact was that the fresh wind from the moor had begun to blow the cobwebs out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) young brain and to waken her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) up a little.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stayed out of doors nearly all day, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sat down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) supper at night she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not feel cross when Martha chattered away.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) rather liked to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>), and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) would ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) a question.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) asked it after she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) supper and had sat down on the hearth-rug before the fire.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did Mr. Craven hate the garden?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had made Martha stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) and Martha had not objected at all.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was very young, and used to a crowded cottage full of brothers and sisters, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) found it dull in the great servants' hall downstairs where the footman and upper-housemaids made fun of her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) Yorkshire speech and looked upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) as a common little thing, and sat and whispered among themselves.
<p/>Martha liked to talk, and the strange child who had lived in India, and been waited upon by <div class="bookquote">``blacks,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>was novelty enough to attract her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) sat down on the hearth herself without waiting to be asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Art tha' thinkin' about that garden yet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew tha' would.
<p/>That was just the way with me when I first heard about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hate it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary persisted.
<p/>Martha tucked her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) feet under her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) and made herself quite comfortable.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen to th' wind wutherin' round the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You could bare stand up on the moor if you was out on it tonight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary did not know what <div class="bookquote">``wutherin'''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>meant until she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) listened, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) understood.
<p/>It must mean that hollow shuddering sort of roar which rushed round and round the house as if the giant no one could see were buffeting it and beating at the walls and windows to try to break in.
<p/>But one knew he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could not get in, and somehow it made one feel very safe and warm inside a room with a red coal fire.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why did he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hate it so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had listened.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) intended to know if Martha did.
<p/>Then Martha gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) store of knowledge.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Medlock said it's not to be talked about.
<p/>There's lots o' things in this place that's not to be talked over.
<p/>That's Mr. Craven's orders.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) troubles are none servants' business, he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) says.
<p/>But for th' garden he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) wouldn't be like he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) is.
<p/>It was Mrs. Craven's garden that she (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had made when first they were married an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) just loved it, an' they used to `tend the flowers themselves.
<p/>An' none o' th' gardeners was ever let to go in.
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) an' her (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) used to go in an' shut th' door an' stay there hours an' hours, readin' and talkin'.
<p/>An' she (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was just a bit of a girl an' there was an old tree with a branch bent like a seat on it.
<p/>An' she (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) made roses grow over it an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) used to sit there.
<p/>But one day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was sittin' there th' branch broke an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) fell on th' ground an' was hurt so bad that next day she (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) died.
<p/>Th' doctors thought he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'d go out o' his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mind an' die, too.
<p/>That's why he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hates it.
<p/>No one's never gone in since, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) won't let any one talk about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary did not ask any more questions.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked at the red fire and listened to the wind <div class="bookquote">``wutherin'.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed to be <div class="bookquote">``wutherin'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>louder than ever.
<p/>At that moment a very good thing was happening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>Four good things had happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), in fact, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came to Misselthwaite Manor.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had understood a robin and that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had run in the wind until her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) blood had grown warm; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been healthily hungry for the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had found out what it was to be sorry for some one.
<p/>But as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was listening to the wind she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to listen to something else.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know what it was, because at first she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could scarcely distinguish it from the wind itself.
<p/>It was a curious sound--it seemed almost as if a child were crying somewhere.
<p/>Sometimes the wind sounded rather like a child crying, but presently Mistress Mary felt quite sure this sound was inside the house, not outside it.
<p/>It was far away, but it was inside.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned round and looked at Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you hear any one crying?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/>Martha suddenly looked confused.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's th' wind.
<p/>Sometimes it sounds like as if some one was lost on th' moor an' wailin'.
<p/>It's got all sorts o' sounds.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's in the house--down one of those long corridors.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And at that very moment a door must have been opened somewhere downstairs; for a great rushing draft blew along the passage and the door of the room they sat in was blown open with a crash, and as they both jumped to their feet the light was blown out and the crying sound was swept down the far corridor so that it was to be heard more plainly than ever.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you so!
<p/>It is some one crying--and it isn't a grown-up person.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>Martha ran and shut the door and turned the key, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did it they both heard the sound of a door in some far passage shutting with a bang, and then everything was quiet, for even the wind ceased <div class="bookquote">``wutherin'''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>for a few moments.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was th' wind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha stubbornly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' if it wasn't, it was little Betty Butterworth, th' scullery-maid.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>)'s had th' toothache all day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>But something troubled and awkward in her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) manner made Mistress Mary stare very hard at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was speaking the truth.
<p/>CHAPTER VI  <div class="bookquote">``THERE WAS SOME ONE CRYING--THERE WAS!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day the rain poured down in torrents again, and when Mary looked out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) window the moor was almost hidden by gray mist and cloud.
<p/>There could be no going out today.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Try to keep from under each other's feet mostly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>Martha answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>there does seem a lot of us then.
<p/>Mother's a good-tempered woman but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) gets fair moithered.
<p/>The biggest ones goes out in th' cow-shed and plays there.
<p/>Dickon he (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) doesn't mind th' wet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) goes out just th' same as if th' sun was shinin'.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) sees things on rainy days as doesn't show when it's fair weather.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) once found a little fox cub half drowned in its hole and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) brought it home in th' bosom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) shirt to keep it warm.
<p/>Its mother had been killed nearby an' th' hole was swum out an' th' rest o' th' litter was dead.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s got it at home now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) found a half-drowned young crow another time an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) brought it home, too, an' tamed it.
<p/>It's named Soot because it's so black, an' it hops an' flies about with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) everywhere.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>The time had come when Mary had forgotten to resent Martha's familiar talk.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stopped or went away.
<p/>The stories she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been told by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Ayah when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lived in India had been quite unlike those Martha had to tell about the moorland cottage which held fourteen people who lived in four little rooms and never had quite enough to eat.
<p/>The children seemed to tumble about and amuse themselves like a litter of rough, good-natured collie puppies.
<p/>Mary was most attracted by the mother and Dickon.
<p/>When Martha told stories of what <div class="bookquote">``mother''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said or did they always sounded comfortable.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had a raven or a fox cub I could play with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>Martha looked perplexed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can tha' knit?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can tha' sew?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can tha' read?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why doesn't tha, read somethin', or learn a bit o' spellin'?
<p/>Tha`st old enough to be learnin' thy book a good bit now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't any books,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Those I had were left in India.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Mrs. Medlock'd let thee go into th' library, there's thousands o' books there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary did not ask where the library was, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was suddenly inspired by a new idea.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind to go and find it herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not troubled about Mrs. Medlock.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock seemed always to be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) comfortable housekeeper's sitting-room downstairs.
<p/>In this queer place one scarcely ever saw any one at all.
<p/>In fact, there was no one to see but the servants, and when their master was away they lived a luxurious life below stairs, where there was a huge kitchen hung about with shining brass and pewter, and a large servants' hall where there were four or five abundant meals eaten every day, and where a great deal of lively romping went on when Mrs. Medlock was out of the way.
<p/>Mary's meals were served regularly, and Martha waited on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>), but no one troubled themselves about her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) in the least.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock came and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) every day or two, but no one inquired what she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) did or told her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) what to do.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) supposed that perhaps this was the English way of treating children.
<p/>In India she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had always been attended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) Ayah, who had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) about and waited on her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>), hand and foot.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had often been tired of her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) company.
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was followed by nobody and was learning to dress herself because Martha looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was silly and stupid when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) wanted to have things handed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) and put on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hasn't tha' got good sense?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said once, when Mary had stood waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gloves for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our Susan Ann is twice as sharp as thee an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>)'s only four year' old.
<p/>Sometimes tha' looks fair soft in th' head.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary had worn her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) contrary scowl for an hour after that, but it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) think several entirely new things.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after Martha had swept up the hearth for the last time and gone downstairs.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was thinking over the new idea which had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) heard of the library.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not care very much about the library itself, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had read very few books; but to hear of it brought back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) mind the hundred rooms with closed doors.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) wondered if they were all really locked and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) would find if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) could get into any of them.
<p/>Were there a hundred really?
<p/>Why shouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) go and see how many doors she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) could count?
<p/>It would be something to do on this morning when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) could not go out.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had never been taught to ask permission to do things, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) knew nothing at all about authority, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) would not have thought it necessary to ask Mrs. Medlock if she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) might walk about the house, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) opened the door of the room and went into the corridor, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) began her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) wanderings.
<p/>It was a long corridor and it branched into other corridors and it led her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) up short flights of steps which mounted to others again.
<p/>There were doors and doors, and there were pictures on the walls.
<p/>Sometimes they were pictures of dark, curious landscapes, but oftenest they were portraits of men and women in queer, grand costumes made of satin and velvet.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) found herself in one long gallery whose walls were covered with these portraits.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had never thought there could be so many in any house.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) walked slowly down this place and stared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) felt as if they were wondering what a little girl from India was doing in their house.
<p/>Some were pictures of children--little girls in thick satin frocks which reached to their feet and stood out about them, and boys with puffed sleeves and lace collars and long hair, or with big ruffs around their necks.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) always stopped to look at the children, and wonder what their names were, and where they had gone, and why they wore such odd clothes.
<p/>There was a stiff, plain little girl rather like herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wore a green brocade dress and held a green parrot on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) finger.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes had a sharp, curious look.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do you live now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary aloud to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you were here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>no girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Surely no other little girl ever spent such a queer morning.
<p/>It seemed as if there was no one in all the huge rambling house but her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own small self, wandering about upstairs and down, through narrow passages and wide ones, where it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that no one but herself had ever walked.
<p/>Since so many rooms had been built, people must have lived in them, but it all seemed so empty that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not quite believe it true.
<p/>It was not until she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) climbed to the second floor that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought of turning the handle of a door.
<p/>All the doors were shut, as Mrs. Medlock had said they were, but at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) hand on the handle of one of them and turned it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was almost frightened for a moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) felt that it turned without difficulty and that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) pushed upon the door itself it slowly and heavily opened.
<p/>It was a massive door and opened into a big bedroom.
<p/>There were embroidered hangings on the wall, and inlaid furniture such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had seen in India stood about the room.
<p/>A broad window with leaded panes looked out upon the moor; and over the mantel was another portrait of the stiff, plain little girl who seemed to stare at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) more curiously than ever.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) slept here once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stares at me so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) makes me feel queer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>After that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opened more doors and more.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw so many rooms that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) became quite tired and began to think that there must be a hundred, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not counted them.
<p/>In all of them there were old pictures or old tapestries with strange scenes worked on them.
<p/>There were curious pieces of furniture and curious ornaments in nearly all of them.
<p/>In one room, which looked like a lady's sitting-room, the hangings were all embroidered velvet, and in a cabinet were about a hundred little elephants made of ivory.
<p/>They were of different sizes, and some had their mahouts or palanquins on their backs.
<p/>Some were much bigger than the others and some were so tiny that they seemed only babies.
<p/>Mary had seen carved ivory in India and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew all about elephants.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opened the door of the cabinet and stood on a footstool and played with these for quite a long time.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) got tired she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) set the elephants in order and shut the door of the cabinet.
<p/>In all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanderings through the long corridors and the empty rooms, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had seen nothing alive; but in this room she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw something.
<p/>Just after she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had closed the cabinet door she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard a tiny rustling sound.
<p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) jump and look around at the sofa by the fireplace, from which it seemed to come.
<p/>In the corner of the sofa there was a cushion, and in the velvet which covered it there was a hole, and out of the hole peeped a tiny head with a pair of frightened eyes in it.
<p/>Mary crept softly across the room to look.
<p/>The bright eyes belonged to a little gray mouse, and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion and made a comfortable nest there.
<p/>Six baby mice were cuddled up asleep near her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>If there was no one else alive in the hundred rooms there were seven mice who did not look lonely at all.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If they wouldn't be so frightened I would take them back with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had wandered about long enough to feel too tired to wander any farther, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned back.
<p/>Two or three times she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) way by turning down the wrong corridor and was obliged to ramble up and down until she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found the right one; but at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own floor again, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was some distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own room and did not know exactly where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe I have taken a wrong turning again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, standing still at what seemed the end of a short passage with tapestry on the wall.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know which way to go.
<p/>How still everything is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was standing here and just after she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had said this that the stillness was broken by a sound.
<p/>It was another cry, but not quite like the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had heard last night; it was only a short one, a fretful childish whine muffled by passing through walls.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's nearer than it was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart beating rather faster.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it is crying.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand accidentally upon the tapestry near her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and then sprang back, feeling quite startled.
<p/>The tapestry was the covering of a door which fell open and showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that there was another part of the corridor behind it, and Mrs. Medlock was coming up it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bunch of keys in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand and a very cross look on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took Mary by the arm and pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did I tell you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I turned round the wrong corner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>explained Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know which way to go and I heard some one crying.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) quite hated Mrs. Medlock at the moment, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) more the next.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't hear anything of the sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>said the housekeeper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You come along back to your own nursery or I'll box your ears.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) by the arm and half pushed, half pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) up one passage and down another until she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) in at the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) own room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you stay where you're told to stay or you'll find yourself locked up.
<p/>The master had better get you a governess, same as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would.
<p/>You're one that needs some one to look sharp after you.
<p/>I've got enough to do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) went out of the room and slammed the door after her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), and Mary went and sat on the hearth-rug, pale with rage.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not cry, but ground her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) teeth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was some one crying--there was--there was!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had heard it twice now, and sometime she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would find out.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had found out a great deal this morning.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been on a long journey, and at any rate she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had had something to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) all the time, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had played with the ivory elephants and had seen the gray mouse and its babies in their nest in the velvet cushion.
<p/>CHAPTER VII  THE KEY TO THE GARDEN   Two days after this, when Mary opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sat upright in bed immediately, and called to Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at the moor!
<p/>Look at the moor!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The rainstorm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been swept away in the night by the wind.
<p/>The wind itself had ceased and a brilliant, deep blue sky arched high over the moorland.
<p/>Never, never had Mary dreamed of a sky so blue.
<p/>In India skies were hot and blazing; this was of a deep cool blue which almost seemed to sparkle like the waters of some lovely bottomless lake, and here and there, high, high in the arched blueness floated small clouds of snow-white fleece.
<p/>The far-reaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead of gloomy purple-black or awful dreary gray.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha with a cheerful grin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Th' storm's over for a bit.
<p/>It does like this at this time o' th' year.
<p/>It goes off in a night like it was pretendin' it had never been here an' never meant to come again.
<p/>That's because th' springtime's on its way.
<p/>It's a long way off yet, but it's comin'.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark in England,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>no!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>said Martha, sitting up on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) heels among her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) black lead brushes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nowt o' th' soart!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does that mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Mary seriously.
<p/>In India the natives spoke different dialects which only a few people understood, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not surprised when Martha used words she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not know.
<p/>Martha laughed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had done the first morning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've talked broad Yorkshire again like Mrs. Medlock said I mustn't.
<p/>`Nowt o' th' soart' means `nothin'-of-the-sort,'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>slowly and carefully, <div class="bookquote">``but it takes so long to say it.
<p/>Yorkshire's th' sunniest place on earth when it is sunny.
<p/>I told thee tha'd like th' moor after a bit.
<p/>Just you wait till you see th' gold-colored gorse blossoms an' th' blossoms o' th' broom, an' th' heather flowerin', all purple bells, an' hundreds o' butterflies flutterin' an' bees hummin' an' skylarks soarin' up an' singin'.
<p/>You'll want to get out on it as sunrise an' live out on it all day like Dickon does.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Could I ever get there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Mary wistfully, looking through her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) window at the far-off blue.
<p/>It was so new and big and wonderful and such a heavenly color.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>answered Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha's never used tha' legs since tha' was born, it seems to me.
<p/>Tha' couldn't walk five mile.
<p/>It's five mile to our cottage.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to see your cottage.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>Martha stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) a moment curiously before she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) polishing brush and began to rub the grate again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was thinking that the small plain face did not look quite as sour at this moment as it had done the first morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) saw it.
<p/>It looked just a trifle like little Susan Ann's when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) wanted something very much.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll ask my mother about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>)'s one o' them that nearly always sees a way to do things.
<p/>It's my day out today an' I'm goin' home.
<p/>Eh!
<p/>I am glad.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock thinks a lot o' mother.
<p/>Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) could talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like your mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think tha' did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>agreed Martha, polishing away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, tha' hasn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>replied Martha.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) sat up on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) heels again and rubbed the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) nose with the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hand as if puzzled for a moment, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) ended quite positively.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>)'s that sensible an' hard workin' an' goodnatured an' clean that no one could help likin' her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) whether they'd seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) or not.
<p/>When I'm goin' home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) on my day out I just jump for joy when I'm crossin' the moor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like Dickon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>added Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I've never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha stoutly, <div class="bookquote">``I've told thee that th' very birds likes him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) an' th' rabbits an' wild sheep an' ponies, an' th' foxes themselves.
<p/>I wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) reflectively, <div class="bookquote">``what Dickon would think of thee?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wouldn't like me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stiff, cold little way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one does.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>Martha looked reflective again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How does tha' like thysel'?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) inquired, really quite as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) were curious to know.
<p/>Mary hesitated a moment and thought it over.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all--really,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I never thought of that before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>Martha grinned a little as if at some homely recollection.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother said that to me once,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) wash-tub an' I was in a bad temper an' talkin' ill of folk, an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) turns round on me an' says: `Tha' young vixen, tha'!
<p/>There tha' stands sayin' tha' doesn't like this one an' tha' doesn't like that one.
<p/>How does tha' like thysel'?'
<p/>It made me laugh an' it brought me to my senses in a minute.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) went away in high spirits as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) had given Mary her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breakfast.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was going to walk five miles across the moor to the cottage, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was going to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother with the washing and do the week's baking and enjoy herself thoroughly.
<p/>Mary felt lonelier than ever when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was no longer in the house.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went out into the garden as quickly as possible, and the first thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did was to run round and round the fountain flower garden ten times.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) counted the times carefully and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had finished she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt in better spirits.
<p/>The sunshine made the whole place look different.
<p/>The high, deep, blue sky arched over Misselthwaite as well as over the moor, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) kept lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face and looking up into it, trying to imagine what it would be like to lie down on one of the little snow-white clouds and float about.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went into the first kitchen-garden and found Ben Weatherstaff working there with two other gardeners.
<p/>The change in the weather seemed to have done him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) good.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) own accord.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Springtime's comin,'''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cannot tha' smell it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary sniffed and thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I smell something nice and fresh and damp,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's th' good rich earth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) answered, digging away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's in a good humor makin' ready to grow things.
<p/>It's glad when plantin' time comes.
<p/>It's dull in th' winter when it's got nowt to do.
<p/>In th' flower gardens out there things will be stirrin' down below in th' dark.
<p/>Th' sun's warmin' 'em.
<p/>You'll see bits o' green spikes stickin' out o' th' black earth after a bit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will they be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Crocuses an' snowdrops an' daffydowndillys.
<p/>Has tha' never seen them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.
<p/>Everything is hot, and wet, and green after the rains in India,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I think things grow up in a night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These won't grow up in a night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Weatherstaff.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha'll have to wait for 'em.
<p/>They'll poke up a bit higher here, an' push out a spike more there, an' uncurl a leaf this day an' another that.
<p/>You watch 'em.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary.
<p/>Very soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard the soft rustling flight of wings again and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew at once that the robin had come again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was very pert and lively, and hopped about so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feet, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) head on one side and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) so slyly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked Ben Weatherstaff a question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) remembers me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remembers thee!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>said Weatherstaff indignantly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) knows every cabbage stump in th' gardens, let alone th' people.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'s never seen a little wench here before, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'s bent on findin' out all about thee.
<p/>Tha's no need to try to hide anything from him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are things stirring down below in the dark in that garden where he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) lives?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary inquired.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What garden?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>grunted Weatherstaff, becoming surly again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The one where the old rose-trees are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not help asking, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted so much to know.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are all the flowers dead, or do some of them come again in the summer?
<p/>Are there ever any roses?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben Weatherstaff, hunching his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) shoulders toward the robin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'s the only one as knows.
<p/>No one else has seen inside it for ten year'.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Ten years was a long time, Mary thought.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been born ten years ago.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked away, slowly thinking.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had begun to like the garden just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had begun to like the robin and Dickon and Martha's mother.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was beginning to like Martha, too.
<p/>That seemed a good many people to like--when you were not used to liking.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) thought of the robin as one of the people.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) walk outside the long, ivy-covered wall over which she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) could see the tree-tops; and the second time she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) walked up and down the most interesting and exciting thing happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>), and it was all through Ben Weatherstaff's robin.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) heard a chirp and a twitter, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) looked at the bare flower-bed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) left side there he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was hopping about and pretending to peck things out of the earth to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had not followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) and the surprise so filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) with delight that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) almost trembled a little.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do remember me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) cried out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do!
<p/>You are prettier than anything else in the world!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) chirped, and talked, and coaxed and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) hopped, and flirted his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) tail and twittered.
<p/>It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) were talking.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) red waistcoat was like satin and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) puffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) tiny breast out and was so fine and so grand and so pretty that it was really as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) were showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) how important and like a human person a robin could be.
<p/>Mistress Mary forgot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had ever been contrary in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to draw closer and closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>), and bend down and talk and try to make something like robin sounds.
<p/>Oh!
<p/>to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) should actually let her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) come as near to him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) as that!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) knew nothing in the world would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand toward him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) or startle him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) in the least tiniest way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) knew it because he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was a real person--only nicer than any other person in the world.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was so happy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) scarcely dared to breathe.
<p/>The flower-bed was not quite bare.
<p/>It was bare of flowers because the perennial plants had been cut down for their winter rest, but there were tall shrubs and low ones which grew together at the back of the bed, and as the robin hopped about under them she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) hop over a small pile of freshly turned up earth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) stopped on it to look for a worm.
<p/>The earth had been turned up because a dog had been trying to dig up a mole and he (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>) had scratched quite a deep hole.
<p/>Mary looked at it, not really knowing why the hole was there, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw something almost buried in the newly-turned soil.
<p/>It was something like a ring of rusty iron or brass and when the robin flew up into a tree nearby she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand and picked the ring up.
<p/>It was more than a ring, however; it was an old key which looked as if it had been buried a long time.
<p/>Mistress Mary stood up and looked at it with an almost frightened face as it hung from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) finger.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it has been buried for ten years,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said in a whisper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it is the key to the garden!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VIII  THE ROBIN WHO SHOWED THE WAY   She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked at the key quite a long time.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned it over and over, and thought about it.
<p/>As I have said before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not a child who had been trained to ask permission or consult her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) elders about things.
<p/>All she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closed garden, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could find out where the door was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could perhaps open it and see what was inside the walls, and what had happened to the old rose-trees.
<p/>It was because it had been shut up so long that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to see it.
<p/>It seemed as if it must be different from other places and that something strange must have happened to it during ten years.
<p/>Besides that, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked it she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could go into it every day and shut the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could make up some play of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own and play it quite alone, because nobody would ever know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was, but would think the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth.
<p/>The thought of that pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) very much.
<p/>Living as it were, all by herself in a house with a hundred mysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever to do to amuse herself, had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) inactive brain to working and was actually awakening her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) imagination.
<p/>There is no doubt that the fresh, strong, pure air from the moor had a great deal to do with it.
<p/>Just as it had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) an appetite, and fighting with the wind had stirred her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) blood, so the same things had stirred her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind.
<p/>In India she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had always been too hot and languid and weak to care much about anything, but in this place she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was beginning to care and to want to do new things.
<p/>Already she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt less <div class="bookquote">``contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know why.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put the key in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pocket and walked up and down her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walk.
<p/>No one but herself ever seemed to come there, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could walk slowly and look at the wall, or, rather, at the ivy growing on it.
<p/>The ivy was the baffling thing.
<p/>Howsoever carefully she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could see nothing but thickly growing, glossy, dark green leaves.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was very much disappointed.
<p/>Something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) contrariness came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) paced the walk and looked over it at the tree-tops inside.
<p/>It seemed so silly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to herself, to be near it and not be able to get in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took the key in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pocket when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went back to the house, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would always carry it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went out, so that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ever should find the hidden door she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would be ready.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock had allowed Martha to sleep all night at the cottage, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was back at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) work in the morning with cheeks redder than ever and in the best of spirits.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I got up at four o'clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>it was pretty on th' moor with th' birds gettin' up an' th' rabbits scamperin' about an' th' sun risin'.
<p/>I didn't walk all th' way.
<p/>A man gave me a ride in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cart an' I did enjoy myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was full of stories of the delights of her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) day out.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) mother had been glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) and they had got the baking and washing all out of the way.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had even made each of the children a doughcake with a bit of brown sugar in it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had 'em all pipin' hot when they came in from playin' on th' moor.
<p/>An' th' cottage all smelt o' nice, clean hot bakin' an' there was a good fire, an' they just shouted for joy.
<p/>Our Dickon he (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said our cottage was good enough for a king.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>In the evening they had all sat round the fire, and Martha and her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) mother had sewed patches on torn clothes and mended stockings and Martha had told them about the little girl who had come from India and who had been waited on all her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) life by what Martha called <div class="bookquote">``blacks''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>until she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) didn't know how to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) own stockings.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>they did like to hear about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They wanted to know all about th' blacks an' about th' ship you came in.
<p/>I couldn't tell 'em enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary reflected a little.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you a great deal more before your next day out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``so that you will have more to talk about.
<p/>I dare say they would like to hear about riding on elephants and camels, and about the officers going to hunt tigers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My word!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>cried delighted Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would set 'em clean off their heads.
<p/>Would tha' really do that, Miss?
<p/>It would be same as a wild beast show like we heard they had in York once.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``India is quite different from Yorkshire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary said slowly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought the matter over.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never thought of that.
<p/>Did Dickon and your mother like to hear you talk about me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, our Dickon's eyes nearly started out o' his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head, they got that round,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>answered Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was put out about your seemin' to be all by yourself like.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, `Hasn't Mr. Craven got no governess for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>), nor no nurse?'
<p/>and I said, `No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) hasn't, though Mrs. Medlock says he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) will when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) thinks of it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) mayn't think of it for two or three years.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want a governess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary sharply.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But mother says you ought to be learnin' your book by this time an' you ought to have a woman to look after you, an' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says: `Now, Martha, you just think how you'd feel yourself, in a big place like that, wanderin' about all alone, an' no mother.
<p/>You do your best to cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up,' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says, an' I said I would.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a long, steady look.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do cheer me up,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like to hear you talk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>Presently Martha went out of the room and came back with something held in her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hands under her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) apron.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does tha' think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, with a cheerful grin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've brought thee a present.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A present!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>exclaimed Mistress Mary.
<p/>How could a cottage full of fourteen hungry people give any one a present!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A man was drivin' across the moor peddlin',''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>Martha explained.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cart at our door.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had pots an' pans an' odds an' ends, but mother had no money to buy anythin'.
<p/>Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was goin' away our `Lizabeth Ellen called out, `Mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s got skippin'-ropes with red an' blue handles.'
<p/>An' mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) calls out quite sudden, `Here, stop, mister!
<p/>How much are they?'
<p/>An' he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says `Tuppence', an' mother she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began fumblin' in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pocket an' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says to me, `Martha, tha's brought me thy wages like a good lass, an' I've got four places to put every penny, but I'm just goin' to take tuppence out of it to buy that child a skippin'-rope,' an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) bought one an' here it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) brought it out from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) apron and exhibited it quite proudly.
<p/>It was a strong, slender rope with a striped red and blue handle at each end, but Mary Lennox had never seen a skipping-rope before.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) gazed at it with a mystified expression.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) asked curiously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>cried out Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does tha' mean that they've not got skippin'-ropes in India, for all they've got elephants and tigers and camels!
<p/>No wonder most of 'em's black.
<p/>This is what it's for; just watch me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) ran into the middle of the room and, taking a handle in each hand, began to skip, and skip, and skip, while Mary turned in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) chair to stare at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and the queer faces in the old portraits seemed to stare at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), too, and wonder what on earth this common little cottager had the impudence to be doing under their very noses.
<p/>But Martha did not even see them.
<p/>The interest and curiosity in Mistress Mary's face delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went on skipping and counted as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) skipped until she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had reached a hundred.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could skip longer than that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stopped.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've skipped as much as five hundred when I was twelve, but I wasn't as fat then as I am now, an' I was in practice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) chair beginning to feel excited herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mother is a kind woman.
<p/>Do you think I could ever skip like that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You just try it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>urged Martha, handing her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) the skipping-rope.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't skip a hundred at first, but if you practice you'll mount up.
<p/>That's what mother said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says, `Nothin' will do her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) more good than skippin' rope.
<p/>It's th' sensiblest toy a child can have.
<p/>Let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) play out in th' fresh air skippin' an' it'll stretch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) legs an' arms an' give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) some strength in 'em.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>It was plain that there was not a great deal of strength in Mistress Mary's arms and legs when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) first began to skip.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not very clever at it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked it so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not want to stop.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put on tha' things and run an' skip out o' doors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother said I must tell you to keep out o' doors as much as you could, even when it rains a bit, so as tha' wrap up warm.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) coat and hat and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) skipping-rope over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arm.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opened the door to go out, and then suddenly thought of something and turned back rather slowly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Martha,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``they were your wages.
<p/>It was your two-pence really.
<p/>Thank you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said it stiffly because she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was not used to thanking people or noticing that they did things for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, and held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hand because she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not know what else to do.
<p/>Martha gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hand a clumsy little shake, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was not accustomed to this sort of thing either.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) laughed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>th' art a queer, old-womanish thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If tha'd been our `Lizabeth Ellen tha'd have given me a kiss.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary looked stiffer than ever.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want me to kiss you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>Martha laughed again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, not me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If tha' was different, p`raps tha'd want to thysel'.
<p/>But tha' isn't.
<p/>Run off outside an' play with thy rope.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>Mistress Mary felt a little awkward as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went out of the room.
<p/>Yorkshire people seemed strange, and Martha was always rather a puzzle to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) very much, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not.
<p/>The skipping-rope was a wonderful thing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) counted and skipped, and skipped and counted, until her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) cheeks were quite red, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was more interested than she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had ever been since she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was born.
<p/>The sun was shining and a little wind was blowing--not a rough wind, but one which came in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent of newly turned earth with it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) skipped round the fountain garden, and up one walk and down another.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) skipped at last into the kitchen-garden and saw Ben Weatherstaff digging and talking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) robin, which was hopping about him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) skipped down the walk toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) head and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) with a curious expression.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) would notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) skip.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) exclaimed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word.
<p/>P'raps tha' art a young `un, after all, an' p`raps tha's got child's blood in thy veins instead of sour buttermilk.
<p/>Tha's skipped red into thy cheeks as sure as my name's Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>I wouldn't have believed tha' could do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never skipped before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm just beginning.
<p/>I can only go up to twenty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' keep on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' shapes well enough at it for a young `un that's lived with heathen.
<p/>Just see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'s watchin' thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>the robin</b></font>)</div>jerking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) head toward the robin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) followed after thee yesterday.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'ll be at it again today.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'ll be bound to find out what th' skippin'-rope is.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'s never seen one.
<p/>Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) head at the bird, <div class="bookquote">``tha' curiosity will be th' death of thee sometime if tha' doesn't look sharp.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard, resting every few minutes.
<p/>At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own special walk and made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind to try if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could skip the whole length of it.
<p/>It was a good long skip and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began slowly, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had gone half-way down the path she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was so hot and breathless that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was obliged to stop.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not mind much, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had already counted up to thirty.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stopped with a little laugh of pleasure, and there, lo and behold, was the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with a chirp.
<p/>As Mary had skipped toward him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt something heavy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pocket strike against her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) at each jump, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw the robin she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) laughed again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You showed me where the key was yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to show me the door today; but I don't believe you know!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The robin</b></font>)</div><p/>The robin flew from his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the wall and he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to show off.
<p/>Nothing in the world is quite as adorably lovely as a robin when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) shows off--and they are nearly always doing it.
<p/>Mary Lennox had heard a great deal about Magic in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) Ayah's stories, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) always said that what happened almost at that moment was Magic.
<p/>One of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the walk, and it was a stronger one than the rest.
<p/>It was strong enough to wave the branches of the trees, and it was more than strong enough to sway the trailing sprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall.
<p/>Mary had stepped close to the robin, and suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivy trails, and more suddenly still she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) jumped toward it and caught it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand.
<p/>This she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had seen something under it--a round knob which had been covered by the leaves hanging over it.
<p/>It was the knob of a door.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands under the leaves and began to pull and push them aside.
<p/>Thick as the ivy hung, it nearly all was a loose and swinging curtain, though some had crept over wood and iron.
<p/>Mary's heart began to thump and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands to shake a little in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) delight and excitement.
<p/>The robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) head on one side, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) were as excited as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was.
<p/>What was this under her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands which was square and made of iron and which her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fingers found a hole in?
<p/>It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put the key in and turned it.
<p/>It took two hands to do it, but it did turn.
<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took a long breath and looked behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) up the long walk to see if any one was coming.
<p/>No one was coming.
<p/>No one ever did come, it seemed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took another long breath, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not help it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened slowly--slowly.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) slipped through it, and shut it behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) back against it, looking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was standing inside the secret garden.
<p/>CHAPTER IX  THE STRANGEST HOUSE ANY ONE EVER LIVED IN   It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine.
<p/>The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted together.
<p/>Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) had seen a great many roses in India.
<p/>All the ground was covered with grass of a wintry brown and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rosebushes if they were alive.
<p/>There were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees.
<p/>There were other trees in the garden, and one of the things which made the place look strangest and loveliest was that climbing roses had run all over them and swung down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains, and here and there they had caught at each other or at a far-reaching branch and had crept from one tree to another and made lovely bridges of themselves.
<p/>There were neither leaves nor roses on them now and Mary did not know whether they were dead or alive, but their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass, where they had fallen from their fastenings and run along the ground.
<p/>It was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious.
<p/>Mary had thought it must be different from other gardens which had not been left all by themselves so long; and indeed it was different from any other place she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had ever seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How still it is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whispered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How still!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) waited a moment and listened at the stillness.
<p/>The robin, who had flown to his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) treetop, was still as all the rest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) did not even flutter his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) wings; he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) sat without stirring, and looked at Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No wonder it is still,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whispered again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were afraid of awakening some one.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was glad that there was grass under her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feet and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) steps made no sounds.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked under one of the fairy-like gray arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils which formed them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if they are all quite dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it all a quite dead garden?
<p/>I wish it wasn't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been Ben Weatherstaff she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could have told whether the wood was alive by looking at it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could only see that there were only gray or brown sprays and branches and none showed any signs of even a tiny leaf-bud anywhere.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was inside the wonderful garden and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could come through the door under the ivy any time and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had found a world all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own.
<p/>The sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch of blue sky over this particular piece of Misselthwaite seemed even more brilliant and soft than it was over the moor.
<p/>The robin flew down from his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) tree-top and hopped about or flew after her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) from one bush to another.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) chirped a good deal and had a very busy air, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) were showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) things.
<p/>Everything was strange and silent and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) seemed to be hundreds of miles away from any one, but somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not feel lonely at all.
<p/>All that troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew whether all the roses were dead, or if perhaps some of them had lived and might put out leaves and buds as the weather got warmer.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not want it to be a quite dead garden.
<p/>If it were a quite alive garden, how wonderful it would be, and what thousands of roses would grow on every side!
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) skipping-rope had hung over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arm when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came in and after she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had walked about for a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would skip round the whole garden, stopping when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to look at things.
<p/>There seemed to have been grass paths here and there, and in one or two corners there were alcoves of evergreen with stone seats or tall moss-covered flower urns in them.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came near the second of these alcoves she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stopped skipping.
<p/>There had once been a flowerbed in it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw something sticking out of the black earth--some sharp little pale green points.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) remembered what Ben Weatherstaff had said and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knelt down to look at them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they are tiny growing things and they might be crocuses or snowdrops or daffodils,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whispered.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh scent of the damp earth.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked it very much.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps there are some other ones coming up in other places,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go all over the garden and look.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not skip, but walked.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went slowly and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes on the ground.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked in the old border beds and among the grass, and after she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had gone round, trying to miss nothing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had found ever so many more sharp, pale green points, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had become quite excited again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't a quite dead garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cried out softly to herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Even if the roses are dead, there are other things alive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know anything about gardening, but the grass seemed so thick in some of the places where the green points were pushing their way through that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought they did not seem to have room enough to grow.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) searched about until she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found a rather sharp piece of wood and knelt down and dug and weeded out the weeds and grass until she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made nice little clear places around them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now they look as if they could breathe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had finished with the first ones.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to do ever so many more.
<p/>I'll do all I can see.
<p/>If I haven't time today I can come tomorrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went from place to place, and dug and weeded, and enjoyed herself so immensely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was led on from bed to bed and into the grass under the trees.
<p/>The exercise made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) so warm that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) first threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) coat off, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hat, and without knowing it she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was smiling down on to the grass and the pale green points all the time.
<p/>The robin was tremendously busy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was very much pleased to see gardening begun on his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) own estate.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had often wondered at Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>Where gardening is done all sorts of delightful things to eat are turned up with the soil.
<p/>Now here was this new kind of creature who was not half Ben's size and yet had had the sense to come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) garden and begin at once.
<p/>Mistress Mary worked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) garden until it was time to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) midday dinner.
<p/>In fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was rather late in remembering, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) coat and hat, and picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) skipping-rope, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been working two or three hours.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been actually happy all the time; and dozens and dozens of the tiny, pale green points were to be seen in cleared places, looking twice as cheerful as they had looked before when the grass and weeds had been smothering them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall come back this afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, looking all round at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) new kingdom, and speaking to the trees and the rose-bushes as if they heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran lightly across the grass, pushed open the slow old door and slipped through it under the ivy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had such red cheeks and such bright eyes and ate such a dinner that Martha was delighted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Two pieces o' meat an' two helps o' rice puddin'!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>mother will be pleased when I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) what th' skippin'-rope's done for thee.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>In the course of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) digging with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pointed stick Mistress Mary had found herself digging up a sort of white root rather like an onion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had put it back in its place and patted the earth carefully down on it and just now she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wondered if Martha could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) what it was.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Martha,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``what are those white roots that look like onions?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're bulbs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>answered Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lots o' spring flowers grow from 'em.
<p/>Th' very little ones are snowdrops an' crocuses an' th' big ones are narcissuses an' jonquils and daffydowndillys.
<p/>Th' biggest of all is lilies an' purple flags.
<p/>Eh!
<p/>they are nice.
<p/>Dickon's got a whole lot of 'em planted in our bit o' garden.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does Dickon know all about them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Mary, a new idea taking possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our Dickon can make a flower grow out of a brick walk.
<p/>Mother says he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) just whispers things out o' th' ground.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do bulbs live a long time?
<p/>Would they live years and years if no one helped them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>inquired Mary anxiously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're things as helps themselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's why poor folk can afford to have 'em.
<p/>If you don't trouble 'em, most of 'em'll work away underground for a lifetime an' spread out an' have little `uns.
<p/>There's a place in th' park woods here where there's snowdrops by thousands.
<p/>They're the prettiest sight in Yorkshire when th' spring comes.
<p/>No one knows when they was first planted.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish the spring was here now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to see all the things that grow in England.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dinner and gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) favorite seat on the hearth-rug.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish--I wish I had a little spade,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever does tha' want a spade for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Martha, laughing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Art tha' goin' to take to diggin'?
<p/>I must tell mother that, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary looked at the fire and pondered a little.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must be careful if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) meant to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) secret kingdom.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wasn't doing any harm, but if Mr. Craven found out about the open door he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) would be fearfully angry and get a new key and lock it up forevermore.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) really could not bear that.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is such a big lonely place,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said slowly, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were turning matters over in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The house is lonely, and the park is lonely, and the gardens are lonely.
<p/>So many places seem shut up.
<p/>I never did many things in India, but there were more people to look at--natives and soldiers marching by--and sometimes bands playing, and my Ayah told me stories.
<p/>There is no one to talk to here except you and Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>And you have to do your work and Ben Weatherstaff won't speak to me often.
<p/>I thought if I had a little spade I could dig somewhere as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) does, and I might make a little garden if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) would give me some seeds.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>Martha's face quite lighted up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``if that wasn't one of th' things mother said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says, `There's such a lot o' room in that big place, why don't they give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a bit for herself, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doesn't plant nothin' but parsley an' radishes?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d dig an' rake away an' be right down happy over it.'
<p/>Them was the very words she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How many things she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knows, doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>said Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's like she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) says: 'A woman as brings up twelve children learns something besides her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) A B C. Children's as good as `rithmetic to set you findin' out things.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much would a spade cost--a little one?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>was Martha's reflective answer, <div class="bookquote">``at Thwaite village there's a shop or so an' I saw little garden sets with a spade an' a rake an' a fork all tied together for two shillings.
<p/>An' they was stout enough to work with, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got more than that in my purse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Morrison gave me five shillings and Mrs. Medlock gave me some money from Mr.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) remember thee that much?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>exclaimed Martha.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' can buy anything in th' world tha' wants.
<p/>Th' rent of our cottage is only one an' threepence an' it's like pullin' eye-teeth to get it.
<p/>Now I've just thought of somethin',''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hips.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary eagerly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the shop at Thwaite they sell packages o' flower-seeds for a penny each, and our Dickon he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) knows which is th' prettiest ones an' how to make 'em grow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) walks over to Thwaite many a day just for th' fun of it.
<p/>Does tha' know how to print letters?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>suddenly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know how to write,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary answered.
<p/>Martha shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our Dickon can only read printin'.
<p/>If tha' could print we could write a letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) an' ask him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) to go an' buy th' garden tools an' th' seeds at th' same time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>you're a good girl!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary cried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are, really!
<p/>I didn't know you were so nice.
<p/>I know I can print letters if I try.
<p/>Let's ask Mrs. Medlock for a pen and ink and some paper.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got some of my own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I bought 'em so I could print a bit of a letter to mother of a Sunday.
<p/>I'll go and get it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) ran out of the room, and Mary stood by the fire and twisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thin little hands together with sheer pleasure.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I have a spade,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``I can make the earth nice and soft and dig up weeds.
<p/>If I have seeds and can make flowers grow the garden won't be dead at all--it will come alive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not go out again that afternoon because when Martha returned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) pen and ink and paper she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was obliged to clear the table and carry the plates and dishes downstairs and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) got into the kitchen Mrs. Medlock was there and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) to do something, so Mary waited for what seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a long time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came back.
<p/>Then it was a serious piece of work to write to Dickon.
<p/>Mary had been taught very little because her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) governesses had disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) too much to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not spell particularly well but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could print letters when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tried.
<p/>This was the letter Martha dictated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>): ``My Dear Dickon:  This comes hoping to find you well as it leaves me at present.
<p/>Miss Mary has plenty of money and will you go to Thwaite and buy her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) some flower seeds and a set of garden tools to make a flower-bed.
<p/>Pick the prettiest ones and easy to grow because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) has never done it before and lived in India which is different.
<p/>Give my love to mother and every one of you.
<p/>Miss Mary is going to tell me a lot more so that on my next day out you can hear about elephants and camels and gentlemen going hunting lions and tigers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your loving sister, Martha Phoebe Sowerby.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How shall I get the things when Dickon buys them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>)'ll bring 'em to you himself.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>exclaimed Mary, <div class="bookquote">``then I shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>)!
<p/>I never thought I should see Dickon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does tha' want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Martha suddenly, for Mary had looked so pleased.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do.
<p/>I never saw a boy foxes and crows loved.
<p/>I want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) very much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>Martha gave a little start, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) remembered something.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now to think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) broke out, <div class="bookquote">``to think o' me forgettin' that there; an' I thought I was goin' to tell you first thing this mornin'.
<p/>I asked mother--and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d ask Mrs. Medlock her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own self.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary began.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I said Tuesday.
<p/>Ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) if you might be driven over to our cottage some day and have a bit o' mother's hot oat cake, an' butter, an' a glass o' milk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed as if all the interesting things were happening in one day.
<p/>To think of going over the moor in the daylight and when the sky was blue!
<p/>To think of going into the cottage which held twelve children!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) think Mrs. Medlock would let me go?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) asked, quite anxiously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) would.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) knows what a tidy woman mother is and how clean she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) keeps the cottage.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I went I should see your mother as well as Dickon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, thinking it over and liking the idea very much.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) doesn't seem to be like the mothers in India.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) work in the garden and the excitement of the afternoon ended by making her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feel quiet and thoughtful.
<p/>Martha stayed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) until tea-time, but they sat in comfortable quiet and talked very little.
<p/>But just before Martha went downstairs for the tea-tray, Mary asked a question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Martha,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``has the scullery-maid had the toothache again today?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Martha certainly started slightly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes thee ask that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because when I waited so long for you to come back I opened the door and walked down the corridor to see if you were coming.
<p/>And I heard that far-off crying again, just as we heard it the other night.
<p/>There isn't a wind today, so you see it couldn't have been the wind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>said Martha restlessly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' mustn't go walkin' about in corridors an' listenin'.
<p/>Mr. Craven would be that there angry there's no knowin' what he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'d do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wasn't listening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was just waiting for you--and I heard it.
<p/>That's three times.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My word!
<p/>There's Mrs. Medlock's bell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) almost ran out of the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the strangest house any one ever lived in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary drowsily, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head on the cushioned seat of the armchair near her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>Fresh air, and digging, and skipping-rope had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feel so comfortably tired that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fell asleep.
<p/>CHAPTER X  DICKON   The sun shone down for nearly a week on the secret garden.
<p/>The Secret Garden was what Mary called it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was thinking of it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked the name, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful old walls shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in no one knew where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was.
<p/>It seemed almost like being shut out of the world in some fairy place.
<p/>The few books she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) had read and liked had been fairy-story books, and she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) had read of secret gardens in some of the stories.
<p/>Sometimes people went to sleep in them for a hundred years, which she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) had thought must be rather stupid.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) had no intention of going to sleep, and, in fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) was becoming wider awake every day which passed at Misselthwaite.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) was beginning to like to be out of doors; she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) no longer hated the wind, but enjoyed it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) could run faster, and longer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) could skip up to a hundred.
<p/>The bulbs in the secret garden must have been much astonished.
<p/>Such nice clear places were made round them that they had all the breathing space they wanted, and really, if Mistress Mary had known it, they began to cheer up under the dark earth and work tremendously.
<p/>The sun could get at them and warm them, and when the rain came down it could reach them at once, so they began to feel very much alive.
<p/>Mary was an odd, determined little person, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had something interesting to be determined about, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was very much absorbed, indeed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming more pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) work every hour instead of tiring of it.
<p/>It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) like a fascinating sort of play.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found many more of the sprouting pale green points than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had ever hoped to find.
<p/>They seemed to be starting up everywhere and each day she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found tiny new ones, some so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth.
<p/>There were so many that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) remembered what Martha had said about the <div class="bookquote">``snowdrops by the thousands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>and about bulbs spreading and making new ones.
<p/>These had been left to themselves for ten years and perhaps they had spread, like the snowdrops, into thousands.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) wondered how long it would be before they showed that they were flowers.
<p/>Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) stopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it would be like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom.
<p/>During that week of sunshine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) became more intimate with Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) several times by seeming to start up beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) sprang out of the earth.
<p/>The truth was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was afraid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) would pick up his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) tools and go away if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) coming, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) always walked toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) as silently as possible.
<p/>But, in fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did not object to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) as strongly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had at first.
<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was secretly rather flattered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) evident desire for his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) elderly company.
<p/>Then, also, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was more civil than she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had been.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did not know that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) would have spoken to a native, and had not known that a cross, sturdy old Yorkshire man was not accustomed to salaam to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) masters, and be merely commanded by them to do things.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha`rt like th' robin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) one morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) head and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) standing by him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never knows when I shall see thee or which side tha'll come from.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'s friends with me now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's like him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>snapped Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Makin' up to th' women folk just for vanity an' flightiness.
<p/>There's nothin' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) wouldn't do for th' sake o' showin' off an' flirtin' his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) tail-feathers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'s as full o' pride as an egg's full o' meat.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) very seldom talked much and sometimes did not even answer Mary's questions except by a grunt, but this morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said more than usual.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) stood up and rested one hobnailed boot on the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) spade while he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) looked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) over.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long has tha' been here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) jerked out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it's about a month,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha's beginnin' to do Misselthwaite credit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha's a bit fatter than tha' was an' tha's not quite so yeller.
<p/>Tha' looked like a young plucked crow when tha' first came into this garden.
<p/>Thinks I to myself I never set eyes on an uglier, sourer faced young `un.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary was not vain and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never thought much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looks she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not greatly disturbed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I'm fatter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My stockings are getting tighter.
<p/>They used to make wrinkles.
<p/>There's the robin, Ben Weatherstaff.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the robin</b></font>)</div><p/>There, indeed, was the robin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) looked nicer than ever.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) flirted his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) wings and tail and tilted his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) head and hopped about with all sorts of lively graces.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) seemed determined to make Ben Weatherstaff admire him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>).
<p/>But Ben was sarcastic.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, there tha' art!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' can put up with me for a bit sometimes when tha's got no one better.
<p/>Tha's been reddenin' up thy waistcoat an' polishin' thy feathers this two weeks.
<p/>I know what tha's up to.
<p/>Tha's courtin' some bold young madam somewhere tellin' thy lies to her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) about bein' th' finest cock robin on Missel Moor an' ready to fight all th' rest of 'em.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>exclaimed Mary.
<p/>The robin was evidently in a fascinating, bold mood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) hopped closer and closer and looked at Ben Weatherstaff more and more engagingly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) flew on to the nearest currant bush and tilted his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) head and sang a little song right at him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' thinks tha'll get over me by doin' that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben, wrinkling his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) face up in such a way that Mary felt sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was trying not to look pleased.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' thinks no one can stand out against thee--that's what tha' thinks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The robin</b></font>)</div><p/>The robin spread his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) wings--Mary could scarcely believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) flew right up to the handle of Ben Weatherstaff's spade and alighted on the top of it.
<p/>Then the old man's face wrinkled itself slowly into a new expression.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood still as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were afraid to breathe--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not have stirred for the world, lest his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) robin should start away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke quite in a whisper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm danged!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said as softly as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were saying something quite different.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' does know how to get at a chap--tha' does!
<p/>Tha's fair unearthly, tha's so knowin'.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) stood without stirring--almost without drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) breath--until the robin gave another flirt to his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) wings and flew away.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) stood looking at the handle of the spade as if there might be Magic in it, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes.
<p/>But because he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) kept breaking into a slow grin now and then, Mary was not afraid to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you a garden of your own?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.
<p/>I'm bachelder an' lodge with Martin at th' gate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you had one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``what would you plant?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cabbages an' `taters an' onions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you wanted to make a flower garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>persisted Mary, <div class="bookquote">``what would you plant?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bulbs an' sweet-smellin' things--but mostly roses.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary's face lighted up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like roses?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff rooted up a weed and threw it aside before he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes, I do.
<p/>I was learned that by a young lady I was gardener to.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a lot in a place she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was fond of, an' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) loved 'em like they was children--or robins.
<p/>I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bend over an' kiss 'em.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) dragged out another weed and scowled at it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That were as much as ten year' ago.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Mary, much interested.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) answered, and drove his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) spade deep into the soil, ''`cording to what parson says.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What happened to the roses?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary asked again, more interested than ever.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They was left to themselves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary was becoming quite excited.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did they quite die?
<p/>Do roses quite die when they are left to themselves?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ventured.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'd got to like 'em--an' I liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)--an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>Ben Weatherstaff admitted reluctantly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Once or twice a year I'd go an' work at 'em a bit--prune 'em an' dig about th' roots.
<p/>They run wild, but they was in rich soil, so some of 'em lived.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you tell whether they are dead or alive?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>inquired Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait till th' spring gets at 'em--wait till th' sun shines on th' rain and th' rain falls on th' sunshine an' then tha'll find out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How--how?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Mary, forgetting to be careful.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look along th' twigs an' branches an' if tha' see a bit of a brown lump swelling here an' there, watch it after th' warm rain an' see what happens.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stopped suddenly and looked curiously at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eager face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why does tha' care so much about roses an' such, all of a sudden?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) demanded.
<p/>Mistress Mary felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face grow red.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was almost afraid to answer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I want to play that--that I have a garden of my own,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stammered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--there is nothing for me to do.
<p/>I have nothing--and no one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben Weatherstaff slowly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that's true.
<p/>Tha' hasn't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said it in such an odd way that Mary wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was actually a little sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never felt sorry for herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had only felt tired and cross, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) disliked people and things so much.
<p/>But now the world seemed to be changing and getting nicer.
<p/>If no one found out about the secret garden, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should enjoy herself always.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stayed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) as many questions as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dared.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) answered every one of them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) queer grunting way and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did not seem really cross and did not pick up his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) spade and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said something about roses just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was going away and it reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) of the ones he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had been fond of.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you go and see those other roses now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not been this year.
<p/>My rheumatics has made me too stiff in th' joints.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) grumbling voice, and then quite suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) seemed to get angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not see why he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) should.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now look here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said sharply.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tha' ask so many questions.
<p/>Tha`rt th' worst wench for askin' questions I've ever come a cross.
<p/>Get thee gone an' play thee.
<p/>I've done talkin' for today.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said it so crossly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew there was not the least use in staying another minute.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went skipping slowly down the outside walk, thinking him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) over and saying to herself that, queer as it was, here was another person whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) crossness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked old Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did like him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) always wanted to try to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>Also she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) knew everything in the world about flowers.
<p/>There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and ended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would slip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were any rabbits hopping about.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) enjoyed the skipping very much and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) reached the little gate she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opened it and went through because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it was.
<p/>It was a very strange thing indeed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) quite caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breath as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stopped to look at it.
<p/>A boy was sitting under a tree, with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back against it, playing on a rough wooden pipe.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a funny looking boy about twelve.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked very clean and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nose turned up and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such round and such blue eyes in any boy's face.
<p/>And on the trunk of the tree he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) leaned against, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) neck to peep out, and quite near him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were two rabbits sitting up and sniffing with tremulous noses--and actually it appeared as if they were all drawing near to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and listen to the strange low little call his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pipe seemed to make.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw Mary he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) held up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand and spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in a voice almost as low as and rather like his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) piping.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tha' move,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It'd flight 'em.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary remained motionless.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stopped playing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pipe and began to rise from the ground.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were moving at all, but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) feet and then the squirrel scampered back up into the branches of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tree, the pheasant withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop away, though not at all as if they were frightened.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm Dickon,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the boy said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know tha`rt Miss Mary.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mary realized that somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had known at first that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was Dickon.
<p/>Who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the natives charm snakes in India?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had a wide, red, curving mouth and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) smile spread all over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as if they had never seen each other before but as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) quite well.
<p/>Mary knew nothing about boys and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a little stiffly because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt rather shy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you get Martha's letter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) asked.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) curly, rust-colored head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's why I come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the ground beside him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) piped.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got th' garden tools.
<p/>There's a little spade an' rake an' a fork an' hoe.
<p/>Eh!
<p/>they are good `uns.
<p/>There's a trowel, too.
<p/>An' th' woman in th' shop threw in a packet o' white poppy an' one o' blue larkspur when I bought th' other seeds.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you show the seeds to me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could talk as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) speech was so quick and easy.
<p/>It sounded as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and was not the least afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not like him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was only a common moor boy, in patched clothes and with a funny face and a rough, rusty-red head.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) noticed that there was a clean fresh scent of heather and grass and leaves about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were made of them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked it very much and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) funny face with the red cheeks and round blue eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) forgot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had felt shy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us sit down on this log and look at them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>They sat down and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took a clumsy little brown paper package out of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) coat pocket.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) untied the string and inside there were ever so many neater and smaller packages with a picture of a flower on each one.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a lot o' mignonette an' poppies,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's that robin as is callin' us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/>The chirp came from a thick holly bush, bright with scarlet berries, and Mary thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew whose it was.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it really calling us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked.

<p/>I wants a bit of a chat.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knows thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>said Dickon in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) low voice again.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) moved quite close to the bush with the slow movement Mary had noticed before, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) made a sound almost like the robin's own twitter.
<p/>The robin listened a few seconds, intently, and then answered quite as if he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) were replying to a question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'s a friend o' yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>chuckled Dickon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) is?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Mary eagerly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did so want to know.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And it really seemed as if it must be true.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) so sidled and twittered and tilted as he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) hopped on his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) bush.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you understand everything birds say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary.
<p/>Dickon's grin spread until he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) seemed all wide, red, curving mouth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) rough head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I do, and they think I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) said.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) laughed and came back to the log and began to talk about the flower seeds again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) what they looked like when they were flowers; he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) how to plant them, and watch them, and feed and water them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``See here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) said suddenly, turning round to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary's thin hands clutched each other as they lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lap.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know what to say, so for a whole minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said nothing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never thought of this.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt miserable.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went red and then pale.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha's got a bit o' garden, hasn't tha'?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon said.
<p/>It was true that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had turned red and then pale.
<p/>Dickon saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) do it, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) still said nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to be puzzled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't they give thee a bit?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hasn't tha' got any yet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands tighter and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know anything about boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said slowly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Could you keep a secret, if I told you one?
<p/>It's a great secret.
<p/>I don't know what I should do if any one found it out.
<p/>I believe I should die!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said the last sentence quite fiercely.
<p/>Dickon looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) rough head again, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered quite good-humoredly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm keepin' secrets all th' time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I couldn't keep secrets from th' other lads, secrets about foxes' cubs, an' birds' nests, an' wild things' holes, there'd be naught safe on th' moor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've stolen a garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said very fast.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't mine.
<p/>It isn't anybody's.
<p/>Nobody wants it, nobody cares for it, nobody ever goes into it.
<p/>Perhaps everything is dead in it already.

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to feel hot and as contrary as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had ever felt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life.

<p/>Dickon's curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh-h-h!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) exclamation out slowly, and the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did it meant both wonder and sympathy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've nothing to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing belongs to me.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Dickon in a dropped voice.
<p/>Mistress Mary got up from the log at once.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt contrary again, and obstinate, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not care at all.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was imperious and Indian, and at the same time hot and sorrowful.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come with me and I'll show you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) round the laurel path and to the walk where the ivy grew so thickly.
<p/>Dickon followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with a queer, almost pitying, look on his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) were being led to look at some strange bird's nest and must move softly.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stepped to the wall and lifted the hanging ivy he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) started.
<p/>There was a door and Mary pushed it slowly open and they passed in together, and then Mary stood and waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand round defiantly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a secret garden, and I'm the only one in the world who wants it to be alive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon looked round and round about it, and round and round again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) almost whispered, <div class="bookquote">``it is a queer, pretty place!
<p/>It's like as if a body was in a dream.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XI  THE NEST OF THE MISSEL THRUSH   For two or three minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) stood looking round him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>), while Mary watched him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) began to walk about softly, even more lightly than Mary had walked the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had found herself inside the four walls.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) eyes seemed to be taking in everything--the gray trees with the gray creepers climbing over them and hanging from their branches, the tangle on the walls and among the grass, the evergreen alcoves with the stone seats and tall flower urns standing in them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never thought I'd see this place,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said at last, in a whisper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you know about it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Mary.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had spoken aloud and he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) made a sign to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must talk low,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``or some one'll hear us an' wonder what's to do in here.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you know about the garden?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked again when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had recovered herself.
<p/>Dickon nodded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Martha told me there was one as no one ever went inside,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Us used to wonder what it was like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) stopped and looked round at the lovely gray tangle about him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) round eyes looked queerly happy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will there be roses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) stepped over to the nearest tree--an old, old one with gray lichen all over its bark, but upholding a curtain of tangled sprays and branches.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) took a thick knife out of his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) Pocket and opened one of its blades.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's lots o' dead wood as ought to be cut out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said.

<p/>Mary touched it herself in an eager, reverent way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That one?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that one quite alive quite?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's as wick as you or me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said; and Mary remembered that Martha had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that <div class="bookquote">``wick''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>meant <div class="bookquote">``alive''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``lively.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad it's wick!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cried out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whisper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want them all to be wick.

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) quite panted with eagerness, and Dickon was as eager as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was.
<p/>They went from tree to tree and from bush to bush.
<p/>Dickon carried his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) hand and showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) things which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought wonderful.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They've run wild,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but th' strongest ones has fair thrived on it.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) pulled down a thick gray, dry-looking branch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A body might think this was dead wood, but I don't believe it is--down to th' root.
<p/>I'll cut it low down an' see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) knelt and with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) knife cut the lifeless-looking branch through, not far above the earth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''

<p/>In the course of half an hour Mary thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could tell too, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) cut through a lifeless-looking branch she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would cry out joyfully under her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breath when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) caught sight of the least shade of moist green.
<p/>The spade, and hoe, and fork were very useful.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) how to use the fork while he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) dug about roots with the spade and stirred the earth and let the air in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) cried, pointing to the grass a few feet away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who did that there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>It was one of Mary's own little clearings round the pale green points.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I thought tha' didn't know nothin' about gardenin',''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) exclaimed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``but they were so little, and the grass was so thick and strong, and they looked as if they had no room to breathe.
<p/>So I made a place for them.
<p/>I don't even know what they are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon went and knelt down by them, smiling his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) wide smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' was right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A gardener couldn't have told thee better.
<p/>They'll grow now like Jack's bean-stalk.
<p/>They're crocuses an' snowdrops, an' these here is narcissuses,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>turning to another patch, <div class="bookquote">``an here's daffydowndillys.
<p/>Eh!
<p/>they will be a sight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) ran from one clearing to another.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' has done a lot o' work for such a little wench,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, looking her (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) over.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm growing fatter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``and I'm growing stronger.
<p/>I used always to be tired.
<p/>When I dig I'm not tired at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's naught as nice as th' smell o' good clean earth, except th' smell o' fresh growin' things when th' rain falls on 'em.
<p/>I get out on th' moor many a day when it's rainin' an' I lie under a bush an' listen to th' soft swish o' drops on th' heather an' I just sniff an' sniff.
<p/>My nose end fair quivers like a rabbit's, mother says.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you never catch cold?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>inquired Mary, gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>'em</b></font>) wonderingly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never seen such a funny boy, or such a nice one.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, grinning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never ketched cold since I was born.
<p/>I wasn't brought up nesh enough.
<p/>I've chased about th' moor in all weathers same as th' rabbits does.
<p/>Mother says I've sniffed up too much fresh air for twelve year' to ever get to sniffin' with cold.
<p/>I'm as tough as a white-thorn knobstick.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was working all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was talking and Mary was following him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and helping him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fork or the trowel.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a lot of work to do here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said once, looking about quite exultantly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come again and help me to do it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary begged.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I can help, too.
<p/>I can dig and pull up weeds, and do whatever you tell me.
<p/>Oh!

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll come every day if tha' wants me, rain or shine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) answered stoutly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the best fun I ever had in my life--shut in here an' wakenin' up a garden.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``if you will help me to make it alive I'll--I don't know what I'll do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ended helplessly.
<p/>What could you do for a boy like that?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell thee what tha'll do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>said Dickon, with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) happy grin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha'll get fat an' tha'll get as hungry as a young fox an' tha'll learn how to talk to th' robin same as I do.
<p/>Eh!
<p/>we'll have a lot o' fun.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) began to walk about, looking up in the trees and at the walls and bushes with a thoughtful expression.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't want to make it look like a gardener's garden, all clipped an' spick an' span, would you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's nicer like this with things runnin' wild, an' swingin' an' catchin' hold of each other.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let us make it tidy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary anxiously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't seem like a secret garden if it was tidy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon stood rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) rusty-red head with a rather puzzled look.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a secret garden sure enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but seems like some one besides th' robin must have been in it since it was shut up ten year' ago.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the door was locked and the key was buried,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one could get in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a queer place.
<p/>Seems to me as if there'd been a bit o' prunin' done here an' there, later than ten year' ago.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how could it have been done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) was examining a branch of a standard rose and he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye!
<p/>how could it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) murmured.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``With th' door locked an' th' key buried.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>Mistress Mary always felt that however many years she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lived she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should never forget that first morning when her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) garden began to grow.
<p/>Of course, it did seem to begin to grow for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that morning.
<p/>When Dickon began to clear places to plant seeds, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) remembered what Basil had sung at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) wanted to tease her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are there any flowers that look like bells?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) inquired.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lilies o' th' valley does,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) answered, digging away with the trowel, <div class="bookquote">``an' there's Canterbury bells, an' campanulas.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's plant some,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's lilies o' th, valley here already; I saw 'em.
<p/>They'll have growed too close an' we'll have to separate 'em, but there's plenty.
<p/>Th' other ones takes two years to bloom from seed, but I can bring you some bits o' plants from our cottage garden.
<p/>Why does tha' want 'em?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mary told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) about Basil and his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) brothers and sisters in India and of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had hated them and of their calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Mistress Mary Quite Contrary.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They used to dance round and sing at me.
<p/>They sang--  `Mistress Mary, quite contrary, How does your garden grow?
<p/>With silver bells, and cockle shells, And marigolds all in a row.'
<p/>I just remembered it and it made me wonder if there were really flowers like silver bells.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) frowned a little and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) trowel a rather spiteful dig into the earth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wasn't as contrary as they were.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>But Dickon laughed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) said, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) crumbled the rich black soil she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) was sniffing up the scent of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There doesn't seem to be no need for no one to be contrary when there's flowers an' such like, an' such lots o' friendly wild things runnin' about makin' homes for themselves, or buildin' nests an' singin' an' whistlin', does there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary, kneeling by him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) holding the seeds, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) and stopped frowning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dickon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you are as nice as Martha said you were.
<p/>I like you, and you make the fifth person.
<p/>I never thought I should like five people.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon sat up on his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) heels as Martha did when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was polishing the grate.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) did look funny and delightful, Mary thought, with his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) round blue eyes and red cheeks and happy looking turned-up nose.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only five folk as tha' likes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is th' other four?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mother and Martha,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary checked them off on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fingers, <div class="bookquote">``and the robin and Ben Weatherstaff.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon laughed so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was obliged to stifle the sound by putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) arm over his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) mouth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know tha' thinks I'm a queer lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but I think tha' art th' queerest little lass I ever saw.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mary did a strange thing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) leaned forward and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) a question she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never dreamed of asking any one before.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tried to ask it in Yorkshire because that was his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) language, and in India a native was always pleased if you knew his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) speech.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does tha' like me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) answered heartily, <div class="bookquote">``that I does.
<p/>I likes thee wonderful, an' so does th' robin, I do believe!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's two, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's two for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And then they began to work harder than ever and more joyfully.
<p/>Mary was startled and sorry when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard the big clock in the courtyard strike the hour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) midday dinner.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall have to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said mournfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will have to go too, won't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon grinned.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dinner's easy to carry about with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother always lets me put a bit o' somethin' in my pocket.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) coat from the grass and brought out of a pocket a lumpy little bundle tied up in a quite clean, coarse, blue and white handkerchief.
<p/>It held two thick pieces of bread with a slice of something laid between them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's oftenest naught but bread,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but I've got a fine slice o' fat bacon with it today.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary thought it looked a queer dinner, but he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) seemed ready to enjoy it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Run on an' get thy victuals,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be done with mine first.
<p/>I'll get some more work done before I start back home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) sat down with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) back against a tree.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll call th' robin up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and give him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) th' rind o' th' bacon to peck at.
<p/>They likes a bit o' fat wonderful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary could scarcely bear to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>).
<p/>Suddenly it seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) might be a sort of wood fairy who might be gone when she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) came into the garden again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) seemed too good to be true.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) went slowly half-way to the door in the wall and then she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) stopped and went back.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever happens, you--you never would tell?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) said.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) poppy-colored cheeks were distended with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) first big bite of bread and bacon, but he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) managed to smile encouragingly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If tha' was a missel thrush an' showed me where thy nest was, does tha' think I'd tell any one?
<p/>Not me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' art as safe as a missel thrush.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) was quite sure she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) was.
<p/>CHAPTER XII  <div class="bookquote">``MIGHT I HAVE A BIT OF EARTH?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary ran so fast that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was rather out of breath when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) room.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hair was ruffled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) forehead and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cheeks were bright pink.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dinner was waiting on the table, and Martha was waiting near it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha's a bit late,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary in a determined voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s th' best lad as ever was born, but us never thought he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was handsome.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary was afraid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might begin to ask difficult questions, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why!
<p/>Why!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) didn't want to see me when I came.
<p/>I heard Pitcher say he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) didn't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>explained Martha, <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Medlock says it's because o' mother.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was walkin' to Thwaite village an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>)'d never spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) before, but Mrs. Craven had been to our cottage two or three times.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>)'d forgot, but mother hadn't an' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made bold to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>).
<p/>I don't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) about you but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said somethin' as put him (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) in th' mind to see you before he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) goes away again, tomorrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>)'s always doin' it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>I'm so glad--so glad!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary thankfully.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) did not come back until winter, or even autumn, there would be time to watch the secret garden come alive.
<p/>Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) found out then and took it away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would have had that much at least.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) will want to see--''   (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not finish the sentence, because the door opened, and Mrs. Medlock walked in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had on her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) best black dress and cap, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) collar was fastened with a large brooch with a picture of a man's face on it.
<p/>It was a colored photograph of Mr. Medlock who had died years ago, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) always wore it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was dressed up.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) looked nervous and excited.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your hair's rough,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said quickly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and brush it.
<p/>Martha, help her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) to slip on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) best dress.
<p/>Mr. Craven sent me to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) study.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>All the pink left Mary's cheeks.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart began to thump and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt herself changing into a stiff, plain, silent child again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not even answer Mrs. Medlock, but turned and walked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) bedroom, followed by Martha.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said nothing while her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) dress was changed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hair brushed, and after she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was quite tidy she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) followed Mrs. Medlock down the corridors, in silence.
<p/>What was there for her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) to say?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was obliged to go and see Mr. Craven and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) would not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) would not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) would think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was taken to a part of the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had not been into before.
<p/>At last Mrs. Medlock knocked at a door, and when some one said, <div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>they entered the room together.
<p/>A man was sitting in an armchair before the fire, and Mrs. Medlock spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Miss Mary, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can go and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) here.
<p/>I will ring for you when I want you to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Craven/Mr. Archibald Craven/Archibald Craven</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Craven.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went out and closed the door, Mary could only stand waiting, a plain little thing, twisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thin hands together.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could see that the man in the chair was not so much a hunchback as a man with high, rather crooked shoulders, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had black hair streaked with white.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) high shoulders and spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/>Mary went to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not ugly.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face would have been handsome if it had not been so miserable.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked as if the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) worried and fretted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not know what in the world to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do they take good care of you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead fretfully as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) over.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very thin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am getting fatter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary answered in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stiffest way.
<p/>What an unhappy face he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had!
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) black eyes seemed as if they scarcely saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), as if they were seeing something else, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hardly keep his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgot you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How could I remember you?
<p/>I intended to send you a governess or a nurse, or some one of that sort, but I forgot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>began Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please--''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and then the lump in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) throat choked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want to say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inquired.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am--I am too big for a nurse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And please--please don't make me have a governess yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead again and stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was what the Sowerby woman said,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered absentmindedly.
<p/>Then Mary gathered a scrap of courage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)--is she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Martha's mother?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stammered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knows about children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) has twelve.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knows.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to rouse himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want to do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to play out of doors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary answered, hoping that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) voice did not tremble.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never liked it in India.
<p/>It makes me hungry here, and I am getting fatter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Sowerby said it would do you good.
<p/>Perhaps it will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) thought you had better get stronger before you had a governess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It makes me feel strong when I play and the wind comes over the moor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>argued Mary.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked next.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>gasped Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Martha's mother sent me a skipping-rope.
<p/>I skip and run--and I look about to see if things are beginning to stick up out of the earth.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't look so frightened,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said in a worried voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You could not do any harm, a child like you!
<p/>You may do what you like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) throat because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might see the excited lump which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt jump into it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came a step nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said tremulously.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) anxious little face seemed to worry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more than ever.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't look so frightened,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/>I sent for you to-day because Mrs. Sowerby said I ought to see you.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) daughter had talked about you.

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>as if a sudden thought had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).

<p/>Mr. Craven looked quite startled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Earth!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) repeated.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To plant seeds in--to make things grow--to see them come alive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary faltered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you--care about gardens so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said slowly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know about them in India,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was always ill and tired and it was too hot.
<p/>I sometimes made little beds in the sand and stuck flowers in them.
<p/>But here it is different.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Craven/Mr. Archibald Craven/Archibald Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Craven got up and began to walk slowly across the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A bit of earth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said to himself, and Mary thought that somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must have reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) of something.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) stopped and spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) dark eyes looked almost soft and kind.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can have as much earth as you want,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You remind me of some one else who loved the earth and things that grow.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I take it from anywhere--if it's not wanted?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) touched the bell to call Mrs. Medlock.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-by.
<p/>I shall be away all summer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Medlock came so quickly that Mary thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must have been waiting in the corridor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Medlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Craven/Mr. Archibald Craven/Archibald Craven</b></font>)</div>Mr. Craven said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``now I have seen the child I understand what Mrs. Sowerby meant.

<p/>Don't look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) too much.

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Medlock looked pleased.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a tiresome charge and had indeed seen as little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dared.
<p/>In addition to this she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was fond of Martha's mother.

<p/>Miss Mary can get no harm from them.
<p/>I'd always take Susan Sowerby's advice about children myself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found Martha waiting there.
<p/>Martha had, in fact, hurried back after she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had removed the dinner service.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can have my garden!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran as quickly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could to the garden.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been away so much longer than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew Dickon would have to set out early on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) five-mile walk.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) slipped through the door under the ivy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) was not working where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>).
<p/>The gardening tools were laid together under a tree.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran to them, looking all round the place, but there was no Dickon to be seen.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) had gone away and the secret garden was empty--except for the robin who had just flown across the wall and sat on a standard rose-bush watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'s gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said woefully.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Something white fastened to the standard rose-bush caught her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) eye.
<p/>It was a piece of paper, in fact, it was a piece of the letter she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) had printed for Martha to send to Dickon.
<p/>It was fastened on the bush with a long thorn, and in a minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) knew Dickon had left it there.
<p/>There were some roughly printed letters on it and a sort of picture.
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) could not tell what it was.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) saw it was meant for a nest with a bird sitting on it.
<p/>Underneath were the printed letters and they said:  <div class="bookquote">``I will cum bak.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIII  <div class="bookquote">``I AM COLIN''    (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary took the picture back to the house when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) supper and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) showed it to Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>said Martha with great pride.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never knew our Dickon was as clever as that.
<p/>That there's a picture of a missel thrush on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) nest, as large as life an' twice as natural.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mary knew Dickon had meant the picture to be a message.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had meant that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) secret.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) garden was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) nest and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was like a missel thrush.
<p/>Oh, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did like that queer, common boy!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would come back the very next day and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fell asleep looking forward to the morning.
<p/>But you never know what the weather will do in Yorkshire, particularly in the springtime.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was awakened in the night by the sound of rain beating with heavy drops against her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) window.
<p/>It was pouring down in torrents and the wind was <div class="bookquote">``wuthering''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>round the corners and in the chimneys of the huge old house.
<p/>Mary sat up in bed and felt miserable and angry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The rain is as contrary as I ever was,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It came because it knew I did not want it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) threw herself back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pillow and buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not cry, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lay and hated the sound of the heavily beating rain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hated the wind and its <div class="bookquote">``wuthering.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not go to sleep again.
<p/>The mournful sound kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) awake because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt mournful herself.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had felt happy it would probably have lulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to sleep.
<p/>How it <div class="bookquote">``wuthered''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and how the big raindrops poured down and beat against the pane!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It sounds just like a person lost on the moor and wandering on and on crying,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been lying awake turning from side to side for about an hour, when suddenly something made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sit up in bed and turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head toward the door listening.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) listened and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) listened.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't the wind now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said in a loud whisper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That isn't the wind.
<p/>It is different.
<p/>It is that crying I heard before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) room was ajar and the sound came down the corridor, a far-off faint sound of fretful crying.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) listened for a few minutes and each minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) became more and more sure.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must find out what it was.
<p/>It seemed even stranger than the secret garden and the buried key.
<p/>Perhaps the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was in a rebellious mood made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bold.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) foot out of bed and stood on the floor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to find out what it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody is in bed and I don't care about Mrs. Medlock--I don't care!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a candle by her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) bedside and she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) took it up and went softly out of the room.
<p/>The corridor looked very long and dark, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was too excited to mind that.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) remembered the corners she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) must turn to find the short corridor with the door covered with tapestry--the one Mrs. Medlock had come through the day she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) lost herself.
<p/>The sound had come up that passage.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) dim light, almost feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) way, her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) heart beating so loud that she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) could hear it.
<p/>The far-off faint crying went on and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>).
<p/>Sometimes it stopped for a moment or so and then began again.
<p/>Was this the right corner to turn?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) stopped and thought.
<p/>Yes it was.
<p/>Down this passage and then to the left, and then up two broad steps, and then to the right again.
<p/>Yes, there was the tapestry door.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) pushed it open very gently and closed it behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) stood in the corridor and could hear the crying quite plainly, though it was not loud.
<p/>It was on the other side of the wall at her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) left and a few yards farther on there was a door.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) could see a glimmer of light coming from beneath it.
<p/>The Someone was crying in that room, and it was quite a young Someone.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) walked to the door and pushed it open, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was standing in the room!
<p/>It was a big room with ancient, handsome furniture in it.
<p/>There was a low fire glowing faintly on the hearth and a night light burning by the side of a carved four-posted bed hung with brocade, and on the bed was lying a boy, crying fretfully.
<p/>Mary wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was in a real place or if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had fallen asleep again and was dreaming without knowing it.
<p/>The boy had a sharp, delicate face the color of ivory and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seemed to have eyes too big for it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had also a lot of hair which tumbled over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forehead in heavy locks and made his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thin face seem smaller.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked like a boy who had been ill, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was crying more as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were tired and cross than as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were in pain.
<p/>Mary stood near the door with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) candle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breath.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) crept across the room, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) drew nearer, the light attracted the boy's attention and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pillow and stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gray eyes opening so wide that they seemed immense.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said at last in a half-frightened whisper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you a ghost?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary answered, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own whisper sounding half frightened.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you one?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stared and stared and stared.
<p/>Mary could not help noticing what strange eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had.
<p/>They were agate gray and they looked too big for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face because they had black lashes all round them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) replied after waiting a moment or so.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am Colin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is Colin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) faltered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am Colin Craven.
<p/>Who are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am Mary Lennox.
<p/>Mr. Craven is my uncle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) is my father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>gasped Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one ever told me he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had a boy!
<p/>Why didn't they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, still keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) strange eyes fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with an anxious expression.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came close to the bed and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand and touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are real, aren't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have such real dreams very often.
<p/>You might be one of them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary had slipped on a woolen wrapper before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) room and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put a piece of it between his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fingers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rub that and see how thick and warm it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will pinch you a little if you like, to show you how real I am.
<p/>For a minute I thought you might be a dream too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did you come from?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``From my own room.
<p/>The wind wuthered so I couldn't go to sleep and I heard some one crying and wanted to find out who it was.
<p/>What were you crying for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I couldn't go to sleep either and my head ached.
<p/>Tell me your name again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary Lennox.
<p/>Did no one ever tell you I had come to live here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was still fingering the fold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) wrapper, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began to look a little more as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) believed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) reality.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They daren't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I should have been afraid you would see me.
<p/>I won't let people see me and talk me over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary asked again, feeling more mystified every moment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I am like this always, ill and having to lie down.
<p/>My father won't let people talk me over either.
<p/>The servants are not allowed to speak about me.
<p/>If I live I may be a hunchback, but I shan't live.
<p/>My father hates to think I may be like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what a queer house this is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a queer house!
<p/>Everything is a kind of secret.
<p/>Rooms are locked up and gardens are locked up--and you!
<p/>Have you been locked up?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.
<p/>I stay in this room because I don't want to be moved out of it.
<p/>It tires me too much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does your father come and see you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary ventured.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes.
<p/>Generally when I am asleep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doesn't want to see me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary could not help asking again.
<p/>A sort of angry shadow passed over the boy's face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother died when I was born and it makes him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wretched to look at me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thinks I don't know, but I've heard people talking.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) almost hates me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hates the garden, because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary half speaking to herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What garden?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>the boy asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>just--just a garden she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) used to like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary stammered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been here always?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nearly always.
<p/>Sometimes I have been taken to places at the seaside, but I won't stay because people stare at me.
<p/>I used to wear an iron thing to keep my back straight, but a grand doctor came from London to see me and said it was stupid.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) told them to take it off and keep me out in the fresh air.
<p/>I hate fresh air and I don't want to go out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't when first I came here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you keep looking at me like that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because of the dreams that are so real,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) answered rather fretfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes when I open my eyes I don't believe I'm awake.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We're both awake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) glanced round the room with its high ceiling and shadowy corners and dim fire-light.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks quite like a dream, and it's the middle of the night, and everybody in the house is asleep--everybody but us.
<p/>We are wide awake.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want it to be a dream,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the boy said restlessly.
<p/>Mary thought of something all at once.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't like people to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``do you want me to go away?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) still held the fold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wrapper and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gave it a little pull.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be sure you were a dream if you went.
<p/>If you are real, sit down on that big footstool and talk.
<p/>I want to hear about you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) candle on the table near the bed and sat down on the cushioned stool.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not want to go away at all.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to stay in the mysterious hidden-away room and talk to the mysterious boy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want me to tell you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wanted to know how long she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been at Misselthwaite; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wanted to know which corridor her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) room was on; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wanted to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been doing; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) disliked the moor as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) disliked it; where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had lived before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came to Yorkshire.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered all these questions and many more and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lay back on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pillow and listened.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tell him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a great deal about India and about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) voyage across the ocean.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found out that because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been an invalid he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had not learned things as other children had.
<p/>One of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nurses had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to read when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was quite little and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was always reading and looking at pictures in splendid books.
<p/>Though his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father rarely saw him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was awake, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was given all sorts of wonderful things to amuse himself with.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) never seemed to have been amused, however.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could have anything he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked for and was never made to do anything he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did not like to do.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everyone is obliged to do what pleases me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said indifferently.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It makes me ill to be angry.
<p/>No one believes I shall live to grow up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said it as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was so accustomed to the idea that it had ceased to matter to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) at all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seemed to like the sound of Mary's voice.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went on talking he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) listened in a drowsy, interested way.
<p/>Once or twice she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were not gradually falling into a doze.
<p/>But at last he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked a question which opened up a new subject.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How old are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ten,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary, forgetting herself for the moment, <div class="bookquote">``and so are you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) demanded in a surprised voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because when you were born the garden door was locked and the key was buried.
<p/>And it has been locked for ten years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin half sat up, turning toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) elbows.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What garden door was locked?
<p/>Who did it?
<p/>Where was the key buried?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) exclaimed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) were suddenly very much interested.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It--it was the garden Mr. Craven hates,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary nervously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) locked the door.
<p/>No one--no one knew where he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) buried the key.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of a garden is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin persisted eagerly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one has been allowed to go into it for ten years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>was Mary's careful answer.
<p/>But it was too late to be careful.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was too much like herself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) too had had nothing to think about and the idea of a hidden garden attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) as it had attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) asked question after question.
<p/>Where was it?
<p/>Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) never looked for the door?
<p/>Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) never asked the gardeners?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They won't talk about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think they have been told not to answer questions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would make them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Could you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary faltered, beginning to feel frightened.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could make people answer questions, who knew what might happen!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everyone is obliged to please me.
<p/>I told you that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were to live, this place would sometime belong to me.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thought that the whole world belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>How peculiar he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was and how coolly he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spoke of not living.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think you won't live?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked, partly because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was curious and partly in hope of making him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forget the garden.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) dropped back on his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) pillow and lay there with an odd expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) face.

<p/>And then--if the doctor wants you to go out in your chair, and if you can always do what you want to do, perhaps--perhaps we might find some boy who would push you, and we could go alone and it would always be a secret garden.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should--like--that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said very slowly, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes looking dreamy.

<p/>I should not mind fresh air in a secret garden.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary began to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breath and feel safer because the idea of keeping the secret seemed to please him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt almost sure that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) kept on talking and could make him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) see the garden in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mind as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had seen it he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would like it so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could not bear to think that everybody might tramp in to it when they chose.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what I think it would be like, if we could go into it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been shut up so long things have grown into a tangle perhaps.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lay quite still and listened while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went on talking about the roses which might have clambered from tree to tree and hung down--about the many birds which might have built their nests there because it was so safe.
<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) about the robin and Ben Weatherstaff, and there was so much to tell about the robin and it was so easy and safe to talk about it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ceased to be afraid.
<p/>The robin pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) smiled until he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) looked almost beautiful, and at first Mary had thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was even plainer than herself, with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) big eyes and heavy locks of hair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know birds could be like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you stay in a room you never see things.
<p/>What a lot of things you know.
<p/>I feel as if you had been inside that garden.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know what to say, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not say anything.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) evidently did not expect an answer and the next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a surprise.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to let you look at something,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you see that rose-colored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the mantel-piece?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary had not noticed it before, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked up and saw it.
<p/>It was a curtain of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a cord hanging from it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and pull it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary got up, much mystified, and found the cord.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pulled it the silk curtain ran back on rings and when it ran back it uncovered a picture.
<p/>It was the picture of a girl with a laughing face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had bright hair tied up with a blue ribbon and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gay, lovely eyes were exactly like Colin's unhappy ones, agate gray and looking twice as big as they really were because of the black lashes all round them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin complainingly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) died.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary did as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was told and returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) footstool.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is much prettier than you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes are just like yours--at least they are the same shape and color.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) moved uncomfortably.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I made them do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I don't like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looking at me.

 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lay thinking a few minutes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had done before, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) spoke again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you shall be a secret, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not tell them until they find out.

<p/>Martha shall tell you when to come here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mary understood Martha's troubled look when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had asked questions about the crying.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like that perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said drowsily.
<p/>Somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and did not want him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to lie awake, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) leaned against the bed and began to stroke and pat his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand and sing a very low little chanting song in Hindustani.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said more drowsily still, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went on chanting and stroking, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) again his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) black lashes were lying close against his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cheeks, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes were shut and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was fast asleep.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) got up softly, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) candle and crept away without making a sound.
<p/>CHAPTER XIV  A YOUNG RAJAH   The moor was hidden in mist when the morning came, and the rain had not stopped pouring down.

<p/>There was a bright fire on the hearth when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) room, and in the daylight she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw it was a very beautiful room indeed.
<p/>There were rich colors in the rugs and hangings and pictures and books on the walls which made it look glowing and comfortable even in spite of the gray sky and falling rain.
<p/>Colin looked rather like a picture himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was wrapped in a velvet dressing-gown and sat against a big brocaded cushion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I've heard it ever since I remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered crossly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are always whispering about it and thinking I don't notice.
<p/>They wish I would, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>Mistress Mary felt quite contrary.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pinched her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lips together.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If they wished I would,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't.
<p/>Who wishes you would?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The servants--and of course Dr. Craven because he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) would get Misselthwaite and be rich instead of poor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) daren't say so, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) always looks cheerful when I am worse.
<p/>When I had typhoid fever his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) face got quite fat.
<p/>I think my father wishes it, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary quite obstinately.
<p/>That made Colin turn and look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lay back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cushion and was still, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) were thinking.
<p/>And there was quite a long silence.
<p/>Perhaps they were both of them thinking strange things children do not usually think.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like the grand doctor from London, because he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) made them take the iron thing off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary at last <div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) say you were going to die?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knew I hated whispering.
<p/>I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) say one thing quite aloud.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, `The lad might live if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mind to it.
<p/>Put him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) in the humor.'
<p/>It sounded as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was in a temper.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you who would put you in the humor, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary reflecting.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would like this thing to be settled one way or the other.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe Dickon would.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s always talking about live things.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) never talks about dead things or things that are ill.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s always looking up in the sky to watch birds flying--or looking down at the earth to see something growing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) has such round blue eyes and they are so wide open with looking about.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) laughs such a big laugh with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wide mouth--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cheeks are as red--as red as cherries.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) stool nearer to the sofa and her (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) expression quite changed at the remembrance of the wide curving mouth and wide open eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``See here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let us talk about dying; I don't like it.
<p/>Let us talk about living.
<p/>Let us talk and talk about Dickon.
<p/>And then we will look at your pictures.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the best thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could have said.
<p/>To talk about Dickon meant to talk about the moor and about the cottage and the fourteen people who lived in it on sixteen shillings a week--and the children who got fat on the moor grass like the wild ponies.
<p/>And about Dickon's mother--and the skipping-rope--and the moor with the sun on it--and about pale green points sticking up out of the black sod.
<p/>And it was all so alive that Mary talked more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had ever talked before--and Colin both talked and listened as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had never done either before.
<p/>And they both began to laugh over nothings as children will when they are happy together.
<p/>And they laughed so that in the end they were making as much noise as if they had been two ordinary healthy natural ten-year-old creatures--instead of a hard, little, unloving girl and a sickly boy who believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was going to die.
<p/>They enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot the pictures and they forgot about the time.
<p/>They had been laughing quite loudly over Ben Weatherstaff and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) robin, and Colin was actually sitting up as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had forgotten about his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) weak back, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) suddenly remembered something.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know there is one thing we have never once thought of,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are cousins.''
 (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed so queer that they had talked so much and never remembered this simple thing that they laughed more than ever, because they had got into the humor to laugh at anything.
<p/>And in the midst of the fun the door opened and in walked Dr. Craven and Mrs. Medlock.
<p/>Dr. Craven started in actual alarm and Mrs. Medlock almost fell back because he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had accidentally bumped against her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Lord!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div><p/>exclaimed poor Mrs. Medlock with her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) eyes almost starting out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Lord!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dr. Craven, coming forward.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mary was reminded of the boy Rajah again.
<p/>Colin answered as if neither the doctor's alarm nor Mrs. Medlock's terror were of the slightest consequence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was as little disturbed or frightened as if an elderly cat and dog had walked into the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is my cousin, Mary Lennox,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) to come and talk to me.
<p/>I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) must come and talk to me whenever I send for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Craven turned reproachfully to Mrs. Medlock.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) panted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how it's happened.
<p/>There's not a servant on the place tha'd dare to talk--they all have their orders.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody told her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) heard me crying and found me herself.
<p/>I am glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) came.
<p/>Don't be silly, Medlock.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary saw that Dr. Craven did not look pleased, but it was quite plain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) dare not oppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) patient.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) sat down by Colin and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pulse.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid there has been too much excitement.
<p/>Excitement is not good for you, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be excited if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) kept away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>answered Colin, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes beginning to look dangerously sparkling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am better.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) makes me better.
<p/>The nurse must bring up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tea with mine.
<p/>We will have tea together.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Medlock and Dr. Craven looked at each other in a troubled way, but there was evidently nothing to be done.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) does look rather better, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>ventured Mrs. Medlock.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--thinking the matter over--<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) looked better this morning before she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) came into the room.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) came into the room last night.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) stayed with me a long time.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) sang a Hindustani song to me and it made me go to sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was better when I wakened up.
<p/>I wanted my breakfast.
<p/>I want my tea now.
<p/>Tell nurse, Medlock.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Craven did not stay very long.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) talked to the nurse for a few minutes when she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) came into the room and said a few words of warning to Colin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) must not talk too much; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) must not forget that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was ill; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) must not forget that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was very easily tired.
<p/>Mary thought that there seemed to be a number of uncomfortable things he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was not to forget.
<p/>Colin looked fretful and kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) strange black-lashed eyes fixed on Dr. Craven's face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to forget it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said at last.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) makes me forget it.
<p/>That is why I want her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Craven did not look happy when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) left the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) gave a puzzled glance at the little girl sitting on the large stool.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had become a stiff, silent child again as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) entered and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) could not see what the attraction was.
<p/>The boy actually did look brighter, however--and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sighed rather heavily as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went down the corridor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are always wanting me to eat things when I don't want to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin, as the nurse brought in the tea and put it on the table by the sofa.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, if you'll eat I will.
<p/>Those muffins look so nice and hot.
<p/>Tell me about Rajahs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>XV</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XV  NEST BUILDING   After another week of rain the high arch of blue sky appeared again and the sun which poured down was quite hot.
<p/>Though there had been no chance to see either the secret garden or Dickon, Mistress Mary had enjoyed herself very much.
<p/>The week had not seemed long.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had spent hours of every day with Colin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) room, talking about Rajahs or gardens or Dickon and the cottage on the moor.
<p/>They had looked at the splendid books and pictures and sometimes Mary had read things to Colin, and sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had read a little to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was amused and interested she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) scarcely looked like an invalid at all, except that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face was so colorless and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was always on the sofa.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a sly young one to listen and get out of your bed to go following things up like you did that night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Medlock said once.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But there's no saying it's not been a sort of blessing to the lot of us.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s not had a tantrum or a whining fit since you made friends.
<p/>The nurse was just going to give up the case because she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was so sick of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) doesn't mind staying now you've gone on duty with her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>laughing a little.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) talks with Colin, Mary had tried to be very cautious about the secret garden.
<p/>There were certain things she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to find out from him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must find them out without asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) direct questions.
<p/>In the first place, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to like to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to discover whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was the kind of boy you could tell a secret to.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was not in the least like Dickon, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was evidently so pleased with the idea of a garden no one knew anything about that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could be trusted.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not known him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) long enough to be sure.
<p/>The second thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to find out was this: If he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could be trusted--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) really could--wouldn't it be possible to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) to the garden without having any one find it out?
<p/>The grand doctor had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) must have fresh air and Colin had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would not mind fresh air in a secret garden.
<p/>Perhaps if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had a great deal of fresh air and knew Dickon and the robin and saw things growing he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) might not think so much about dying.
<p/>Mary had seen herself in the glass sometimes lately when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had realized that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked quite a different creature from the child she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had seen when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arrived from India.
<p/>This child looked nicer.
<p/>Even Martha had seen a change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Th' air from th' moor has done thee good already,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha`rt not nigh so yeller and tha`rt not nigh so scrawny.
<p/>Even tha' hair doesn't slamp down on tha' head so flat.
<p/>It's got some life in it so as it sticks out a bit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's like me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's growing stronger and fatter.
<p/>I'm sure there's more of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks it, for sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha, ruffling it up a little round her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha`rt not half so ugly when it's that way an' there's a bit o' red in tha' cheeks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin</b></font>)</div><p/>If gardens and fresh air had been good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) perhaps they would be good for Colin.
<p/>But then, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hated people to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would not like to see Dickon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why does it make you angry when you are looked at?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) inquired one day.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always hated it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``even when I was very little.
<p/>Then when they took me to the seaside and I used to lie in my carriage everybody used to stare and ladies would stop and talk to my nurse and then they would begin to whisper and I knew then they were saying I shouldn't live to grow up.
<p/>Then sometimes the ladies would pat my cheeks and say `Poor child!'
<p/>Once when a lady did that I screamed out loud and bit her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so frightened she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ran away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought you had gone mad like a dog,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, not at all admiringly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin, frowning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder why you didn't scream and bite me when I came into your room?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to smile slowly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were a ghost or a dream,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't bite a ghost or a dream, and if you scream they don't care.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you hate it if--if a boy looked at you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary asked uncertainly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lay back on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cushion and paused thoughtfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's one boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said quite slowly, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were thinking over every word, <div class="bookquote">``there's one boy I believe I shouldn't mind.
<p/>It's that boy who knows where the foxes live--Dickon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you wouldn't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The birds don't and other animals,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, still thinking it over, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps that's why I shouldn't.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s a sort of animal charmer and I am a boy animal.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) laughed and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) laughed too; in fact it ended in their both laughing a great deal and finding the idea of a boy animal hiding in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hole very funny indeed.
<p/>What Mary felt afterward was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) need not fear about Dickon.
<p/>On that first morning when the sky was blue again Mary wakened very early.
<p/>The sun was pouring in slanting rays through the blinds and there was something so joyous in the sight of it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) jumped out of bed and ran to the window.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) drew up the blinds and opened the window itself and a great waft of fresh, scented air blew in upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>The moor was blue and the whole world looked as if something Magic had happened to it.
<p/>There were tender little fluting sounds here and there and everywhere, as if scores of birds were beginning to tune up for a concert.
<p/>Mary put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand out of the window and held it in the sun.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's warm--warm!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will make the green points push up and up and up, and it will make the bulbs and roots work and struggle with all their might under the earth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) kneeled down and leaned out of the window as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could, breathing big breaths and sniffing the air until she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) laughed because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) remembered what Dickon's mother had said about the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) nose quivering like a rabbit's.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be very early,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The little clouds are all pink and I've never seen the sky look like this.
<p/>No one is up.
<p/>I don't even hear the stable boys.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A sudden thought made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) scramble to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't wait!
<p/>I am going to see the garden!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had learned to dress herself by this time and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) clothes in five minutes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew a small side door which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could unbolt herself and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) flew downstairs in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stocking feet and put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) shoes in the hall.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) unchained and unbolted and unlocked and when the door was open she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sprang across the step with one bound, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was standing on the grass, which seemed to have turned green, and with the sun pouring down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and warm sweet wafts about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and the fluting and twittering and singing coming from every bush and tree.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands for pure joy and looked up in the sky and it was so blue and pink and pearly and white and flooded with springtime light that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must flute and sing aloud herself and knew that thrushes and robins and skylarks could not possibly help it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran around the shrubs and paths towards the secret garden.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all different already,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The grass is greener and things are sticking up everywhere and things are uncurling and green buds of leaves are showing.
<p/>This afternoon I am sure Dickon will come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The long warm rain had done strange things to the herbaceous beds which bordered the walk by the lower wall.
<p/>There were things sprouting and pushing out from the roots of clumps of plants and there were actually here and there glimpses of royal purple and yellow unfurling among the stems of crocuses.
<p/>Six months before Mistress Mary would not have seen how the world was waking up, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) missed nothing.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had reached the place where the door hid itself under the ivy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was startled by a curious loud sound.
<p/>It was the caw--caw of a crow and it came from the top of the wall, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked up, there sat a big glossy-plumaged blue-black bird, looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) very wisely indeed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never seen a crow so close before and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a little nervous, but the next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spread his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wings and flapped away across the garden.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not going to stay inside and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pushed the door open wondering if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) got fairly into the garden she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) probably did intend to stay because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had alighted on a dwarf apple-tree and under the apple-tree was lying a little reddish animal with a Bushy tail, and both of them were watching the stooping body and rust-red head of Dickon, who was kneeling on the grass working hard.
<p/>Mary flew across the grass to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Dickon!
<p/>Dickon!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cried out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How could you get here so early!
<p/>How could you!
<p/>The sun has only just got up!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) got up himself, laughing and glowing, and tousled; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes like a bit of the sky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was up long before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>How could I have stayed abed!
<p/>Th' world's all fair begun again this mornin', it has.
<p/>An' it's workin' an' hummin' an' scratchin' an' pipin' an' nest-buildin' an' breathin' out scents, till you've got to be out on it `stead o' lyin' on your back.
<p/>When th' sun did jump up, th' moor went mad for joy, an' I was in the midst of th' heather, an' I run like mad myself, shoutin' an' singin'.
<p/>An' I come straight here.
<p/>I couldn't have stayed away.
<p/>Why, th' garden was lyin' here waitin'!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) chest, panting, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been running herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Dickon!
<p/>Dickon!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so happy I can scarcely breathe!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) talking to a stranger, the little bushy-tailed animal rose from its place under the tree and came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and the rook, cawing once, flew down from its branch and settled quietly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is th' little fox cub,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, rubbing the little reddish animal's head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's named Captain.
<p/>An' this here's Soot.
<p/>Soot he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) flew across th' moor with me an' Captain he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) run same as if th' hounds had been after him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).
<p/>They both felt same as I did.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the creatures</b></font>)</div><p/>Neither of the creatures looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) were the least afraid of Mary.
<p/>When Dickon began to walk about, Soot stayed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) shoulder and Captain trotted quietly close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) side.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``See here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dickon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``See how these has pushed up, an' these an' these!
<p/>An' Eh!
<p/>Look at these here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) threw himself upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) knees and Mary went down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).
<p/>They had come upon a whole clump of crocuses burst into purple and orange and gold.
<p/>Mary bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face down and kissed and kissed them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You never kiss a person in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Flowers are so different.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) looked puzzled but smiled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I've kissed mother many a time that way when I come in from th' moor after a day's roamin' an' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood there at th' door in th' sun, lookin' so glad an' comfortable.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They ran from one part of the garden to another and found so many wonders that they were obliged to remind themselves that they must whisper or speak low.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) swelling leafbuds on rose branches which had seemed dead.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ten thousand new green points pushing through the mould.
<p/>They put their eager young noses close to the earth and sniffed its warmed springtime breathing; they dug and pulled and laughed low with rapture until Mistress Mary's hair was as tumbled as Dickon's and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cheeks were almost as poppy red as his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).
<p/>There was every joy on earth in the secret garden that morning, and in the midst of them came a delight more delightful than all, because it was more wonderful.
<p/>Swiftly something flew across the wall and darted through the trees to a close grown corner, a little flare of red-breasted bird with something hanging from its beak.
<p/>Dickon stood quite still and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hand on Mary almost as if they had suddenly found themselves laughing in a church.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We munnot stir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) whispered in broad Yorkshire.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We munnot scarce breathe.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'s buildin' his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) nest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'ll stay here if us don't fight him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They settled down softly upon the grass and sat there without moving.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Us mustn't seem as if us was watchin' him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) too close,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>said Dickon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'d be out with us for good if he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) got th' notion us was interferin' now.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'s settin' up housekeepin'.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'ll be shyer an' readier to take things ill.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'s got no time for visitin' an' gossipin'.

<p/>Then when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'s got used to seein' us I'll chirp a bit an' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'ll know us'll not be in his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>Mistress Mary was not at all sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew, as Dickon seemed to, how to try to look like grass and trees and bushes.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had said the queer thing as if it were the simplest and most natural thing in the world, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt it must be quite easy to him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>), and indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) for a few minutes carefully, wondering if it was possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) to quietly turn green and put out branches and leaves.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) only sat wonderfully still, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) spoke dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) voice to such a softness that it was curious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's part o' th' springtime, this nest-buildin' is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I warrant it's been goin' on in th' same way every year since th' world was begun.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--do you know about Colin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whispered.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does tha' know about him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ben Weatherstaff scolds him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) and makes fun of him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) hops about and looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) understood every word, and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) likes it.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff says he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) is so conceited he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) would rather have stones thrown at him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) than not be noticed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon laughed too and went on talking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' knows us won't trouble thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said to the robin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Us is near bein' wild things ourselves.
<p/>Us is nest-buildin' too, bless thee.
<p/>Look out tha' doesn't tell on us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the robin</b></font>)</div><p/>And though the robin did not answer, because his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) beak was occupied, Mary knew that when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) flew away with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) twig to his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) own corner of the garden the darkness of his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) dew-bright eye meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) would not tell their secret for the world.
<p/>CHAPTER XVI  <div class="bookquote">``I WON'T!''
 (<font color='red'><b>MARY</b></font>)</div><p/>SAID MARY   They found a great deal to do that morning and Mary was late in returning to the house and was also in such a hurry to get back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) work that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) quite forgot Colin until the last moment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell Colin that I can't come and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very busy in the garden.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>Martha looked rather frightened.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>Miss Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it may put him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) all out of humor when I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mary was not as afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) as other people were and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not a self-sacrificing person.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dickon's waiting for me;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran away.
<p/>The afternoon was even lovelier and busier than the morning had been.
<p/>Already nearly all the weeds were cleared out of the garden and most of the roses and trees had been pruned or dug about.
<p/>Dickon had brought a spade of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) own and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had taught Mary to use all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tools, so that by this time it was plain that though the lovely wild place was not likely to become a <div class="bookquote">``gardener's garden''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>it would be a wilderness of growing things before the springtime was over.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There'll be apple blossoms an' cherry blossoms overhead,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>Dickon said, working away with all his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) might.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' there'll be peach an' plum trees in bloom against th' walls, an' th' grass'll be a carpet o' flowers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The fox rook</b></font>)</div><p/>The little fox and the rook were as happy and busy as they were, and the robin and his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) mate flew backward and forward like tiny streaks of lightning.
<p/>Sometimes the rook flapped his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) black wings and soared away over the tree-tops in the park.
<p/>Each time he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) came back and perched near Dickon and cawed several times as if he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) were relating his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) adventures, and Dickon talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) just as he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had talked to the robin.
<p/>Once when Dickon was so busy that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) did not answer him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) at first, Soot flew on to his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) shoulders and gently tweaked his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) ear with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) large beak.
<p/>When Mary wanted to rest a little Dickon sat down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) under a tree and once he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) pipe out of his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) pocket and played the soft strange little notes and two squirrels appeared on the wall and looked and listened.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha's a good bit stronger than tha' was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>Dickon said, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was digging.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha's beginning to look different, for sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary was glowing with exercise and good spirits.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm getting fatter and fatter every day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said quite exultantly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Medlock will have to get me some bigger dresses.
<p/>Martha says my hair is growing thicker.
<p/>It isn't so flat and stringy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The sun was beginning to set and sending deep gold-colored rays slanting under the trees when they parted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll be fine tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>said Dickon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be at work by sunrise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So will I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran back to the house as quickly as her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feet would carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to tell Colin about Dickon's fox cub and the rook and about what the springtime had been doing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would like to hear.
<p/>So it was not very pleasant when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opened the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) room, to see Martha standing waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) with a doleful face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did Colin say when you told him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) I couldn't come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>said Martha, <div class="bookquote">``I wish tha'd gone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was nigh goin' into one o' his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tantrums.
<p/>There's been a nice to do all afternoon to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) quiet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would watch the clock all th' time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary's lips pinched themselves together.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was no more used to considering other people than Colin was and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw no reason why an ill-tempered boy should interfere with the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked best.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew nothing about the pitifulness of people who had been ill and nervous and who did not know that they could control their tempers and need not make other people ill and nervous, too.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had had a headache in India she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) best to see that everybody else also had a headache or something quite as bad.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was quite right; but of course now she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt that Colin was quite wrong.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was not on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sofa when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was lying flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) back in bed and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came in.
<p/>This was a bad beginning and Mary marched up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stiff manner.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you get up?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did get up this morning when I thought you were coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered, without looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I made them put me back in bed this afternoon.
<p/>My back ached and my head ached and I was tired.
<p/>Why didn't you come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was working in the garden with Dickon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/>Colin frowned and condescended to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't let that boy come here if you go and stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) instead of coming to talk to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/>Mary flew into a fine passion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could fly into a passion without making a noise.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) just grew sour and obstinate and did not care what happened.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you send Dickon away, I'll never come into this room again!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) retorted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have to if I want you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll make you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They shall drag you in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall they, Mr.
<p/>Rajah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary fiercely.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They may drag me in but they can't make me talk when they get me here.
<p/>I'll sit and clench my teeth and never tell you one thing.
<p/>I won't even look at you.
<p/>I'll stare at the floor!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were a nice agreeable pair as they glared at each other.
<p/>If they had been two little street boys they would have sprung at each other and had a rough-and-tumble fight.
<p/>As it was, they did the next thing to it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a selfish thing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Selfish people always say that.
<p/>Any one is selfish who doesn't do what they want.
<p/>You're more selfish than I am.
<p/>You're the most selfish boy I ever saw.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>snapped Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not as selfish as your fine Dickon is!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) keeps you playing in the dirt when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knows I am all by myself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s selfish, if you like!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary's eyes flashed fire.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s nicer than any other boy that ever lived!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s--he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s like an angel!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It might sound rather silly to say that but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not care.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A nice angel!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin sneered ferociously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s a common cottage boy off the moor!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s better than a common Rajah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>retorted Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s a thousand times better!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was the stronger of the two she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was beginning to get the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>The truth was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had never had a fight with any one like himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) life and, upon the whole, it was rather good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), though neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) nor Mary knew anything about that.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pillow and shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes and a big tear was squeezed out and ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cheek.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was beginning to feel pathetic and sorry for himself--not for any one else.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not as selfish as you, because I'm always ill, and I'm sure there is a lump coming on my back,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am going to die besides.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>contradicted Mary unsympathetically.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes quite wide with indignation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had never heard such a thing said before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was at once furious and slightly pleased, if a person could be both at one time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am!
<p/>You know I am!
<p/>Everybody says so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary sourly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You just say that to make people sorry.
<p/>I believe you're proud of it.
<p/>I don't believe it!
<p/>If you were a nice boy it might be true--but you're too nasty!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) invalid back Colin sat up in bed in quite a healthy rage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get out of the room!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) shouted and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) caught hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pillow and threw it at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was not strong enough to throw it far and it only fell at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feet, but Mary's face looked as pinched as a nutcracker.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I won't come back!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked to the door and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) reached it she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned round and spoke again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was going to tell you all sorts of nice things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dickon brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) fox and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) rook and I was going to tell you all about them.
<p/>Now I won't tell you a single thing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) marched out of the door and closed it behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and there to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) great astonishment she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found the trained nurse standing as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been listening and, more amazing still--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was laughing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a big handsome young woman who ought not to have been a trained nurse at all, as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) could not bear invalids and she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was always making excuses to leave Colin to Martha or any one else who would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) place.
<p/>Mary had never liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) simply stood and gazed up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stood giggling into her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) handkerchief..  <div class="bookquote">``What are you laughing at?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At you two young ones,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>said the nurse.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the best thing that could happen to the sickly pampered thing to have some one to stand up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) that's as spoiled as himself;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) laughed into her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) handkerchief again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'d had a young vixen of a sister to fight with it would have been the saving of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) going to die?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know and I don't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>said the nurse.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hysterics and temper are half what ails him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are hysterics?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll find out if you work him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) into a tantrum after this--but at any rate you've given him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) something to have hysterics about, and I'm glad of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) room not feeling at all as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had felt when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had come in from the garden.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was cross and disappointed but not at all sorry for Colin.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had looked forward to telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) a great many things and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had meant to try to make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind whether it would be safe to trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) with the great secret.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been beginning to think it would be, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind entirely.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would never tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could stay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) room and never get any fresh air and die if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) liked!
<p/>It would serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) right!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt so sour and unrelenting that for a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) almost forgot about Dickon and the green veil creeping over the world and the soft wind blowing down from the moor.
<p/>Martha was waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) and the trouble in her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) face had been temporarily replaced by interest and curiosity.
<p/>There was a wooden box on the table and its cover had been removed and revealed that it was full of neat packages.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Craven sent it to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks as if it had picture-books in it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary remembered what he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) the day she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want anything--dolls--toys--books?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opened the package wondering if he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had sent a doll, and also wondering what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should do with it if he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had not sent one.
<p/>There were several beautiful books such as Colin had, and two of them were about gardens and were full of pictures.
<p/>There were two or three games and there was a beautiful little writing-case with a gold monogram on it and a gold pen and inkstand.
<p/>Everything was so nice that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pleasure began to crowd her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) anger out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) to remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) at all and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hard little heart grew quite warm.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can write better than I can print,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and the first thing I shall write with that pen will be a letter to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) I am much obliged.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been friends with Colin she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would have run to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) presents at once, and they would have looked at the pictures and read some of the gardening books and perhaps tried playing the games, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would have enjoyed himself so much he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would never once have thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was going to die or have put his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) spine to see if there was a lump coming.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had a way of doing that which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not bear.
<p/>It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) an uncomfortable frightened feeling because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) always looked so frightened himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) felt even quite a little lump some day he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) should know his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hunch had begun to grow.
<p/>Something he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had heard Mrs. Medlock whispering to the nurse had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) the idea and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had thought over it in secret until it was quite firmly fixed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mind.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock had said his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) father's back had begun to show its crookedness in that way when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was a child.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had never told any one but Mary that most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``tantrums''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>as they called them grew out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hysterical hidden fear.
<p/>Mary had been sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) always began to think about it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was cross or tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) has been cross today.
<p/>Perhaps--perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) has been thinking about it all afternoon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stood still, looking down at the carpet and thinking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I said I would never go back again--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hesitated, knitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brows--<div class="bookquote">``but perhaps, just perhaps, I will go and see--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wants me--in the morning.
<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'ll try to throw his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pillow at me again, but--I think--I'll go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XVII  A TANTRUM   She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had got up very early in the morning and had worked hard in the garden and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was tired and sleepy, so as soon as Martha had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) supper and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had eaten it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was glad to go to bed.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) head on the pillow she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) murmured to herself:  <div class="bookquote">``I'll go out before breakfast and work with Dickon and then afterward--I believe--I'll go to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) thought it was the middle of the night when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was awakened by such dreadful sounds that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) jumped out of bed in an instant.
<p/>What was it--what was it?
<p/>The next minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) felt quite sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) knew.
<p/>Doors were opened and shut and there were hurrying feet in the corridors and some one was crying and screaming at the same time, screaming and crying in a horrible way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Colin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s having one of those tantrums the nurse called hysterics.
<p/>How awful it sounds.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) listened to the sobbing screams she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not wonder that people were so frightened that they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) own way in everything rather than hear them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) ears and felt sick and shivering.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what to do.
<p/>I don't know what to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) kept saying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't bear it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would stop if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) dared go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) remembered how he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had driven her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) out of the room and thought that perhaps the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) might make him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) worse.
<p/>Even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hands more tightly over her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) ears she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) could not keep the awful sounds out.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hated them so and was so terrified by them that suddenly they began to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) angry and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) should like to fly into a tantrum herself and frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was frightening her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was not used to any one's tempers but her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) own.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hands from her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) ears and sprang up and stamped her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) foot.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) ought to be stopped!
<p/>Somebody ought to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) stop!
<p/>Somebody ought to beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) cried out.
<p/>Just then she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) heard feet almost running down the corridor and her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) door opened and the nurse came in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was not laughing now by any means.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) even looked rather pale.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s worked himself into hysterics,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said in a great hurry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'ll do himself harm.
<p/>No one can do anything with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>You come and try, like a good child.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) likes you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) turned me out of the room this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) foot with excitement.
<p/>The stamp rather pleased the nurse.
<p/>The truth was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might find Mary crying and hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head under the bed-clothes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're in the right humor.
<p/>You go and scold him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) something new to think of.
<p/>Do go, child, as quick as ever you can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not until afterward that Mary realized that the thing had been funny as well as dreadful--that it was funny that all the grown-up people were so frightened that they came to a little girl just because they guessed she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was almost as bad as Colin himself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flew along the corridor and the nearer she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) got to the screams the higher her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) temper mounted.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt quite wicked by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) reached the door.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) slapped it open with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand and ran across the room to the four-posted bed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You stop!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) almost shouted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You stop!
<p/>I hate you!
<p/>Everybody hates you!
<p/>I wish everybody would run out of the house and let you scream yourself to death!
<p/>You will scream yourself to death in a minute, and I wish you would!''
 (<font color='red'><b>A child</b></font>)</div><p/>A nice sympathetic child could neither have thought nor said such things, but it just happened that the shock of hearing them was the best possible thing for this hysterical boy whom no one had ever dared to restrain or contradict.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face beating his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pillow with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) actually almost jumped around, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turned so quickly at the sound of the furious little voice.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face looked dreadful, white and red and swollen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was gasping and choking; but savage little Mary did not care an atom.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you scream another scream,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll scream too--and I can scream louder than you can and I'll frighten you, I'll frighten you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) actually had stopped screaming because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had startled him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) so.
<p/>The scream which had been coming almost choked him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>The tears were streaming down his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shook all over.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't stop!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gasped and sobbed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't--I can't!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>shouted Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Half that ails you is hysterics and temper--just hysterics--hysterics--hysterics!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stamped each time she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I felt the lump--I felt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>choked out Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew I should.
<p/>I shall have a hunch on my back and then I shall die,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) began to writhe again and turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face and sobbed and wailed but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) didn't scream.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't feel a lump!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>contradicted Mary fiercely.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you did it was only a hysterical lump.
<p/>Hysterics makes lumps.
<p/>There's nothing the matter with your horrid back--nothing but hysterics!
<p/>Turn over and let me look at it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked the word <div class="bookquote">``hysterics''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and felt somehow as if it had an effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was probably like herself and had never heard it before.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nurse,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) commanded, <div class="bookquote">``come here and show me his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) back this minute!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The nurse, Mrs. Medlock and Martha had been standing huddled together near the door staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>), their mouths half open.
<p/>All three had gasped with fright more than once.
<p/>The nurse came forward as if she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) were half afraid.
<p/>Colin was heaving with great breathless sobs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) won't let me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) hesitated in a low voice.
<p/>Colin heard her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>), however, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) gasped out between two sobs:  <div class="bookquote">``Sh-show her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)!
<p/>She-she'll see then!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a poor thin back to look at when it was bared.
<p/>Every rib could be counted and every joint of the spine, though Mistress Mary did not count them as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bent over and examined them with a solemn savage little face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked so sour and old-fashioned that the nurse turned her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) head aside to hide the twitching of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>There was just a minute's silence, for even Colin tried to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) breath while Mary looked up and down his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) spine, and down and up, as intently as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been the great doctor from London.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's not a single lump there!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said at last.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's not a lump as big as a pin--except backbone lumps, and you can only feel them because you're thin.
<p/>I've got backbone lumps myself, and they used to stick out as much as yours do, until I began to get fatter, and I am not fat enough yet to hide them.
<p/>There's not a lump as big as a pin!
<p/>If you ever say there is again, I shall laugh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>No one but Colin himself knew what effect those crossly spoken childish words had on him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had ever had any one to talk to about his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) secret terrors--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had ever dared to let himself ask questions--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had had childish companions and had not lain on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) back in the huge closed house, breathing an atmosphere heavy with the fears of people who were most of them ignorant and tired of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would have found out that most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) fright and illness was created by himself.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had lain and thought of himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) aches and weariness for hours and days and months and years.
<p/>And now that an angry unsympathetic little girl insisted obstinately that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was not as ill as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) actually felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might be speaking the truth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>ventured the nurse, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had a lump on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) spine.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) back is weak because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) won't try to sit up.
<p/>I could have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) there was no lump there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin gulped and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face a little to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``C-could you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said pathetically.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gulped too.
<p/>Colin turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face again and but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) long-drawn broken breaths, which were the dying down of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) storm of sobbing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lay still for a minute, though great tears streamed down his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face and wet the pillow.
<p/>Actually the tears meant that a curious great relief had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) turned and looked at the nurse again and strangely enough he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was not like a Rajah at all as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think--I could--live to grow up?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/>The nurse was neither clever nor soft-hearted but she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) could repeat some of the London doctor's words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You probably will if you will do what you are told to do and not give way to your temper, and stay out a great deal in the fresh air.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin's tantrum had passed and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was weak and worn out with crying and this perhaps made him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feel gentle.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand a little toward Mary, and I am glad to say that, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own tantum having passed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was softened too and met him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) half-way with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand, so that it was a sort of making up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll--I'll go out with you, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't hate fresh air if we can find--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) remembered just in time to stop himself from saying <div class="bookquote">``if we can find the secret garden''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) ended, <div class="bookquote">``I shall like to go out with you if Dickon will come and push my chair.
<p/>I do so want to see Dickon and the fox and the crow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The nurse remade the tumbled bed and shook and straightened the pillows.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) made Colin a cup of beef tea and gave a cup to Mary, who really was very glad to get it after her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) excitement.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock and Martha gladly slipped away, and after everything was neat and calm and in order the nurse looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) would very gladly slip away also.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was a healthy young woman who resented being robbed of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) sleep and she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) yawned quite openly as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) looked at Mary, who had pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) big footstool close to the four-posted bed and was holding Colin's hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must go back and get your sleep out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'ll drop off after a while--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s not too upset.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered.

<p/>CHAPTER XVIII  <div class="bookquote">``THA' MUNNOT WASTE NO TIME''    (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Of course Mary did not waken early the next morning.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) slept late because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was tired, and when Martha brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) that though.
<p/>Colin was quite quiet he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was ill and feverish as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) always was after he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had worn himself out with a fit of crying.
<p/>Mary ate her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breakfast slowly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) listened.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hat on when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) appeared in Colin's room and for a second he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked disappointed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was in bed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face was pitifully white and there were dark circles round his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you came,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My head aches and I ache all over because I'm so tired.
<p/>Are you going somewhere?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary went and leaned against his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) bed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't be long,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to Dickon, but I'll come back.
<p/>Colin, it's--it's something about the garden.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) whole face brightened and a little color came into it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dreamed about it all night I heard you say something about gray changing into green, and I dreamed I was standing in a place all filled with trembling little green leaves--and there were birds on nests everywhere and they looked so soft and still.
<p/>I'll lie and think about it until you come back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>In five minutes Mary was with Dickon in their garden.
<p/>The fox and the crow were with him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) again and this time he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) had brought two tame squirrels.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came over on the pony this mornin',''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) is a good little chap--Jump is!
<p/>I brought these two in my pockets.
<p/>This here one he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>)'s called Nut an' this here other one's called Shell.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``Nut''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>one squirrel leaped on to his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) right shoulder and when he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``Shell''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the other one leaped on to his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) left shoulder.
<p/>When they sat down on the grass with Captain curled at their feet, Soot solemnly listening on a tree and Nut and Shell nosing about close to them, it seemed to Mary that it would be scarcely bearable to leave such delightfulness, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) story somehow the look in Dickon's funny face gradually changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could see he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) felt sorrier for Colin than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked up at the sky and all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just listen to them birds--th' world seems full of 'em--all whistlin' an' pipin',''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.

<p/>An' we munnot lose no time about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was very much interested he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) often spoke quite broad Yorkshire though at other times he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tried to modify his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) dialect so that Mary could better understand.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) broad Yorkshire and had in fact been trying to learn to speak it herself.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spoke a little now.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, that we mun,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said -LRB-which meant <div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, we must'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-RRB-.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell thee what us'll do first,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) proceeded, and Dickon grinned, because when the little wench tried to twist her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tongue into speaking Yorkshire it amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) very much.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s took a graidely fancy to thee.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wants to see thee and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wants to see Soot an' Captain.
<p/>When I go back to the house to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) I'll ax him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) if tha' canna' come an' see him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) tomorrow mornin'--an'.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stopped she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was quite proud of herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had never made a long speech in Yorkshire before and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had remembered very well.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' mun talk a bit o' Yorkshire like that to Mester Colin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>Dickon chuckled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha'll make him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) laugh an' there's nowt as good for ill folk as laughin' is.
<p/>Mother says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) believes as half a hour's good laugh every mornin' `ud cure a chap as was makin' ready for typhus fever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to talk Yorkshire to him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) this very day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, chuckling herself.
<p/>The garden had reached the time when every day and every night it seemed as if Magicians were passing through it drawing loveliness out of the earth and the boughs with wands.
<p/>It was hard to go away and leave it all, particularly as Nut had actually crept on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dress and Shell had scrambled down the trunk of the apple-tree they sat under and stayed there looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with inquiring eyes.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went back to the house and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sat down close to Colin's bed he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) began to sniff as Dickon did though not in such an experienced way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You smell like flowers and--and fresh things,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried out quite joyously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it you smell of?
<p/>It's cool and warm and sweet all at the same time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's th' wind from th' moor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It comes o' sittin' on th' grass under a tree wi' Dickon an' wi' Captain an' Soot an' Nut an' Shell.
<p/>It's th' springtime an' out o' doors an' sunshine as smells so graidely.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said it as broadly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could, and you do not know how broadly Yorkshire sounds until you have heard some one speak it.
<p/>Colin began to laugh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never heard you talk like that before.
<p/>How funny it sounds.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm givin' thee a bit o' Yorkshire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary triumphantly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I canna' talk as graidely as Dickon an' Martha can but tha' sees I can shape a bit.
<p/>Doesn't tha' understand a bit o' Yorkshire when tha' hears it?
<p/>An' tha' a Yorkshire lad thysel' bred an' born!
<p/>Eh!
<p/>I wonder tha`rt not ashamed o' thy face.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) began to laugh too and they both laughed until they could not stop themselves and they laughed until the room echoed and Mrs. Medlock opening the door to come in drew back into the corridor and stood listening amazed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, upon my word!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said, speaking rather broad Yorkshire herself because there was no one to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was so astonished.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whoever heard th' like!
<p/>Whoever on earth would ha' thought it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was so much to talk about.
<p/>It seemed as if Colin could never hear enough of Dickon and Captain and Soot and Nut and Shell and the pony whose name was Jump.
<p/>Mary had run round into the wood with Dickon to see Jump.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was a tiny little shaggy moor pony with thick locks hanging over his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) eyes and with a pretty face and a nuzzling velvet nose.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was rather thin with living on moor grass but he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was as tough and wiry as if the muscle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) little legs had been made of steel springs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) head and whinnied softly the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) saw Dickon and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had trotted up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) head across his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) shoulder and then Dickon had talked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ear and Jump had talked back in odd little whinnies and puffs and snorts.
<p/>Dickon had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) give Mary his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) small front hoof and kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cheek with his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) velvet muzzle.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) really understand everything Dickon says?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dickon says anything will understand if you're friends with it for sure, but you have to be friends for sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin lay quiet a little while and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) strange gray eyes seemed to be staring at the wall, but Mary saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was thinking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I was friends with things,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``but I'm not.
<p/>I never had anything to be friends with, and I can't bear people.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you bear me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's funny but I even like you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ben Weatherstaff said I was like him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'d warrant we'd both got the same nasty tempers.
<p/>I think you are like him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) too.
<p/>We are all three alike--you and I and Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said we were neither of us much to look at and we were as sour as we looked.
<p/>But I don't feel as sour as I used to before I knew the robin and Dickon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you feel as if you hated people?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary without any affectation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have detested you if I had seen you before I saw the robin and Dickon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thin hand and touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I wish I hadn't said what I did about sending Dickon away.
<p/>I hated you when you said he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was like an angel and I laughed at you but--but perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it was rather funny to say it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) admitted frankly, <div class="bookquote">``because his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) nose does turn up and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) has a big mouth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) clothes have patches all over them and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) talks broad Yorkshire, but--but if an angel did come to Yorkshire and live on the moor--if there was a Yorkshire angel--I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)'d understand the green things and know how to make them grow and he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) would know how to talk to the wild creatures as Dickon does and they'd know he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) was friends for sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't mind Dickon looking at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin; <div class="bookquote">``I want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).''

<p/>Colin knew something new was coming.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried eagerly.
<p/>Mary was so anxious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stool and came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) and caught hold of both his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hands.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I trust you?

<p/>Can I trust you--for sure--for sure?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) implored.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face was so solemn that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) almost whispered his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--yes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Dickon will come to see you tomorrow morning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'ll bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) creatures with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!

 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin cried out in delight.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But that's not all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary went on, almost pale with solemn excitement.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The rest is better.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had been a strong healthy boy Colin would probably have shouted <div class="bookquote">``Hooray!
<p/>Hooray!
<p/>Hooray!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was weak and rather hysterical; his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes grew bigger and bigger and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) gasped for breath.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>Mary!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried out with a half sob.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I see it?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you'll see it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>snapped Mary indignantly.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was so un-hysterical and natural and childish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) senses and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) began to laugh at himself and a few minutes afterward she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was sitting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stool again telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) not what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) imagined the secret garden to be like but what it really was, and Colin's aches and tiredness were forgotten and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was listening enraptured.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is just what you thought it would be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said at last.

<p/>How she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>)'s done it there's no telling.
<p/>The Lord knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>)'s nothing to look at and you scarcely ever hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) speak, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) did what none of us dare do.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) just flew at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) like a little cat last night, and stamped her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) feet and ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to stop screaming, and somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) startled him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) actually did stop, and this afternoon--well just come up and see, sir.
<p/>It's past crediting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div><p/>The scene which Dr. Craven beheld when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) patient's room was indeed rather astonishing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).
<p/>As Mrs. Medlock opened the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) heard laughing and chattering.
<p/>Colin was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sofa in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) dressing-gown and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was sitting up quite straight looking at a picture in one of the garden books and talking to the plain child who at that moment could scarcely be called plain at all because her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) face was so glowing with enjoyment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Those long spires of blue ones--we'll have a lot of those,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>Colin was announcing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're called Del-phin-iums.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dickon says they're larkspurs made big and grand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mistress</b></font>)</div>cried Mistress Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are clumps there already.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they saw Dr. Craven and stopped.
<p/>Mary became quite still and Colin looked fretful.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to hear you were ill last night, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div>Dr. Craven said a trifle nervously.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was rather a nervous man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm better now--much better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>Colin answered, rather like a Rajah.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going out in my chair in a day or two if it is fine.
<p/>I want some fresh air.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Craven sat down by him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) pulse and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) curiously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be a very fine day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and you must be very careful not to tire yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fresh air won't tire me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rajah</b></font>)</div>said the young Rajah.
<p/>As there had been occasions when this same young gentleman had shrieked aloud with rage and had insisted that fresh air would give him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cold and kill him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), it is not to be wondered at that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) doctor felt somewhat startled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you did not like fresh air,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't when I am by myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rajah</b></font>)</div>replied the Rajah; <div class="bookquote">``but my cousin is going out with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Rajah</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the nurse, of course?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>suggested Dr. Craven.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I will not have the nurse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>so magnificently that Mary could not help remembering how the young native Prince had looked with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) diamonds and emeralds and pearls stuck all over him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) and the great rubies on the small dark hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had waved to command his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) servants to approach with salaams and receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) orders.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My cousin knows how to take care of me.
<p/>I am always better when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is with me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made me better last night.
<p/>A very strong boy I know will push my carriage.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Craven felt rather alarmed.
<p/>If this tiresome hysterical boy should chance to get well he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) himself would lose all chance of inheriting Misselthwaite; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was not an unscrupulous man, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was a weak one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) did not intend to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) run into actual danger.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) must be a strong boy and a steady boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I must know something about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?
<p/>What is his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Dickon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary spoke up suddenly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt somehow that everybody who knew the moor must know Dickon.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was right, too.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw that in a moment Dr. Craven's serious face relaxed into a relieved smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Dickon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is Dickon you will be safe enough.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s as strong as a moor pony, is Dickon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s trusty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s th' trustiest lad i' Yorkshire.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been talking Yorkshire to Colin and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) forgot herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did Dickon teach you that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Dr. Craven, laughing outright.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm learning it as if it was French,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary rather coldly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's like a native dialect in India.
<p/>Very clever people try to learn them.
<p/>I like it and so does Colin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it amuses you perhaps it won't do you any harm.
<p/>Did you take your bromide last night, Colin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>Colin answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't take it at first and after Mary made me quiet she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) talked me to sleep--in a low voice--about the spring creeping into a garden.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That sounds soothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Craven, more perplexed than ever and glancing sideways at Mistress Mary sitting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stool and looking down silently at the carpet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are evidently better, but you must remember--''   (<font color='red'><b>the Rajah</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rajah</b></font>)</div>interrupted the Rajah, appearing again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I lie by myself and remember I begin to have pains everywhere and I think of things that make me begin to scream because I hate them so.
<p/>If there was a doctor anywhere who could make you forget you were ill instead of remembering it I would have him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) brought here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) waved a thin hand which ought really to have been covered with royal signet rings made of rubies.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is because my cousin makes me forget that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) makes me better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Craven had never made such a short stay after a <div class="bookquote">``tantrum'' (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div>; usually he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was obliged to remain a very long time and do a great many things.
<p/>This afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) did not give any medicine or leave any new orders and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was spared any disagreeable scenes.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) went downstairs he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) looked very thoughtful and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) talked to Mrs. Medlock in the library she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was a much puzzled man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) ventured, <div class="bookquote">``could you have believed it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is certainly a new state of affairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And there's no denying it is better than the old one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe Susan Sowerby's right--I do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Medlock.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I stopped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) cottage on my way to Thwaite yesterday and had a bit of talk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>).
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) says to me, `Well, Sarah Ann, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) mayn't be a good child, an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) mayn't be a pretty one, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>)'s a child, an' children needs children.'
<p/>We went to school together, Susan Sowerby and me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>)'s the best sick nurse I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Craven.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I find her (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) in a cottage I know the chances are that I shall save my patient.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Medlock smiled.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was fond of Susan Sowerby.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>)'s got a way with her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>), has Susan,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) went on quite volubly.
<p/>``I've been thinking all morning of one thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said yesterday.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) says, `Once when I was givin' th' children a bit of a preach after they'd been fightin' I ses to 'em all, <div class="bookquote">``When I was at school my jography told as th' world was shaped like a orange an' I found out before I was ten that th' whole orange doesn't belong to nobody.
<p/>No one owns more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) bit of a quarter an' there's times it seems like there's not enow quarters to go round.
<p/>But don't you--none o' you--think as you own th' whole orange or you'll find out you're mistaken, an' you won't find it out without hard knocks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`What children learns from children,' she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) says, `is that there's no sense in grabbin' at th' whole orange--peel an' all.
<p/>If you do you'll likely not get even th' pips, an' them's too bitter to eat.'''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s a shrewd woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Craven, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) coat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s got a way of saying things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>ended Mrs. Medlock, much pleased.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I've said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>), `Eh!
<p/>Susan, if you was a different woman an' didn't talk such broad Yorkshire I've seen the times when I should have said you was clever.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>That night Colin slept without once awakening and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes in the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lay still and smiled without knowing it--smiled because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) felt so curiously comfortable.
<p/>It was actually nice to be awake, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) turned over and stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) limbs luxuriously.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) felt as if tight strings which had held him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had loosened themselves and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) go.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not know that Dr. Craven would have said that his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) nerves had relaxed and rested themselves.
<p/>Instead of lying and staring at the wall and wishing he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had not awakened, his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) mind was full of the plans he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) and Mary had made yesterday, of pictures of the garden and of Dickon and his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) wild creatures.
<p/>It was so nice to have things to think about.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had not been awake more than ten minutes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) heard feet running along the corridor and Mary was at the door.
<p/>The next minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was in the room and had run across to his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) bed, bringing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a waft of fresh air full of the scent of the morning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been out!
<p/>You've been out!
<p/>There's that nice smell of leaves!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) cried.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been running and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hair was loose and blown and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was bright with the air and pink-cheeked, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) could not see it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's so beautiful!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, a little breathless with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) speed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You never saw anything so beautiful!
<p/>It has come!
<p/>I thought it had come that other morning, but it was only coming.
<p/>It is here now!
<p/>It has come, the Spring!
<p/>Dickon says so!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Colin, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) really knew nothing about it he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) heart beat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) actually sat up in bed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Open the window!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) added, laughing half with joyful excitement and half at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) own fancy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps we may hear golden trumpets!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And though he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) laughed, Mary was at the window in a moment and in a moment more it was opened wide and freshness and softness and scents and birds' songs were pouring through.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's fresh air,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lie on your back and draw in long breaths of it.
<p/>That's what Dickon does when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s lying on the moor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feels it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) veins and it makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) strong and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feels as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could live forever and ever.
<p/>Breathe it and breathe it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was only repeating what Dickon had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) caught Colin's fancy.
<p/>''`Forever and ever'!
<p/>Does it make him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feel like that?''
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), drawing in long deep breaths over and over again until he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) felt that something quite new and delightful was happening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>Mary was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) bedside again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Things are crowding up out of the earth,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran on in a hurry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And there are flowers uncurling and buds on everything and the green veil has covered nearly all the gray and the birds are in such a hurry about their nests for fear they may be too late that some of them are even fighting for places in the secret garden.
<p/>And the rose-bushes look as wick as wick can be, and there are primroses in the lanes and woods, and the seeds we planted are up, and Dickon has brought the fox and the crow and the squirrels and a new-born lamb.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) paused for breath.
<p/>The new-born lamb Dickon had found three days before lying by its dead mother among the gorse bushes on the moor.
<p/>It was not the first motherless lamb he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) had found and he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) knew what to do with it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) had taken it to the cottage wrapped in his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) jacket and he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) had let it lie near the fire and had fed it with warm milk.
<p/>It was a soft thing with a darling silly baby face and legs rather long for its body.
<p/>Dickon had carried it over the moor in his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) arms and its feeding bottle was in his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) pocket with a squirrel, and when Mary had sat under a tree with its limp warmness huddled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lap she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were too full of strange joy to speak.
<p/>A lamb--a lamb!
<p/>A living lamb who lay on your lap like a baby!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was describing it with great joy and Colin was listening and drawing in long breaths of air when the nurse entered.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) started a little at the sight of the open window.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had sat stifling in the room many a warm day because her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) patient was sure that open windows gave people cold.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure you are not chilly, Master Colin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) inquired.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am breathing long breaths of fresh air.
<p/>It makes you strong.
<p/>I am going to get up to the sofa for breakfast.
<p/>My cousin will have breakfast with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The nurse</b></font>)</div><p/>The nurse went away, concealing a smile, to give the order for two breakfasts.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) found the servants' hall a more amusing place than the invalid's chamber and just now everybody wanted to hear the news from upstairs.
<p/>There was a great deal of joking about the unpopular young recluse who, as the cook said, <div class="bookquote">``had found his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) master, and good for him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div><p/>The servants' hall had been very tired of the tantrums, and the butler, who was a man with a family, had more than once expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) opinion that the invalid would be all the better <div class="bookquote">``for a good hiding.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a family</b></font>)</div><p/>When Colin was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sofa and the breakfast for two was put upon the table he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) made an announcement to the nurse in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) most Rajah-like manner.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A boy, and a fox, and a crow, and two squirrels, and a new-born lamb, are coming to see me this morning.
<p/>I want them brought upstairs as soon as they come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not to begin playing with the animals in the servants' hall and keep them there.
<p/>I want them here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The nurse</b></font>)</div><p/>The nurse gave a slight gasp and tried to conceal it with a cough.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what you can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>added Colin, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can tell Martha to bring them here.
<p/>The boy is Martha's brother.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name is Dickon and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is an animal charmer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope the animals won't bite, Master Colin,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>said the nurse.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was a charmer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin austerely.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charmers' animals never bite.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are snake-charmers in India,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And they can put their snakes' heads in their mouths.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div><p/>shuddered the nurse.
<p/>They ate their breakfast with the morning air pouring in upon them.
<p/>Colin's breakfast was a very good one and Mary watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) with serious interest.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will begin to get fatter just as I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never wanted my breakfast when I was in India and now I always want it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted mine this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it was the fresh air.
<p/>When do you think Dickon will come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was not long in coming.
<p/>In about ten minutes Mary held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you hear a caw?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin listened and heard it, the oddest sound in the world to hear inside a house, a hoarse <div class="bookquote">``caw-caw.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's Soot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen again.
<p/>Do you hear a bleat--a tiny one?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin flushing</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Colin, quite flushing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the new-born lamb,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s coming.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon's moorland boots were thick and clumsy and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tried to walk quietly they made a clumping sound as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) walked through the long corridors.
<p/>Mary and Colin heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) marching--marching, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) passed through the tapestry door on to the soft carpet of Colin's own passage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>announced Martha, opening the door, <div class="bookquote">``if you please, sir, here's Dickon an' his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) creatures.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon came in smiling his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) nicest wide smile.
<p/>The new-born lamb was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) arms and the little red fox trotted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) side.
<p/>Nut sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) left shoulder and Soot on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) right and Shell's head and paws peeped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) coat pocket.
<p/>Colin slowly sat up and stared and stared--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had stared when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) first saw Mary; but this was a stare of wonder and delight.
<p/>The truth was that in spite of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had not in the least understood what this boy would be like and that his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fox and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) crow and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) squirrels and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lamb were so near to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) friendliness that they seemed almost to be part of himself.
<p/>Colin had never talked to a boy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) life and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was so overwhelmed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) own pleasure and curiosity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not even think of speaking.
<p/>But Dickon did not feel the least shy or awkward.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had not felt embarrassed because the crow had not known his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) language and had only stared and had not spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) the first time they met.
<p/>Creatures were always like that until they found out about you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) walked over to Colin's sofa and put the new-born lamb quietly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lap, and immediately the little creature turned to the warm velvet dressing-gown and began to nuzzle and nuzzle into its folds and butt its tight-curled head with soft impatience against his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) side.
<p/>Of course no boy could have helped speaking then.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it doing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it want?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wants its mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>said Dickon, smiling more and more.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I brought it to thee a bit hungry because I knowed tha'd like to see it feed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knelt down by the sofa and took a feeding-bottle from his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pocket.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, little `un,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, turning the small woolly white head with a gentle brown hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is what tha's after.
<p/>Tha'll get more out o' this than tha' will out o' silk velvet coats.
<p/>There now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pushed the rubber tip of the bottle into the nuzzling mouth and the lamb began to suck it with ravenous ecstasy.
<p/>After that there was no wondering what to say.
<p/>By the time the lamb fell asleep questions poured forth and Dickon answered them all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) told them how he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had found the lamb just as the sun was rising three mornings ago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had been standing on the moor listening to a skylark and watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) swing higher and higher into the sky until he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was only a speck in the heights of blue.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd almost lost him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) song an' I was wonderin' how a chap could hear it when it seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'d get out o' th' world in a minute--an' just then I heard somethin' else far off among th' gorse bushes.
<p/>It was a weak bleatin' an' I knowed it was a new lamb as was hungry an' I knowed it wouldn't be hungry if it hadn't lost its mother somehow, so I set off searchin'.
<p/>Eh!
<p/>I did have a look for it.
<p/>I went in an' out among th' gorse bushes an' round an' round an' I always seemed to take th' wrong turnin'.
<p/>But at last I seed a bit o' white by a rock on top o' th' moor an' I climbed up an' found th' little `un half dead wi' cold an' clemmin'.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) talked, Soot flew solemnly in and out of the open window and cawed remarks about the scenery while Nut and Shell made excursions into the big trees outside and ran up and down trunks and explored branches.
<p/>Captain curled up near Dickon, who sat on the hearth-rug from preference.
<p/>They looked at the pictures in the gardening books and Dickon knew all the flowers by their country names and knew exactly which ones were already growing in the secret garden.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldna' say that there name,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said, pointing to one under which was written <div class="bookquote">``Aquilegia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``but us calls that a columbine, an' that there one it's a snapdragon and they both grow wild in hedges, but these is garden ones an' they're bigger an' grander.
<p/>There's some big clumps o' columbine in th' garden.
<p/>They'll look like a bed o' blue an' white butterflies flutterin' when they're out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to see them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>cried Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to see them!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, that tha' mun,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary quite seriously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' tha' munnot lose no time about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XX  <div class="bookquote">``I SHALL LIVE FOREVER--AND EVER--AND EVER!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>But they were obliged to wait more than a week because first there came some very windy days and then Colin was threatened with a cold, which two things happening one after the other would no doubt have thrown him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) into a rage but that there was so much careful and mysterious planning to do and almost every day Dickon came in, if only for a few minutes, to talk about what was happening on the moor and in the lanes and hedges and on the borders of streams.
<p/>The things he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had to tell about otters' and badgers' and water-rats' houses, not to mention birds' nests and field-mice and their burrows, were enough to make you almost tremble with excitement when you heard all the intimate details from an animal charmer and realized with what thrilling eagerness and anxiety the whole busy underworld was working.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're same as us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>said Dickon, <div class="bookquote">``only they have to build their homes every year.
<p/>An' it keeps 'em so busy they fair scuffle to get 'em done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>The most absorbing thing, however, was the preparations to be made before Colin could be transported with sufficient secrecy to the garden.
<p/>No one must see the chair-carriage and Dickon and Mary after they turned a certain corner of the shrubbery and entered upon the walk outside the ivied walls.
<p/>As each day passed, Colin had become more and more fixed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feeling that the mystery surrounding the garden was one of its greatest charms.
<p/>Nothing must spoil that.
<p/>No one must ever suspect that they had a secret.
<p/>People must think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was simply going out with Mary and Dickon because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) liked them and did not object to their looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>They had long and quite delightful talks about their route.
<p/>They would go up this path and down that one and cross the other and go round among the fountain flower-beds as if they were looking at the <div class="bookquote">``bedding-out plants''  (<font color='red'><b>the head gardener Roach</b></font>)</div>the head gardener, Mr. Roach, had been having arranged.
<p/>That would seem such a rational thing to do that no one would think it at all mysterious.
<p/>They would turn into the shrubbery walks and lose themselves until they came to the long walls.
<p/>It was almost as serious and elaborately thought out as the plans of march made by great generals in time of war.
<p/>Rumors of the new and curious things which were occurring in the invalid's apartments had of course filtered through the servants' hall into the stable yards and out among the gardeners, but notwithstanding this, Mr. Roach was startled one day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) received orders from Master Colin's room to the effect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) must report himself in the apartment no outsider had ever seen, as the invalid himself desired to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) said to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) hurriedly changed his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) coat, <div class="bookquote">``what's to do now?
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) Royal Highness that wasn't to be looked at calling up a man he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>)'s never set eyes on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Roach was not without curiosity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) had never caught even a glimpse of the boy and had heard a dozen exaggerated stories about his (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) uncanny looks and ways and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) insane tempers.
<p/>The thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) had heard oftenest was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) might die at any moment and there had been numerous fanciful descriptions of a humped back and helpless limbs, given by people who had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Things are changing in this house, Mr. Roach,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Medlock, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) up the back staircase to the corridor on to which opened the hitherto mysterious chamber.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's hope they're changing for the better, Mrs. Medlock,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They couldn't well change for the worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) continued; <div class="bookquote">``and queer as it all is there's them as finds their duties made a lot easier to stand up under.
<p/>Don't you be surprised, Mr. Roach, if you find yourself in the middle of a menagerie and Martha Sowerby's Dickon more at home than you or me could ever be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There really was a sort of Magic about Dickon, as Mary always privately believed.
<p/>When Mr. Roach heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) name he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) smiled quite leniently.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>)'d be at home in Buckingham Palace or at the bottom of a coal mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet it's not impudence, either.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>)'s just fine, is that lad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was perhaps well he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) had been prepared or he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) might have been startled.
<p/>When the bedroom door was opened a large crow, which seemed quite at home perched on the high back of a carven chair, announced the entrance of a visitor by saying <div class="bookquote">``Caw--Caw''  (<font color='red'><b>a visitor</b></font>)</div>quite loudly.
<p/>In spite of Mrs. Medlock's warning, Mr. Roach only just escaped being sufficiently undignified to jump backward.
<p/>The young Rajah was neither in bed nor on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) sofa.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) was sitting in an armchair and a young lamb was standing by him (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) shaking its tail in feeding-lamb fashion as Dickon knelt giving it milk from its bottle.
<p/>A squirrel was perched on Dickon's bent back attentively nibbling a nut.
<p/>The little girl from India was sitting on a big footstool looking on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is Mr. Roach, Master Colin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Medlock.
<p/>The young Rajah turned and looked his (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) servitor over--at least that was what the head gardener felt happened.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you are Roach, are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I sent for you to give you some very important orders.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Roach/Roach</b></font>)</div>answered Roach, wondering if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) was to receive instructions to fell all the oaks in the park or to transform the orchards into water-gardens.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going out in my chair this afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If the fresh air agrees with me I may go out every day.
<p/>When I go, none of the gardeners are to be anywhere near the Long Walk by the garden walls.
<p/>No one is to be there.
<p/>I shall go out about two o'clock and everyone must keep away until I send word that they may go back to their work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Roach/Roach</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Roach, much relieved to hear that the oaks might remain and that the orchards were safe.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what is that thing you say in India when you have finished talking and want people to go?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say, `You have my permission to go,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary.
<p/>The Rajah waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have my permission to go, Roach,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, remember, this is very important.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Caw--Caw!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>remarked the crow hoarsely but not impolitely.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, sir.
<p/>Thank you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Roach/Roach</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Roach, and Mrs. Medlock took him (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) out of the room.
<p/>Outside in the corridor, being a rather good-natured man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiled until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) almost laughed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My word!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s got a fine lordly way with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?
<p/>You'd think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a whole Royal Family rolled into one--Prince Consort and all.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div><p/>protested Mrs. Medlock, <div class="bookquote">``we've had to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) trample all over every one of us ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had feet and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) thinks that's what folks was born for.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)'ll grow out of it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) lives,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Roach/Roach</b></font>)</div>suggested Mr. Roach.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's one thing pretty sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Medlock.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) does live and that Indian child stays here I'll warrant she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) teaches him (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) that the whole orange does not belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>), as Susan Sowerby says.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>)'ll be likely to find out the size of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) own quarter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Inside the room Colin was leaning back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cushions.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all safe now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And this afternoon I shall see it--this afternoon I shall be in it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon went back to the garden with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) creatures and Mary stayed with Colin.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked tired but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was very quiet before their lunch came and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was quiet while they were eating it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wondered why and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) about it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What big eyes you've got, Colin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you are thinking they get as big as saucers.
<p/>What are you thinking about now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help thinking about what it will look like,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The garden?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The springtime,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking that I've really never seen it before.
<p/>I scarcely ever went out and when I did go I never looked at it.
<p/>I didn't even think about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw it in India because there wasn't any,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/>Shut in and morbid as his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) life had been, Colin had more imagination than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had and at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had spent a good deal of time looking at wonderful books and pictures.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That morning when you ran in and said `It's come!
<p/>It's come!
<p/>', you made me feel quite queer.
<p/>It sounded as if things were coming with a great procession and big bursts and wafts of music.
<p/>I've a picture like it in one of my books--crowds of lovely people and children with garlands and branches with blossoms on them, everyone laughing and dancing and crowding and playing on pipes.
<p/>That was why I said, `Perhaps we shall hear golden trumpets' and told you to throw open the window.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How funny!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's really just what it feels like.
<p/>And if all the flowers and leaves and green things and birds and wild creatures danced past at once, what a crowd it would be!
<p/>I'm sure they'd dance and sing and flute and that would be the wafts of music.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They both laughed but it was not because the idea was laughable but because they both so liked it.
<p/>A little later the nurse made Colin ready.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) noticed that instead of lying like a log while his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) clothes were put on he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sat up and made some efforts to help himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) talked and laughed with Mary all the time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) good days, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to Dr. Craven, who dropped in to inspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s in such good spirits that it makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) stronger.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll call in again later in the afternoon, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) has come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Craven.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must see how the going out agrees with him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).
<p/>I wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in a very low voice, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) would let you go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather give up the case this moment, sir, than even stay here while it's suggested,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>answered the nurse.
<p/>With sudden firmness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hadn't really decided to suggest it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) slight nervousness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll try the experiment.
<p/>Dickon's a lad I'd trust with a new-born child.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The footman</b></font>)</div><p/>The strongest footman in the house carried Colin down stairs and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wheeled chair near which Dickon waited outside.
<p/>After the manservant had arranged his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) rugs and cushions the Rajah waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) and to the nurse.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have my permission to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, and they both disappeared quickly and it must be confessed giggled when they were safely inside the house.
<p/>Dickon began to push the wheeled chair slowly and steadily.
<p/>Mistress Mary walked beside it and Colin leaned back and lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face to the sky.
<p/>The arch of it looked very high and the small snowy clouds seemed like white birds floating on outspread wings below its crystal blueness.
<p/>The wind swept in soft big breaths down from the moor and was strange with a wild clear scented sweetness.
<p/>Colin kept lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thin chest to draw it in, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) big eyes looked as if it were they which were listening--listening, instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) ears.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are so many sounds of singing and humming and calling out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that scent the puffs of wind bring?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's gorse on th' moor that's openin' out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>answered Dickon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>th' bees are at it wonderful today.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a creature</b></font>)</div><p/>Not a human creature was to be caught sight of in the paths they took.
<p/>In fact every gardener or gardener's lad had been witched away.
<p/>But they wound in and out among the shrubbery and out and round the fountain beds, following their carefully planned route for the mere mysterious pleasure of it.
<p/>But when at last they turned into the Long Walk by the ivied walls the excited sense of an approaching thrill made them, for some curious reason they could not have explained, begin to speak in whispers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>breathed Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is where I used to walk up and down and wonder and wonder.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin eyes</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Colin, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes began to search the ivy with eager curiousness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can see nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) whispered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no door.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/>Then there was a lovely breathless silence and the chair wheeled on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the garden where Ben Weatherstaff works,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>said Colin.
<p/>A few yards more and Mary whispered again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is where the robin flew over the wall,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'d come again!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary with solemn delight, pointing under a big lilac bush, <div class="bookquote">``is where he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) perched on the little heap of earth and showed me the key.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Colin sat up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?
<p/>Where?
<p/>There?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes were as big as the wolf's in Red Riding-Hood, when Red Riding-Hood felt called upon to remark on them.
<p/>Dickon stood still and the wheeled chair stopped.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, stepping on to the bed close to the ivy, <div class="bookquote">``is where I went to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) chirped at me from the top of the wall.
<p/>And this is the ivy the wind blew back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took hold of the hanging green curtain.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>is it--is it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>gasped Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And here is the handle, and here is the door.
<p/>Dickon push him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) in--push him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) in quickly!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>And Dickon did it with one strong, steady, splendid push.
<p/>But Colin had actually dropped back against his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cushions, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) gasped with delight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hands and held them there shutting out everything until they were inside and the chair stopped as if by magic and the door was closed.
<p/>Not till then did he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) take them away and look round and round and round as Dickon and Mary had done.
<p/>And over walls and earth and trees and swinging sprays and tendrils the fair green veil of tender little leaves had crept, and in the grass under the trees and the gray urns in the alcoves and here and there everywhere were touches or splashes of gold and purple and white and the trees were showing pink and snow above his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head and there were fluttering of wings and faint sweet pipes and humming and scents and scents.
<p/>And the sun fell warm upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face like a hand with a lovely touch.
<p/>And in wonder Mary and Dickon stood and stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked so strange and different because a pink glow of color had actually crept all over him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)--ivory face and neck and hands and all.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall get well!
<p/>I shall get well!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary!
<p/>Dickon!
<p/>I shall get well!
<p/>And I shall live forever and ever and ever!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXI  BEN WEATHERSTAFF   One of the strange things about living in the world is that it is only now and then one is quite sure one is going to live forever and ever and ever.
<p/>One knows it sometimes when one gets up at the tender solemn dawn-time and goes out and stands alone and throws one's head far back and looks up and up and watches the pale sky slowly changing and flushing and marvelous unknown things happening until the East almost makes one cry out and one's heart stands still at the strange unchanging majesty of the rising of the sun--which has been happening every morning for thousands and thousands and thousands of years.
<p/>One knows it then for a moment or so.
<p/>And one knows it sometimes when one stands by oneself in a wood at sunset and the mysterious deep gold stillness slanting through and under the branches seems to be saying slowly again and again something one cannot quite hear, however much one tries.
<p/>Then sometimes the immense quiet of the dark blue at night with millions of stars waiting and watching makes one sure; and sometimes a sound of far-off music makes it true; and sometimes a look in some one's eyes.
<p/>And it was like that with Colin when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) first saw and heard and felt the Springtime inside the four high walls of a hidden garden.
<p/>That afternoon the whole world seemed to devote itself to being perfect and radiantly beautiful and kind to one boy.
<p/>Perhaps out of pure heavenly goodness the spring came and crowned everything it possibly could into that one place.
<p/>More than once Dickon paused in what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was doing and stood still with a sort of growing wonder in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head softly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>it is graidely,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm twelve goin' on thirteen an' there's a lot o' afternoons in thirteen years, but seems to me like I never seed one as graidely as this `ere.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, it is a graidely one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sighed for mere joy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll warrant it's the graidelest one as ever was in this world.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does tha' think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin with dreamy carefulness, <div class="bookquote">``as happen it was made loike this `ere all o' purpose for me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My word!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Mary admiringly, <div class="bookquote">``that there is a bit o' good Yorkshire.
<p/>Tha`rt shapin' first-rate--that tha' art.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>And delight reigned.
<p/>They drew the chair under the plum-tree, which was snow-white with blossoms and musical with bees.
<p/>It was like a king's canopy, a fairy king's.
<p/>There were flowering cherry-trees near and apple-trees whose buds were pink and white, and here and there one had burst open wide.
<p/>Between the blossoming branches of the canopy bits of blue sky looked down like wonderful eyes.
<p/>Mary and Dickon worked a little here and there and Colin watched them.
<p/>They brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) things to look at--buds which were opening, buds which were tight closed, bits of twig whose leaves were just showing green, the feather of a woodpecker which had dropped on the grass, the empty shell of some bird early hatched.
<p/>Dickon pushed the chair slowly round and round the garden, stopping every other moment to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) look at wonders springing out of the earth or trailing down from trees.
<p/>It was like being taken in state round the country of a magic king and queen and shown all the mysterious riches it contained.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if we shall see the robin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha'll see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) often enow after a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>answered Dickon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When th' eggs hatches out th' little chap he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'ll be kep' so busy it'll make his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) head swim.
<p/>Tha'll see him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) flyin' backward an' for`ard carryin' worms nigh as big as himsel' an' that much noise goin' on in th' nest when he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) gets there as fair flusters him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) so as he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) scarce knows which big mouth to drop th' first piece in.
<p/>An' gapin' beaks an' squawks on every side.
<p/>Mother says as when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) sees th' work a robin has to keep them gapin' beaks filled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) feels like she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) was a lady with nothin' to do.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s seen th' little chaps when it seemed like th' sweat must be droppin' off 'em, though folk can't see it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This made them giggle so delightedly that they were obliged to cover their mouths with their hands, remembering that they must not be heard.
<p/>Colin had been instructed as to the law of whispers and low voices several days before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) liked the mysteriousness of it and did his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) best, but in the midst of excited enjoyment it is rather difficult never to laugh above a whisper.
<p/>Every moment of the afternoon was full of new things and every hour the sunshine grew more golden.
<p/>The wheeled chair had been drawn back under the canopy and Dickon had sat down on the grass and had just drawn out his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pipe when Colin saw something he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had not had time to notice before.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a very old tree over there, isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/>Dickon looked across the grass at the tree and Mary looked and there was a brief moment of stillness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>answered Dickon, after it, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) low voice had a very gentle sound.
<p/>Mary gazed at the tree and thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The branches are quite gray and there's not a single leaf anywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>Colin went on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's quite dead, isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>admitted Dickon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But them roses as has climbed all over it will near hide every bit o' th' dead wood when they're full o' leaves an' flowers.
<p/>It won't look dead then.
<p/>It'll be th' prettiest of all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary still gazed at the tree and thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks as if a big branch had been broken off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder how it was done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's been done many a year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>answered Dickon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>with a sudden relieved start and laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand on Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at that robin!
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) is!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s been foragin' for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin was almost too late but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) just caught sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), the flash of red-breasted bird with something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) beak.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) darted through the greenness and into the close-grown corner and was out of sight.
<p/>Colin leaned back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cushion again, laughing a little.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s taking her (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) tea to her (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>).
<p/>Perhaps it's five o'clock.
<p/>I think I'd like some tea myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And so they were safe.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was Magic which sent the robin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary secretly to Dickon afterward.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it was Magic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For both she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and Dickon had been afraid Colin might ask something about the tree whose branch had broken off ten years ago and they had talked it over together and Dickon had stood and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head in a troubled way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We mun look as if it wasn't no different from th' other trees,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We couldn't never tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) how it broke, poor lad.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) says anything about it we mun--we mun try to look cheerful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, that we mun,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>had answered Mary.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked cheerful when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gazed at the tree.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wondered and wondered in those few moments if there was any reality in that other thing Dickon had said.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had gone on rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) rust-red hair in a puzzled way, but a nice comforted look had begun to grow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) blue eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Craven was a very lovely young lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had gone on rather hesitatingly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' mother she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thinks maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s about Misselthwaite many a time lookin' after Mester Colin, same as all mothers do when they're took out o' th' world.
<p/>They have to come back, tha' sees.
<p/>Happen she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s been in the garden an' happen it was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) set us to work, an' told us to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary had thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) meant something about Magic.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a great believer in Magic.
<p/>Secretly she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) quite believed that Dickon worked Magic, of course good Magic, on everything near him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) and that was why people liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) so much and wild creatures knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was their friend.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wondered, indeed, if it were not possible that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) gift had brought the robin just at the right moment when Colin asked that dangerous question.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) Magic was working all the afternoon and making Colin look like an entirely different boy.
<p/>It did not seem possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could be the crazy creature who had screamed and beaten and bitten his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pillow.
<p/>Even his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) ivory whiteness seemed to change.
<p/>The faint glow of color which had shown on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face and neck and hands when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) first got inside the garden really never quite died away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) were made of flesh instead of ivory or wax.
<p/>They saw the robin carry food to his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) mate two or three times, and it was so suggestive of afternoon tea that Colin felt they must have some.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and make one of the men servants bring some in a basket to the rhododendron walk,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then you and Dickon can bring it here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was an agreeable idea, easily carried out, and when the white cloth was spread upon the grass, with hot tea and buttered toast and crumpets, a delightfully hungry meal was eaten, and several birds on domestic errands paused to inquire what was going on and were led into investigating crumbs with great activity.
<p/>Nut and Shell whisked up trees with pieces of cake and Soot took the entire half of a buttered crumpet into a corner and pecked at and examined and turned it over and made hoarse remarks about it until he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) decided to swallow it all joyfully in one gulp.
<p/>The afternoon was dragging towards its mellow hour.
<p/>The sun was deepening the gold of its lances, the bees were going home and the birds were flying past less often.
<p/>Dickon and Mary were sitting on the grass, the tea-basket was repacked ready to be taken back to the house, and Colin was lying against his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cushions with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) heavy locks pushed back from his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) forehead and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face looking quite a natural color.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want this afternoon to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but I shall come back tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after, and the day after.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll get plenty of fresh air, won't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to get nothing else,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've seen the spring now and I'm going to see the summer.
<p/>I'm going to see everything grow here.
<p/>I'm going to grow here myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That tha' will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>said Dickon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Us'll have thee walkin' about here an' diggin' same as other folk afore long.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin flushed tremendously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Walk!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dig!
<p/>Shall I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon's glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was delicately cautious.
<p/>Neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) nor Mary had ever asked if anything was the matter with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) legs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For sure tha' will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said stoutly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha--tha's got legs o' thine own, same as other folks!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary was rather frightened until she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard Colin's answer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing really ails them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but they are so thin and weak.
<p/>They shake so that I'm afraid to try to stand on them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Both Mary and Dickon drew a relieved breath.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When tha' stops bein' afraid tha`lt stand on 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>Dickon said with renewed cheer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' tha`lt stop bein' afraid in a bit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>said Colin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lay still as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) were wondering about things.
<p/>They were really very quiet for a little while.
<p/>The sun was dropping lower.
<p/>It was that hour when everything stills itself, and they really had had a busy and exciting afternoon.
<p/>Colin looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) were resting luxuriously.
<p/>Even the creatures had ceased moving about and had drawn together and were resting near them.
<p/>Soot had perched on a low branch and drawn up one leg and dropped the gray film drowsily over his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Mary privately thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) might snore in a minute.
<p/>In the midst of this stillness it was rather startling when Colin half lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head and exclaimed in a loud suddenly alarmed whisper:  <div class="bookquote">``Who is that man?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon and Mary scrambled to their feet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Man!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>they both cried in low quick voices.
<p/>Colin pointed to the high wall.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) whispered excitedly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just look!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary and Dickon wheeled about and looked.
<p/>There was Ben Weatherstaff's indignant face glaring at them over the wall from the top of a ladder!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) actually shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) fist at Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I wasn't a bachelder, an' tha' was a wench o' mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I'd give thee a hidin'!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) mounted another step threateningly as if it were his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) energetic intention to jump down and deal with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) evidently thought better of it and stood on the top step of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) ladder shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) fist down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never thowt much o' thee!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) harangued.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldna' abide thee th' first time I set eyes on thee.
<p/>A scrawny buttermilk-faced young besom, allus askin' questions an' pokin' tha' nose where it wasna, wanted.
<p/>I never knowed how tha' got so thick wi' me.
<p/>If it hadna' been for th' robin--  Drat him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)--''   (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ben Weatherstaff,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>called out Mary, finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breath.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stood below him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) and called up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) with a sort of gasp.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ben Weatherstaff, it was the robin who showed me the way!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) stopped shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) fist very suddenly at that very moment and his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) jaw actually dropped as he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) stared over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head at something he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) saw coming over the grass toward him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>).
<p/>At the first sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) torrent of words Colin had been so surprised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had only sat up and listened as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) were spellbound.
<p/>But in the midst of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had recovered himself and beckoned imperiously to Dickon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wheel me over there!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) commanded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wheel me quite close and stop right in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>And this, if you please, this is what Ben Weatherstaff beheld and which made his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) jaw drop.
<p/>A wheeled chair with luxurious cushions and robes which came toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) looking rather like some sort of State Coach because a young Rajah leaned back in it with royal command in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) great black-rimmed eyes and a thin white hand extended haughtily toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>).
<p/>And it stopped right under Ben Weatherstaff's nose.
<p/>It was really no wonder his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) mouth dropped open.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know who I am?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Rajah</b></font>)</div><p/>demanded the Rajah.
<p/>How Ben Weatherstaff stared!
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) red old eyes fixed themselves on what was before him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) were seeing a ghost.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) gazed and gazed and gulped a lump down his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) throat and did not say a word.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know who I am?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>demanded Colin still more imperiously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Answer!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>Ben Weatherstaff put his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) gnarled hand up and passed it over his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) eyes and over his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) forehead and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did answer in a queer shaky voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who tha' art?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin forgot that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had ever had a back.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face flushed scarlet and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sat bolt upright.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not a cripple!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried out furiously.

 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>Ben Weatherstaff passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) forehead again and gazed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) could never gaze enough.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) hand shook and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) mouth shook and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) voice shook.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was an ignorant old man and a tactless old man and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) could only remember the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had heard.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha'--tha' hasn't got a crooked back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>quavered Ben more hoarsely yet.
<p/>It was too much.
<p/>The strength which Colin usually threw into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tantrums rushed through him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) now in a new way.
<p/>Never yet had he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) been accused of crooked legs--even in whispers--and the perfectly simple belief in their existence which was revealed by Ben Weatherstaff's voice was more than Rajah flesh and blood could endure.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) anger and insulted pride made him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) forget everything but this one moment and filled him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) with a power he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had never known before, an almost unnatural strength.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) shouted to Dickon, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) actually began to tear the coverings off his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) lower limbs and disentangle himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here!
<p/>Come here!
<p/>This minute!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon was by his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) side in a second.
<p/>Mary caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breath in a short gasp and felt herself turn pale.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) can do it!

<p/>There was a brief fierce scramble, the rugs were tossed on the ground, Dickon held Colin's arm, the thin legs were out, the thin feet were on the grass.
<p/>Colin was standing upright--upright--as straight as an arrow and looking strangely tall--his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head thrown back and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) strange eyes flashing lightning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) flung up at Ben Weatherstaff.

 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>What Ben Weatherstaff did Mary thought queer beyond measure.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) choked and gulped and suddenly tears ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) weather-wrinkled cheeks as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) old hands together.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) burst forth, <div class="bookquote">``th' lies folk tells!

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon held Colin's arm strongly but the boy had not begun to falter.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood straighter and straighter and looked Ben Weatherstaff in the face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm your master,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``when my father is away.

<p/>I want to talk to you.
<p/>We did not want you, but now you will have to be in the secret.
<p/>Be quick!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Ben Weatherstaff's crabbed old face was still wet with that one queer rush of tears.
<p/>It seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) could not take his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) eyes from thin straight Colin standing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feet with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head thrown back.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>my lad!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And then remembering himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) suddenly touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hat gardener fashion and said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir!
<p/>Yes, sir!''
 (<font color='red'><b>gardener</b></font>)</div><p/>and obediently disappeared as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) descended the ladder.
<p/>CHAPTER XXII  WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN   When his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head was out of sight Colin turned to Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said; and Mary flew across the grass to the door under the ivy.
<p/>Dickon was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) with sharp eyes.
<p/>There were scarlet spots on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cheeks and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked amazing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) showed no signs of falling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can stand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head was still held up and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said it quite grandly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told thee tha' could as soon as tha' stopped bein' afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>answered Dickon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' tha's stopped.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I've stopped,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/>Then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) remembered something Mary had said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you making Magic?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) asked sharply.
<p/>Dickon's curly mouth spread in a cheerful grin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha's doin' Magic thysel',''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's same Magic as made these `ere work out o' th' earth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) touched with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thick boot a clump of crocuses in the grass.
<p/>Colin looked down at them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said slowly, <div class="bookquote">``there couldna' be bigger Magic than that there--there couldna' be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) drew himself up straighter than ever.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to walk to that tree,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, pointing to one a few feet away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to be standing when Weatherstaff comes here.
<p/>I can rest against the tree if I like.
<p/>When I want to sit down I will sit down, but not before.
<p/>Bring a rug from the chair.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) walked to the tree and though Dickon held his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) arm he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was wonderfully steady.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) stood against the tree trunk it was not too plain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) supported himself against it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) still held himself so straight that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) looked tall.
<p/>When Ben Weatherstaff came through the door in the wall he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) standing there and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) heard Mary muttering something under her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breath.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What art sayin'?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) asked rather testily because he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did not want his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) attention distracted from the long thin straight boy figure and proud face.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>).
<p/>What she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was saying was this:  <div class="bookquote">``You can do it!
<p/>You can do it!

<p/>You can do it!
<p/>You can do it!
<p/>You can!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was saying it to Colin because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to make Magic and keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feet looking like that.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not bear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) should give in before Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did not give in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was uplifted by a sudden feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) looked quite beautiful in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) thinness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) eyes on Ben Weatherstaff in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) funny imperious way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) commanded.

 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>Ben Weatherstaff had not quite got over his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) emotion, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had recovered a little and answered almost in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) usual way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not tha',''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said.

 (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a queer mixture of crabbed tenderness and shrewd understanding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mester</b></font>) manner.
<p/>Mary had poured out speech as rapidly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could as they had come down the Long Walk.
<p/>The chief thing to be remembered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mester</b></font>), was that Colin was getting well--getting well.
<p/>The garden was doing it.
<p/>No one must let him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) remember about having humps and dying.
<p/>The Rajah condescended to seat himself on a rug under the tree.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What work do you do in the gardens, Weatherstaff?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) inquired.

<p/>Colin stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand and took it up.
<p/>An odd expression came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) began to scratch at the earth.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thin hand was weak enough but presently as they watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)--Mary with quite breathless interest--he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) drove the end of the trowel into the soil and turned some over.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can do it!
<p/>You can do it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary to herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you, you can!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon's round eyes were full of eager curiousness but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said not a word.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff looked on with interested face.
<p/>Colin persevered.
<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had turned a few trowelfuls of soil he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) spoke exultantly to Dickon in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) best Yorkshire.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' said as tha'd have me walkin' about here same as other folk--an' tha' said tha'd have me diggin'.
<p/>I thowt tha' was just leein' to please me.
<p/>This is only th' first day an' I've walked--an' here I am diggin'.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>Ben Weatherstaff's mouth fell open again when he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) ended by chuckling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that sounds as if tha'd got wits enow.
<p/>Tha`rt a Yorkshire lad for sure.
<p/>An' tha`rt diggin', too.
<p/>How'd tha' like to plant a bit o' somethin'?
<p/>I can get thee a rose in a pot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and get it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>said Colin, digging excitedly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quick!
<p/>Quick!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was done quickly enough indeed.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff went his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) way forgetting rheumatics.
<p/>Dickon took his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) spade and dug the hole deeper and wider than a new digger with thin white hands could make it.
<p/>Mary slipped out to run and bring back a watering-can.
<p/>When Dickon had deepened the hole Colin went on turning the soft earth over and over.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked up at the sky, flushed and glowing with the strangely new exercise, slight as it was.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to do it before the sun goes quite--quite down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/>Mary thought that perhaps the sun held back a few minutes just on purpose.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff brought the rose in its pot from the greenhouse.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) hobbled over the grass as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) could.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had begun to be excited, too.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) knelt down by the hole and broke the pot from the mould.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) said, handing the plant to Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Set it in the earth thysel' same as th' king does when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) goes to a new place.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>The thin white hands shook a little and Colin's flush grew deeper as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) set the rose in the mould and held it while old Ben made firm the earth.
<p/>It was filled in and pressed down and made steady.
<p/>Mary was leaning forward on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands and knees.
<p/>Soot had flown down and marched forward to see what was being done.
<p/>Nut and Shell chattered about it from a cherry-tree.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's planted!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>said Colin at last.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the sun is only slipping over the edge.
<p/>Help me up, Dickon.
<p/>I want to be standing when it goes.
<p/>That's part of the Magic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>And Dickon helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), and the Magic--or whatever it was--so gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) strength that when the sun did slip over the edge and end the strange lovely afternoon for them there he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) actually stood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) two feet--laughing.
<p/>CHAPTER XXIII  MAGIC   Dr. Craven had been waiting some time at the house when they returned to it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had indeed begun to wonder if it might not be wise to send some one out to explore the garden paths.
<p/>When Colin was brought back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) room the poor man looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) over seriously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should not have stayed so long,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not overexert yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not tired at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has made me well.
<p/>Tomorrow I am going out in the morning as well as in the afternoon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure that I can allow it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div>answered Dr. Craven.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid it would not be wise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would not be wise to try to stop me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin quite seriously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Even Mary had found out that one of Colin's chief peculiarities was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not know in the least what a rude little brute he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) way of ordering people about.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had lived on a sort of desert island all his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) life and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had been the king of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) own manners and had had no one to compare himself with.
<p/>Mary had indeed been rather like him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) herself and since she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been at Misselthwaite had gradually discovered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own manners had not been of the kind which is usual or popular.
<p/>Having made this discovery she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) naturally thought it of enough interest to communicate to Colin.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sat and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) curiously for a few minutes after Dr. Craven had gone.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was doing it and of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you looking at me for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm thinking that I am rather sorry for Dr.
<p/>Craven.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin calmly, but not without an air of some satisfaction.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) won't get Misselthwaite at all now I'm not going to die.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) because of that, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``but I was thinking just then that it must have been very horrid to have had to be polite for ten years to a boy who was always rude.
<p/>I would never have done it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I rude?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin inquired undisturbedly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) own boy and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had been a slapping sort of man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would have slapped you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) daren't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) daren't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mistress</b></font>)</div>answered Mistress Mary, thinking the thing out quite without prejudice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody ever dared to do anything you didn't like--because you were going to die and things like that.
<p/>You were such a poor thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>announced Colin stubbornly, <div class="bookquote">``I am not going to be a poor thing.
<p/>I won't let people think I'm one.
<p/>I stood on my feet this afternoon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is always having your own way that has made you so queer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary went on, thinking aloud.
<p/>Colin turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head, frowning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I queer?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) demanded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary, <div class="bookquote">``very.
<p/>But you needn't be cross,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) added impartially, <div class="bookquote">``because so am I queer--and so is Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>But I am not as queer as I was before I began to like people and before I found the garden.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to be queer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not going to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) frowned again with determination.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was a very proud boy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lay thinking for a while and then Mary saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) beautiful smile begin and gradually change his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) whole face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall stop being queer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if I go every day to the garden.
<p/>There is Magic in there--good Magic, you know, Mary.
<p/>I am sure there is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Even if it isn't real Magic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>Colin said, <div class="bookquote">``we can pretend it is.
<p/>Something is there--something!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Magic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``but not black.
<p/>It's as white as snow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>They always called it Magic and indeed it seemed like it in the months that followed--the wonderful months--the radiant months--the amazing ones.
<p/>Oh!
<p/>the things which happened in that garden!
<p/>If you have never had a garden you cannot understand, and if you have had a garden you will know that it would take a whole book to describe all that came to pass there.
<p/>At first it seemed that green things would never cease pushing their way through the earth, in the grass, in the beds, even in the crevices of the walls.
<p/>Then the green things began to show buds and the buds began to unfurl and show color, every shade of blue, every shade of purple, every tint and hue of crimson.
<p/>In its happy days flowers had been tucked away into every inch and hole and corner.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff had seen it done and had himself scraped out mortar from between the bricks of the wall and made pockets of earth for lovely clinging things to grow on.
<p/>Iris and white lilies rose out of the grass in sheaves, and the green alcoves filled themselves with amazing armies of the blue and white flower lances of tall delphiniums or columbines or campanulas.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) was main fond o' them--she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>Ben Weatherstaff said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) liked them things as was allus pointin' up to th' blue sky, she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) used to tell.
<p/>Not as she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) was one o' them as looked down on th' earth--not her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) just loved it but she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) said as th' blue sky allus looked so joyful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>The seeds Dickon and Mary had planted grew as if fairies had tended them.
<p/>Satiny poppies of all tints danced in the breeze by the score, gaily defying flowers which had lived in the garden for years and which it might be confessed seemed rather to wonder how such new people had got there.
<p/>And the roses--the roses!
<p/>Rising out of the grass, tangled round the sun-dial, wreathing the tree trunks and hanging from their branches, climbing up the walls and spreading over them with long garlands falling in cascades--they came alive day by day, hour by hour.
<p/>Fair fresh leaves, and buds--and buds--tiny at first but swelling and working Magic until they burst and uncurled into cups of scent delicately spilling themselves over their brims and filling the garden air.
<p/>Colin saw it all, watching each change as it took place.
<p/>Every morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was brought out and every hour of each day when it didn't rain he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) spent in the garden.
<p/>Even gray days pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would lie on the grass <div class="bookquote">``watching things growing,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/>If you watched long enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) declared, you could see buds unsheath themselves.
<p/>Also you could make the acquaintance of strange busy insect things running about on various unknown but evidently serious errands, sometimes carrying tiny scraps of straw or feather or food, or climbing blades of grass as if they were trees from whose tops one could look out to explore the country.
<p/>A mole throwing up its mound at the end of its burrow and making its way out at last with the long-nailed paws which looked so like elfish hands, had absorbed him (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>) one whole morning.
<p/>Ants' ways, beetles' ways, bees' ways, frogs' ways, birds' ways, plants' ways, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>) a new world to explore and when Dickon revealed them all and added foxes' ways, otters' ways, ferrets' ways, squirrels' ways, and trout' and water-rats' and badgers' ways, there was no end to the things to talk about and think over.
<p/>And this was not the half of the Magic.
<p/>The fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>) had really once stood on his (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>) feet had set Colin thinking tremendously and when Mary told him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) of the spell she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had worked he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was excited and approved of it greatly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) talked of it constantly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course there must be lots of Magic in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said wisely one day, <div class="bookquote">``but people don't know what it is like or how to make it.
<p/>Perhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happen until you make them happen.
<p/>I am going to try and experiment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The next morning when they went to the secret garden he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sent at once for Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>Ben came as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) could and found the Rajah standing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) feet under a tree and looking very grand but also very beautifully smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Ben Weatherstaff,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you and Dickon and Miss Mary to stand in a row and listen to me because I am going to tell you something very important.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye, sir!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>answered Ben Weatherstaff, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) forehead.
<p/>-LRB-One of the long concealed charms of Ben Weatherstaff was that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) boyhood he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had once run away to sea and had made voyages.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) could reply like a sailor.-RRB-
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to try a scientific experiment,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rajah</b></font>)</div>explained the Rajah.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I grow up I am going to make great scientific discoveries and I am going to begin now with this experiment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye, sir!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>said Ben Weatherstaff promptly, though this was the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had heard of great scientific discoveries.
<p/>It was the first time Mary had heard of them, either, but even at this stage she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had begun to realize that, queer as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was, Colin had read about a great many singular things and was somehow a very convincing sort of boy.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) held up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head and fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) strange eyes on you it seemed as if you believed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) almost in spite of yourself though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was only ten years old--going on eleven.
<p/>At this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was especially convincing because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) suddenly felt the fascination of actually making a sort of speech like a grown-up person.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The great scientific discoveries I am going to make,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``will be about Magic.
<p/>Magic is a great thing and scarcely any one knows anything about it except a few people in old books--and Mary a little, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was born in India where there are fakirs.
<p/>I believe Dickon knows some Magic, but perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) doesn't know he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knows it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) charms animals and people.
<p/>I would never have let him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) come to see me if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had not been an animal charmer--which is a boy charmer, too, because a boy is an animal.
<p/>I am sure there is Magic in everything, only we have not sense enough to get hold of it and make it do things for us--like electricity and horses and steam.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This sounded so imposing that Ben Weatherstaff became quite excited and really could not keep still.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) began to stand up quite straight.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When Mary found this garden it looked quite dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>the orator</b></font>)</div>the orator proceeded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then something began pushing things up out of the soil and making things out of nothing.
<p/>One day things weren't there and another they were.
<p/>I had never watched things before and it made me feel very curious.
<p/>Scientific people are always curious and I am going to be scientific.
<p/>I keep saying to myself, `What is it?
<p/>What is it?'
<p/>It's something.
<p/>It can't be nothing!
<p/>I don't know its name so I call it Magic.
<p/>I have never seen the sun rise but Mary and Dickon have and from what they tell me I am sure that is Magic too.
<p/>Something pushes it up and draws it.
<p/>Sometimes since I've been in the garden I've looked up through the trees at the sky and I have had a strange feeling of being happy as if something were pushing and drawing in my chest and making me breathe fast.
<p/>Magic is always pushing and drawing and making things out of nothing.
<p/>Everything is made out of Magic, leaves and trees, flowers and birds, badgers and foxes and squirrels and people.
<p/>So it must be all around us.
<p/>In this garden--in all the places.
<p/>The Magic in this garden has made me stand up and know I am going to live to be a man.
<p/>I am going to make the scientific experiment of trying to get some and put it in myself and make it push and draw me and make me strong.
<p/>I don't know how to do it but I think that if you keep thinking about it and calling it perhaps it will come.
<p/>Perhaps that is the first baby way to get it.
<p/>When I was going to try to stand that first time Mary kept saying to herself as fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could, `You can do it!
<p/>You can do it!'
<p/>and I did.
<p/>I had to try myself at the same time, of course, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Magic helped me--and so did Dickon's.
<p/>Every morning and evening and as often in the daytime as I can remember I am going to say, `Magic is in me!
<p/>Magic is making me well!
<p/>I am going to be as strong as Dickon, as strong as Dickon!'
<p/>And you must all do it, too.
<p/>That is my experiment Will you help, Ben Weatherstaff?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye, sir!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>said Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you keep doing it every day as regularly as soldiers go through drill we shall see what will happen and find out if the experiment succeeds.
<p/>You learn things by saying them over and over and thinking about them until they stay in your mind forever and I think it will be the same with Magic.
<p/>If you keep calling it to come to you and help you it will get to be part of you and it will stay and do things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I once heard an officer in India tell my mother that there were fakirs who said words over and over thousands of times,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.

 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) brows together and thought a few minutes.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cheered up.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Ben Weatherstaff chuckled and there was shrewd admiration in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) little old eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha`rt a clever lad as well as a straight-legged one, Mester Colin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Next time I see Bess Fettleworth I'll give her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a bit of a hint o' what Magic will do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'d be rare an' pleased if th' sinetifik `speriment worked--an' so `ud Jem.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon had stood listening to the lecture, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>) round eyes shining with curious delight.
<p/>Nut and Shell were on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>) shoulders and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>) held a long-eared white rabbit in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>) arm and stroked and stroked it softly while it laid its ears along its back and enjoyed itself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think the experiment will work?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), wondering what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was thinking.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) so often wondered what Dickon was thinking when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) or at one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``creatures''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) happy wide smile.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) smiled now and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) smile was wider than usual.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``that I do.
<p/>It'll work same as th' seeds do when th' sun shines on 'em.
<p/>It'll work for sure.
<p/>Shall us begin it now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin was delighted and so was Mary.
<p/>Fired by recollections of fakirs and devotees in illustrations Colin suggested that they should all sit cross-legged under the tree which made a canopy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be like sitting in a sort of temple,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm rather tired and I want to sit down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dickon, <div class="bookquote">``tha' mustn't begin by sayin' tha`rt tired.
<p/>Tha' might spoil th' Magic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin turned and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)--into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) innocent round eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said slowly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must only think of the Magic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It all seemed most majestic and mysterious when they sat down in their circle.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had somehow been led into appearing at a prayer-meeting.
<p/>Ordinarily he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was very fixed in being what he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) called <div class="bookquote">``agen' prayer-meetin's''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but this being the Rajah's affair he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) did not resent it and was indeed inclined to be gratified at being called upon to assist.
<p/>Mistress Mary felt solemnly enraptured.
<p/>Dickon held his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) rabbit in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) arm, and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) made some charmer's signal no one heard, for when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) sat down, cross-legged like the rest, the crow, the fox, the squirrels and the lamb slowly drew near and made part of the circle, settling each into a place of rest as if of their own desire.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The `creatures' have come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin gravely.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They want to help us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin really looked quite beautiful, Mary thought.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head high as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) felt like a sort of priest and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) strange eyes had a wonderful look in them.
<p/>The light shone on him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) through the tree canopy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we will begin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we sway backward and forward, Mary, as if we were dervishes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I canna' do no swayin' back`ard and for`ard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got th' rheumatics.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Magic will take them away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin in a High Priest tone, <div class="bookquote">``but we won't sway until it has done it.
<p/>We will only chant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Priest</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I canna' do no chantin'''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben Weatherstaff a trifle testily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They turned me out o' th' church choir th' only time I ever tried it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No one smiled.
<p/>They were all too much in earnest.
<p/>Colin's face was not even crossed by a shadow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was thinking only of the Magic.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will chant,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) began, looking like a strange boy spirit.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The sun is shining--the sun is shining.
<p/>That is the Magic.
<p/>The flowers are growing--the roots are stirring.
<p/>That is the Magic.
<p/>Being alive is the Magic--being strong is the Magic.
<p/>The Magic is in me--the Magic is in me.
<p/>It is in me--it is in me.
<p/>It's in every one of us.
<p/>It's in Ben Weatherstaff's back.
<p/>Magic!
<p/>Magic!
<p/>Come and help!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said it a great many times--not a thousand times but quite a goodly number.
<p/>Mary listened entranced.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt as if it were at once queer and beautiful and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) to go on and on.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff began to feel soothed into a sort of dream which was quite agreeable.
<p/>The humming of the bees in the blossoms mingled with the chanting voice and drowsily melted into a doze.
<p/>Dickon sat cross-legged with his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) rabbit asleep on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) arm and a hand resting on the lamb's back.
<p/>Soot had pushed away a squirrel and huddled close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) shoulder, the gray film dropped over his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>At last Colin stopped.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I am going to walk round the garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) announced.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff's head had just dropped forward and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) lifted it with a jerk.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been asleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nowt o' th' sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>mumbled Ben.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Th' sermon was good enow--but I'm bound to get out afore th' collection.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was not quite awake yet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not in church,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben, straightening himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who said I were?
<p/>I heard every bit of it.
<p/>You said th' Magic was in my back.
<p/>Th' doctor calls it rheumatics.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rajah</b></font>)</div><p/>The Rajah waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was the wrong Magic,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will get better.
<p/>You have my permission to go to your work.
<p/>But come back tomorrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd like to see thee walk round the garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>grunted Ben.
<p/>It was not an unfriendly grunt, but it was a grunt.
<p/>In fact, being a stubborn old party and not having entire faith in Magic he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) mind that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) were sent away he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) would climb his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) ladder and look over the wall so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) might be ready to hobble back if there were any stumbling.
<p/>The Rajah did not object to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) staying and so the procession was formed.
<p/>It really did look like a procession.
<p/>Colin was at its head with Dickon on one side and Mary on the other.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff walked behind, and the <div class="bookquote">``creatures''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>trailed after them, the lamb and the fox cub keeping close to Dickon, the white rabbit hopping along or stopping to nibble and Soot following with the solemnity of a person who felt himself in charge.
<p/>It was a procession which moved slowly but with dignity.
<p/>Every few yards it stopped to rest.
<p/>Colin leaned on Dickon's arm and privately Ben Weatherstaff kept a sharp lookout, but now and then Colin took his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand from its support and walked a few steps alone.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head was held up all the time and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked very grand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Magic is in me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) kept saying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Magic is making me strong!
<p/>I can feel it!
<p/>I can feel it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed very certain that something was upholding and uplifting him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sat on the seats in the alcoves, and once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sat down on the grass and several times he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) paused in the path and leaned on Dickon, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would not give up until he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had gone all round the garden.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) returned to the canopy tree his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cheeks were flushed and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked triumphant.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did it!
<p/>The Magic worked!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is my first scientific discovery.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What will Dr. Craven say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>broke out Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) won't say anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>Colin answered, <div class="bookquote">``because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) will not be told.
<p/>This is to be the biggest secret of all.
<p/>No one is to know anything about it until I have grown so strong that I can walk and run like any other boy.
<p/>I shall come here every day in my chair and I shall be taken back in it.
<p/>I won't have people whispering and asking questions and I won't let my father hear about it until the experiment has quite succeeded.
<p/>Then sometime when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comes back to Misselthwaite I shall just walk into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) study and say `Here I am; I am like any other boy.
<p/>I am quite well and I shall live to be a man.
<p/>It has been done by a scientific experiment.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is in a dream,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>cried Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't believe his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin flushed triumphantly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had made himself believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was going to get well, which was really more than half the battle, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had been aware of it.
<p/>And the thought which stimulated him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) more than any other was this imagining what his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) father would look like when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had a son who was as straight and strong as other fathers' sons.
<p/>One of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) darkest miseries in the unhealthy morbid past days had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hatred of being a sickly weak-backed boy whose father was afraid to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll be obliged to believe them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One of the things I am going to do, after the Magic works and before I begin to make scientific discoveries, is to be an athlete.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall have thee takin' to boxin' in a week or so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha`lt end wi' winnin' th' Belt an' bein' champion prize-fighter of all England.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sternly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Weatherstaff,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that is disrespectful.
<p/>You must not take liberties because you are in the secret.
<p/>However much the Magic works I shall not be a prize-fighter.
<p/>I shall be a Scientific Discoverer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ax pardon--ax pardon, sir''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>answered Ben, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) forehead in salute.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to have seed it wasn't a jokin' matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) eyes twinkled and secretly he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was immensely pleased.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) really did not mind being snubbed since the snubbing meant that the lad was gaining strength and spirit.
<p/>CHAPTER XXIV  <div class="bookquote">``LET THEM LAUGH''    (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>The secret garden was not the only one Dickon worked in.
<p/>Round the cottage on the moor there was a piece of ground enclosed by a low wall of rough stones.
<p/>Early in the morning and late in the fading twilight and on all the days Colin and Mary did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), Dickon worked there planting or tending potatoes and cabbages, turnips and carrots and herbs for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mother.
<p/>In the company of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``creatures''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did wonders there and was never tired of doing them, it seemed.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) dug or weeded he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) whistled or sang bits of Yorkshire moor songs or talked to Soot or Captain or the brothers and sisters he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had taught to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'd never get on as comfortable as we do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerby</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sowerby said, <div class="bookquote">``if it wasn't for Dickon's garden.
<p/>Anything'll grow for him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) `taters and cabbages is twice th' size of any one else's an' they've got a flavor with 'em as nobody's has.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerby</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) found a moment to spare she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) liked to go out and talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).
<p/>After supper there was still a long clear twilight to work in and that was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) quiet time.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) could sit upon the low rough wall and look on and hear stories of the day.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) loved this time.
<p/>There were not only vegetables in this garden.
<p/>Dickon had bought penny packages of flower seeds now and then and sown bright sweet-scented things among gooseberry bushes and even cabbages and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) grew borders of mignonette and pinks and pansies and things whose seeds he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) could save year after year or whose roots would bloom each spring and spread in time into fine clumps.
<p/>The low wall was one of the prettiest things in Yorkshire because he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had tucked moorland foxglove and ferns and rock-cress and hedgerow flowers into every crevice until only here and there glimpses of the stones were to be seen.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All a chap's got to do to make 'em thrive, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``is to be friends with 'em for sure.
<p/>They're just like th' `creatures.'
<p/>If they're thirsty give 'em drink and if they're hungry give 'em a bit o' food.
<p/>They want to live same as we do.
<p/>If they died I should feel as if I'd been a bad lad and somehow treated them heartless.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was in these twilight hours that Mrs. Sowerby heard of all that happened at Misselthwaite Manor.
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) was only told that <div class="bookquote">``Mester Colin''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>had taken a fancy to going out into the grounds with Miss Mary and that it was doing him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) good.
<p/>But it was not long before it was agreed between the two children that Dickon's mother might <div class="bookquote">``come into the secret.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Somehow it was not doubted that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``safe for sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So one beautiful still evening Dickon told the whole story, with all the thrilling details of the buried key and the robin and the gray haze which had seemed like deadness and the secret Mistress Mary had planned never to reveal.
<p/>The coming of Dickon and how it had been told to him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>), the doubt of Mester Colin and the final drama of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) introduction to the hidden domain, combined with the incident of Ben Weatherstaff's angry face peering over the wall and Mester Colin's sudden indignant strength, made Mrs. Sowerby's nice-looking face quite change color several times.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My word!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a good thing that little lass came to th' Manor.
<p/>It's been th' makin' o' her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) an' th' savin, o' him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>Standin' on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feet!
<p/>An' us all thinkin' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was a poor half-witted lad with not a straight bone in him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) asked a great many questions and her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) blue eyes were full of deep thinking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do they make of it at th' Manor--him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) being so well an' cheerful an' never complainin'?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) inquired.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They don't know what to make of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>answered Dickon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Every day as comes round his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face looks different.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What for, i' Mercy's name?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerby</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Mrs. Sowerby.
<p/>Dickon chuckled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) does it to keep them from guessin' what's happened.
<p/>If the doctor knew he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'d found out he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) could stand on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) feet he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'d likely write and tell Mester Craven.
<p/>Mester Colin's savin' th' secret to tell himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s goin' to practise his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) Magic on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) legs every day till his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) father comes back an' then he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s goin' to march into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) room an' show him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s as straight as other lads.
<p/>But him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) an' Miss Mary thinks it's best plan to do a bit o' groanin' an' frettin' now an' then to throw folk off th' scent.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Sowerby was laughing a low comfortable laugh long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) last sentence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that pair's enjoyin' their-selves I'll warrant.

<p/>Let's hear what they do, Dickon lad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon stopped weeding and sat up on his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) heels to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) eyes were twinkling with fun.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mester Colin is carried down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) chair every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) goes out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) explained.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) flies out at John, th' footman, for not carryin' him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) careful enough.

<p/>An' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) grunts an' frets a good bit when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s bein' settled into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) chair.

<p/>--but th' trouble is that sometimes they can scarce keep from burstin' out laughin'.
<p/>When we get safe into the garden they laugh till they've no breath left to laugh with.
<p/>An' they have to stuff their faces into Mester Colin's cushions to keep the gardeners from hearin', if any of, 'em's about.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Th' more they laugh th' better for 'em!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerby</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mrs. Sowerby, still laughing herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good healthy child laughin's better than pills any day o' th' year.
<p/>That pair'll plump up for sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are plumpin' up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>said Dickon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're that hungry they don't know how to get enough to eat without makin' talk.
<p/>Mester Colin says if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) keeps sendin' for more food they won't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s an invalid at all.
<p/>Miss Mary says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'ll let him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eat her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) share, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) says that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) goes hungry she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'ll get thin an' they mun both get fat at once.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerby</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Sowerby laughed so heartily at the revelation of this difficulty that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) quite rocked backward and forward in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) blue cloak, and Dickon laughed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell thee what, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerby</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sowerby said when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) could speak.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've thought of a way to help 'em.
<p/>When tha' goes to 'em in th' mornin's tha' shall take a pail o' good new milk an' I'll bake 'em a crusty cottage loaf or some buns wi' currants in 'em, same as you children like.
<p/>Nothin's so good as fresh milk an' bread.
<p/>Then they could take off th' edge o' their hunger while they were in their garden an' th, fine food they get indoors `ud polish off th' corners.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>mother!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dickon admiringly, <div class="bookquote">``what a wonder tha' art!
<p/>Tha' always sees a way out o' things.
<p/>They was quite in a pother yesterday.
<p/>They didn't see how they was to manage without orderin' up more food--they felt that empty inside.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're two young `uns growin' fast, an' health's comin' back to both of 'em.
<p/>Children like that feels like young wolves an' food's flesh an' blood to 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerby</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerby.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) smiled Dickon's own curving smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>but they're enjoyin' theirselves for sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) was quite right, the comfortable wonderful mother creature--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) had never been more so than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) said their <div class="bookquote">``play actin'''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>would be their joy.
<p/>Colin and Mary found it one of their most thrilling sources of entertainment.
<p/>The idea of protecting themselves from suspicion had been unconsciously suggested to them first by the puzzled nurse and then by Dr. Craven himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your appetite.
<p/>Is improving very much, Master Colin,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>the nurse had said one day.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You used to eat nothing, and so many things disagreed with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing disagrees with me now''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>replied Colin, and then seeing the nurse looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) curiously he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) suddenly remembered that perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) ought not to appear too well just yet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At least things don't so often disagree with me.
<p/>It's the fresh air.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>said the nurse, still looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) with a mystified expression.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must talk to Dr. Craven about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) stared at you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mary when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``As if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought there must be something to find out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't have her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) finding out things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one must begin to find out yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>When Dr. Craven came that morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) seemed puzzled, also.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) asked a number of questions, to Colin's great annoyance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You stay out in the garden a great deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) suggested.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do you go?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) favorite air of dignified indifference to opinion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not let any one know where I go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I go to a place I like.
<p/>Every one has orders to keep out of the way.
<p/>I won't be watched and stared at.
<p/>You know that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to be out all day but I do not think it has done you harm--I do not think so.
<p/>The nurse says that you eat much more than you have ever done before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin</b></font>)</div>said Colin, prompted by a sudden inspiration, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps it is an unnatural appetite.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think so, as your food seems to agree with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Craven.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are gaining flesh rapidly and your color is better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps--perhaps I am bloated and feverish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin, assuming a discouraging air of gloom.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``People who are not going to live are often--different.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Craven shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) head.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was holding Colin's wrist and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pushed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sleeve and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) arm.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not feverish,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``and such flesh as you have gained is healthy.
<p/>If you can keep this up, my boy, we need not talk of dying.
<p/>Your father will be happy to hear of this remarkable improvement.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin broke forth fiercely.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will only disappoint him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) if I get worse again--and I may get worse this very night.
<p/>I might have a raging fever.
<p/>I feel as if I might be beginning to have one now.
<p/>I won't have letters written to my father--I won't--I won't!
<p/>You are making me angry and you know that is bad for me.
<p/>I feel hot already.
<p/>I hate being written about and being talked over as much as I hate being stared at!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush-h!
<p/>my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div>Dr. Craven soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing shall be written without your permission.
<p/>You are too sensitive about things.
<p/>You must not undo the good which has been done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said no more about writing to Mr. Craven and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) saw the nurse he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) privately warned her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) that such a possibility must not be mentioned to the patient.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The boy is extraordinarily better,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) advance seems almost abnormal.
<p/>But of course he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is doing now of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own free will what we could not make him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) do before.
<p/>Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) excites himself very easily and nothing must be said to irritate him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary and Colin were much alarmed and talked together anxiously.
<p/>From this time dated their plan of <div class="bookquote">``play actin'.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may be obliged to have a tantrum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin regretfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to have one and I'm not miserable enough now to work myself into a big one.
<p/>Perhaps I couldn't have one at all.
<p/>That lump doesn't come in my throat now and I keep thinking of nice things instead of horrible ones.
<p/>But if they talk about writing to my father I shall have to do something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind to eat less, but unfortunately it was not possible to carry out this brilliant idea when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wakened each morning with an amazing appetite and the table near his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sofa was set with a breakfast of home-made bread and fresh butter, snow-white eggs, raspberry jam and clotted cream.
<p/>Mary always breakfasted with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and when they found themselves at the table--particularly if there were delicate slices of sizzling ham sending forth tempting odors from under a hot silver cover--they would look into each other's eyes in desperation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we shall have to eat it all this morning, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>Colin always ended by saying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can send away some of the lunch and a great deal of the dinner.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But they never found they could send away anything and the highly polished condition of the empty plates returned to the pantry awakened much comment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>Colin would say also, <div class="bookquote">``I do wish the slices of ham were thicker, and one muffin each is not enough for any one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's enough for a person who is going to die,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary when first she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard this, <div class="bookquote">``but it's not enough for a person who is going to live.
<p/>I sometimes feel as if I could eat three when those nice fresh heather and gorse smells from the moor come pouring in at the open window.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The morning that Dickon--after they had been enjoying themselves in the garden for about two hours--went behind a big rosebush and brought forth two tin pails and revealed that one was full of rich new milk with cream on the top of it, and that the other held cottage-made currant buns folded in a clean blue and white napkin, buns so carefully tucked in that they were still hot, there was a riot of surprised joyfulness.
<p/>What a wonderful thing for Mrs. Sowerby to think of!
<p/>What a kind, clever woman she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must be!
<p/>How good the buns were!
<p/>And what delicious fresh milk!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Magic is in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) just as it is in Dickon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It makes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) think of ways to do things--nice things.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a Magic person.
<p/>Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) we are grateful, Dickon--extremely grateful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was given to using rather grown-up phrases at times.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) enjoyed them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) liked this so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) improved upon it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been most bounteous and our gratitude is extreme.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And then forgetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) grandeur he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) fell to and stuffed himself with buns and drank milk out of the pail in copious draughts in the manner of any hungry little boy who had been taking unusual exercise and breathing in moorland air and whose breakfast was more than two hours behind him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>This was the beginning of many agreeable incidents of the same kind.
<p/>They actually awoke to the fact that as Mrs. Sowerby had fourteen people to provide food for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) might not have enough to satisfy two extra appetites every day.
<p/>So they asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) to let them send some of their shillings to buy things.
<p/>Dickon made the stimulating discovery that in the wood in the park outside the garden where Mary had first found him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) piping to the wild creatures there was a deep little hollow where you could build a sort of tiny oven with stones and roast potatoes and eggs in it.
<p/>Roasted eggs were a previously unknown luxury and very hot potatoes with salt and fresh butter in them were fit for a woodland king--besides being deliciously satisfying.
<p/>You could buy both potatoes and eggs and eat as many as you liked without feeling as if you were taking food out of the mouths of fourteen people.
<p/>Every beautiful morning the Magic was worked by the mystic circle under the plum-tree which provided a canopy of thickening green leaves after its brief blossom-time was ended.
<p/>After the ceremony Colin always took his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) walking exercise and throughout the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) exercised his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) newly found power at intervals.
<p/>Each day he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) grew stronger and could walk more steadily and cover more ground.
<p/>And each day his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) belief in the Magic grew stronger--as well it might.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tried one experiment after another as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) felt himself gaining strength and it was Dickon who showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) the best things of all.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said one morning after an absence, <div class="bookquote">``I went to Thwaite for mother an' near th' Blue Cow Inn I seed Bob Haworth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Haworth</b></font>)'s the strongest chap on th' moor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Haworth</b></font>)'s the champion wrestler an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Haworth</b></font>) can jump higher than any other chap an' throw th' hammer farther.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s gone all th' way to Scotland for th' sports some years.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s knowed me ever since I was a little `un an' he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s a friendly sort an' I axed him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) some questions.
<p/>Th' gentry calls him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) a athlete and I thought o' thee, Mester Colin, and I says, `How did tha' make tha' muscles stick out that way, Bob?
<p/>Did tha' do anythin' extra to make thysel' so strong?'
<p/>An' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) says `Well, yes, lad, I did.
<p/>A strong man in a show that came to Thwaite once showed me how to exercise my arms an' legs an' every muscle in my body.
<p/>An' I says, `Could a delicate chap make himself stronger with 'em, Bob?'
<p/>an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) laughed an' says, `Art tha' th' delicate chap?'
<p/>an' I says, `No, but I knows a young gentleman that's gettin' well of a long illness an' I wish I knowed some o' them tricks to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) about.'
<p/>I didn't say no names an' he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) didn't ask none.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s friendly same as I said an' he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stood up an' showed me good-natured like, an' I imitated what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did till I knowed it by heart.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin had been listening excitedly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you show me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>Dickon answered, getting up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) says tha' mun do 'em gentle at first an' be careful not to tire thysel'.
<p/>Rest in between times an' take deep breaths an' don't overdo.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be careful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Show me!
<p/>Show me!
<p/>Dickon, you are the most Magic boy in the world!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon stood up on the grass and slowly went through a carefully practical but simple series of muscle exercises.
<p/>Colin watched them with widening eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could do a few while he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was sitting down.
<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did a few gently while he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) stood upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) already steadied feet.
<p/>Mary began to do them also.
<p/>Soot, who was watching the performance, became much disturbed and left his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) branch and hopped about restlessly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could not do them too.
<p/>From that time the exercises were part of the day's duties as much as the Magic was.
<p/>It became possible for both Colin and Mary to do more of them each time they tried, and such appetites were the results that but for the basket Dickon put down behind the bush each morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) arrived they would have been lost.
<p/>But the little oven in the hollow and Mrs. Sowerby's bounties were so satisfying that Mrs. Medlock and the nurse and Dr. Craven became mystified again.
<p/>You can trifle with your breakfast and seem to disdain your dinner if you are full to the brim with roasted eggs and potatoes and richly frothed new milk and oatcakes and buns and heather honey and clotted cream.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are eating next to nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>said the nurse.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll die of starvation if they can't be persuaded to take some nourishment.
<p/>And yet see how they look.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div><p/>exclaimed Mrs. Medlock indignantly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>I'm moithered to death with them.
<p/>They're a pair of young Satans.
<p/>Bursting their jackets one day and the next turning up their noses at the best meals Cook can tempt them with.
<p/>Not a mouthful of that lovely young fowl and bread sauce did they set a fork into yesterday--and the poor woman fair invented a pudding for them--and back it's sent.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) almost cried.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll be blamed if they starve themselves into their graves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Craven came and looked at Colin long and carefully, He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wore an extremely worried expression when the nurse talked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) the almost untouched tray of breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had saved for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) to look at--but it was even more worried when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sat down by Colin's sofa and examined him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had been called to London on business and had not seen the boy for nearly two weeks.
<p/>When young things begin to gain health they gain it rapidly.
<p/>The waxen tinge had left, Colins skin and a warm rose showed through it; his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) beautiful eyes were clear and the hollows under them and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cheeks and temples had filled out.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) once dark, heavy locks had begun to look as if they sprang healthily from his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) forehead and were soft and warm with life.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lips were fuller and of a normal color.
<p/>In fact as an imitation of a boy who was a confirmed invalid he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a disgraceful sight.
<p/>Dr. Craven held his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) chin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) hand and thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) over.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to hear that you do not eat anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will not do.
<p/>You will lose all you have gained--and you have gained amazingly.
<p/>You ate so well a short time ago.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you it was an unnatural appetite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>answered Colin.
<p/>Mary was sitting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stool nearby and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) suddenly made a very queer sound which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tried so violently to repress that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ended by almost choking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dr. Craven, turning to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>Mary became quite severe in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) manner.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was something between a sneeze and a cough,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) replied with reproachful dignity, <div class="bookquote">``and it got into my throat.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said afterward to Colin, <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't stop myself.
<p/>It just burst out because all at once I couldn't help remembering that last big potato you ate and the way your mouth stretched when you bit through that thick lovely crust with jam and clotted cream on it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there any way in which those children can get food secretly?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Craven inquired of Mrs. Medlock.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no way unless they dig it out of the earth or pick it off the trees,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Medlock answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They stay out in the grounds all day and see no one but each other.
<p/>And if they want anything different to eat from what's sent up to them they need only ask for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Craven, <div class="bookquote">``so long as going without food agrees with them we need not disturb ourselves.
<p/>The boy is a new creature.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So is the girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Medlock.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXV  THE CURTAIN   And the secret garden bloomed and bloomed and every morning revealed new miracles.
<p/>In the robin's nest there were Eggs and the robin's mate sat upon them keeping them warm with her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) feathery little breast and careful wings.
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was very nervous and the robin himself was indignantly watchful.
<p/>Even Dickon did not go near the close-grown corner in those days, but waited until by the quiet working of some mysterious spell he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) seemed to have conveyed to the soul of the little pair that in the garden there was nothing which was not quite like themselves--nothing which did not understand the wonderfulness of what was happening to them--the immense, tender, terrible, heart-breaking beauty and solemnity of Eggs.
<p/>If there had been one person in that garden who had not known through all his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) innermost being that if an Egg were taken away or hurt the whole world would whirl round and crash through space and come to an end--if there had been even one who did not feel it and act accordingly there could have been no happiness even in that golden springtime air.
<p/>But they all knew it and felt it and the robin and his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) mate knew they knew it.
<p/>At first the robin watched Mary and Colin with sharp anxiety.
<p/>For some mysterious reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) need not watch Dickon.
<p/>The first moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) dew-bright black eye on Dickon he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was not a stranger but a sort of robin without beak or feathers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) could speak robin -LRB-which is a quite distinct language not to be mistaken for any other-RRB-.
<p/>To speak robin to a robin is like speaking French to a Frenchman.
<p/>Dickon always spoke it to the robin himself, so the queer gibberish he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) used when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) spoke to humans did not matter in the least.
<p/>The robin thought he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) spoke this gibberish to them because they were not intelligent enough to understand feathered speech.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) movements also were robin.
<p/>They never startled one by being sudden enough to seem dangerous or threatening.
<p/>Any robin could understand Dickon, so his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) presence was not even disturbing.
<p/>But at the outset it seemed necessary to be on guard against the other two.
<p/>In the first place the boy creature did not come into the garden on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) legs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was pushed in on a thing with wheels and the skins of wild animals were thrown over him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>That in itself was doubtful.
<p/>Then when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began to stand up and move about he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did it in a queer unaccustomed way and the others seemed to have to help him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>The robin used to secrete himself in a bush and watch this anxiously, his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) head tilted first on one side and then on the other.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) thought that the slow movements might mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was preparing to pounce, as cats do.
<p/>When cats are preparing to pounce they creep over the ground very slowly.
<p/>The robin talked this over with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) mate a great deal for a few days but after that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) decided not to speak of the subject because her (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) terror was so great that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was afraid it might be injurious to the Eggs.
<p/>When the boy began to walk by himself and even to move more quickly it was an immense relief.
<p/>But for a long time--or it seemed a long time to the robin--he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was a source of some anxiety.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) did not act as the other humans did.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) seemed very fond of walking but he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had a way of sitting or lying down for a while and then getting up in a disconcerting manner to begin again.
<p/>One day the robin remembered that when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) himself had been made to learn to fly by his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) parents he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had done much the same sort of thing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had taken short flights of a few yards and then had been obliged to rest.
<p/>So it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) that this boy was learning to fly--or rather to walk.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mentioned this to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mate and when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) that the Eggs would probably conduct themselves in the same way after they were fledged she (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was quite comforted and even became eagerly interested and derived great pleasure from watching the boy over the edge of her (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) nest--though she (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) always thought that the Eggs would be much cleverer and learn more quickly.
<p/>But then she (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said indulgently that humans were always more clumsy and slow than Eggs and most of them never seemed really to learn to fly at all.
<p/>You never met them in the air or on tree-tops.
<p/>After a while the boy began to move about as the others did, but all three of the children at times did unusual things.
<p/>They would stand under the trees and move their arms and legs and heads about in a way which was neither walking nor running nor sitting down.
<p/>They went through these movements at intervals every day and the robin was never able to explain to his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) mate what they were doing or tying to do.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) could only say that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was sure that the Eggs would never flap about in such a manner; but as the boy who could speak robin so fluently was doing the thing with them, birds could be quite sure that the actions were not of a dangerous nature.
<p/>Of course neither the robin nor his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) mate had ever heard of the champion wrestler, Bob Haworth, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Haworth</b></font>) exercises for making the muscles stand out like lumps.
<p/>Robins are not like human beings; their muscles are always exercised from the first and so they develop themselves in a natural manner.
<p/>If you have to fly about to find every meal you eat, your muscles do not become atrophied -LRB-atrophied means wasted away through want of use-RRB-.
<p/>When the boy was walking and running about and digging and weeding like the others, the nest in the corner was brooded over by a great peace and content.
<p/>Fears for the Eggs became things of the past.
<p/>Knowing that your Eggs were as safe as if they were locked in a bank vault and the fact that you could watch so many curious things going on made setting a most entertaining occupation.
<p/>On wet days the Eggs' mother sometimes felt even a little dull because the children did not come into the garden.
<p/>But even on wet days it could not be said that Mary and Colin were dull.
<p/>One morning when the rain streamed down unceasingly and Colin was beginning to feel a little restive, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was obliged to remain on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sofa because it was not safe to get up and walk about, Mary had an inspiration.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now that I am a real boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>Colin had said, <div class="bookquote">``my legs and arms and all my body are so full of Magic that I can't keep them still.
<p/>They want to be doing things all the time.
<p/>Do you know that when I waken in the morning, Mary, when it's quite early and the birds are just shouting outside and everything seems just shouting for joy--even the trees and things we can't really hear--I feel as if I must jump out of bed and shout myself.
<p/>If I did it, just think what would happen!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary giggled inordinately.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The nurse would come running and Mrs. Medlock would come running and they would be sure you had gone crazy and they'd send for the doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said.
<p/>Colin giggled himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could see how they would all look--how horrified by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) outbreak and how amazed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) standing upright.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish my father would come home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) myself.
<p/>I'm always thinking about it--but we couldn't go on like this much longer.
<p/>I can't stand lying still and pretending, and besides I look too different.
<p/>I wish it wasn't raining today.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>It was then Mistress Mary had her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) inspiration.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Colin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began mysteriously, <div class="bookquote">``do you know how many rooms there are in this house?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About a thousand, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's about a hundred no one ever goes into,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And one rainy day I went and looked into ever so many of them.
<p/>No one ever knew, though Mrs. Medlock nearly found me out.
<p/>I lost my way when I was coming back and I stopped at the end of your corridor.
<p/>That was the second time I heard you crying.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin started up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sofa.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A hundred rooms no one goes into,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It sounds almost like a secret garden.
<p/>Suppose we go and look at them.
<p/>Wheel me in my chair and nobody would know we went.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I was thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one would dare to follow us.
<p/>There are galleries where you could run.
<p/>We could do our exercises.
<p/>There is a little Indian room where there is a cabinet full of ivory elephants.
<p/>There are all sorts of rooms.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ring the bell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/>When the nurse came in he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) orders.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want my chair,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Mary and I are going to look at the part of the house which is not used.
<p/>John can push me as far as the picture-gallery because there are some stairs.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) must go away and leave us alone until I send for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Rainy days lost their terrors that morning.
<p/>When the footman had wheeled the chair into the picture-gallery and left the two together in obedience to orders, Colin and Mary looked at each other delighted.
<p/>As soon as Mary had made sure that John was really on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) way back to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own quarters below stairs, Colin got out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) chair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to run from one end of the gallery to the other,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and then I am going to jump and then we will do Bob Haworth's exercises.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And they did all these things and many others.
<p/>They looked at the portraits and found the plain little girl dressed in green brocade and holding the parrot on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) finger.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All these,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin, <div class="bookquote">``must be my relations.
<p/>They lived a long time ago.
<p/>That parrot one, I believe, is one of my great, great, great, great aunts.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looks rather like you, Mary--not as you look now but as you looked when you came here.
<p/>Now you are a great deal fatter and better looking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So are you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, and they both laughed.
<p/>They went to the Indian room and amused themselves with the ivory elephants.
<p/>They found the rose-colored brocade boudoir and the hole in the cushion the mouse had left, but the mice had grown up and run away and the hole was empty.
<p/>They saw more rooms and made more discoveries than Mary had made on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) first pilgrimage.
<p/>They found new corridors and corners and flights of steps and new old pictures they liked and weird old things they did not know the use of.
<p/>It was a curiously entertaining morning and the feeling of wandering about in the same house with other people but at the same time feeling as if one were miles away from them was a fascinating thing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad we came,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>Colin said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never knew I lived in such a big queer old place.
<p/>I like it.
<p/>We will ramble about every rainy day.
<p/>We shall always be finding new queer corners and things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>That morning they had found among other things such good appetites that when they returned to Colin's room it was not possible to send the luncheon away untouched.
<p/>When the nurse carried the tray down-stairs she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) slapped it down on the kitchen dresser so that Mrs. Loomis, the cook, could see the highly polished dishes and plates.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Loomis</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a house of mystery, and those two children are the greatest mysteries in it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If they keep that up every day,''  (<font color='red'><b>footman</b></font>)</div>said the strong young footman John, <div class="bookquote">``there'd be small wonder that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) weighs twice as much to-day as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did a month ago.
<p/>I should have to give up my place in time, for fear of doing my muscles an injury.''
 (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div><p/>That afternoon Mary noticed that something new had happened in Colin's room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had noticed it the day before but had said nothing because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought the change might have been made by chance.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said nothing today but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sat and looked fixedly at the picture over the mantel.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could look at it because the curtain had been drawn aside.
<p/>That was the change she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) noticed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what you want me to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had stared a few minutes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always know when you want me to tell you something.
<p/>You are wondering why the curtain is drawn back.
<p/>I am going to keep it like that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it doesn't make me angry any more to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) laughing.
<p/>I wakened when it was bright moonlight two nights ago and felt as if the Magic was filling the room and making everything so splendid that I couldn't lie still.
<p/>I got up and looked out of the window.
<p/>The room was quite light and there was a patch of moonlight on the curtain and somehow that made me go and pull the cord.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked right down at me as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were laughing because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was glad I was standing there.
<p/>It made me like to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>I want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) laughing like that all the time.
<p/>I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must have been a sort of Magic person perhaps.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are so like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``that sometimes I think perhaps you are her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ghost made into a boy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>That idea seemed to impress Colin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thought it over and then answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) slowly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ghost--my father would be fond of me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to be fond of you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>inquired Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I used to hate it because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not fond of me.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grew fond of me I think I should tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) about the Magic.
<p/>It might make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) more cheerful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXVI  <div class="bookquote">``IT'S MOTHER!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Magic</b></font>)</div><p/>Their belief in the Magic was an abiding thing.
<p/>After the morning's incantations Colin sometimes gave them Magic lectures.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like to do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``because when I grow up and make great scientific discoveries I shall be obliged to lecture about them and so this is practise.
<p/>I can only give short lectures now because I am very young, and besides Ben Weatherstaff would feel as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) were in church and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) would go to sleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Th' best thing about lecturin',''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben, <div class="bookquote">``is that a chap can get up an' say aught he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) pleases an' no other chap can answer him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) back.
<p/>I wouldn't be agen' lecturin' a bit mysel' sometimes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>But when Colin held forth under his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tree old Ben fixed devouring eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) and kept them there.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) over with critical affection.
<p/>It was not so much the lecture which interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) as the legs which looked straighter and stronger each day, the boyish head which held itself up so well, the once sharp chin and hollow cheeks which had filled and rounded out and the eyes which had begun to hold the light he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) remembered in another pair.
<p/>Sometimes when Colin felt Ben's earnest gaze meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was much impressed he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) wondered what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was reflecting on and once when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) had seemed quite entranced he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you thinking about, Ben Weatherstaff?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinkin'''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>answered Ben, <div class="bookquote">``as I'd warrant tha's, gone up three or four pound this week.
<p/>I was lookin' at tha' calves an' tha' shoulders.
<p/>I'd like to get thee on a pair o' scales.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the Magic and--and Mrs. Sowerby's buns and milk and things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see the scientific experiment has succeeded.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>That morning Dickon was too late to hear the lecture.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) came he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was ruddy with running and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) funny face looked more twinkling than usual.
<p/>As they had a good deal of weeding to do after the rains they fell to work.
<p/>They always had plenty to do after a warm deep sinking rain.
<p/>The moisture which was good for the flowers was also good for the weeds which thrust up tiny blades of grass and points of leaves which must be pulled up before their roots took too firm hold.
<p/>Colin was as good at weeding as any one in these days and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could lecture while he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was doing it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Magic works best when you work, yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said this morning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can feel it in your bones and muscles.
<p/>I am going to read books about bones and muscles, but I am going to write a book about Magic.
<p/>I am making it up now.
<p/>I keep finding out things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not very long after he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had said this that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) trowel and stood up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had been silent for several minutes and they had seen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was thinking out lectures, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) often did.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) trowel and stood upright it seemed to Mary and Dickon as if a sudden strong thought had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) do it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) stretched himself out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tallest height and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) threw out his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) arms exultantly.
<p/>Color glowed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) strange eyes widened with joyfulness.
<p/>All at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had realized something to the full.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary!
<p/>Dickon!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just look at me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>They stopped their weeding and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember that first morning you brought me in here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) demanded.
<p/>Dickon was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) very hard.
<p/>Being an animal charmer he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could see more things than most people could and many of them were things he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) never talked about.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) saw some of them now in this boy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, that we do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered.
<p/>Mary looked hard too, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said nothing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just this minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin, <div class="bookquote">``all at once I remembered it myself--when I looked at my hand digging with the trowel--and I had to stand up on my feet to see if it was real.
<p/>And it is real!
<p/>I'm well--I'm well!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, that th' art!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>said Dickon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm well!
<p/>I'm well!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>said Colin again, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face went quite red all over.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had known it before in a way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had hoped it and felt it and thought about it, but just at that minute something had rushed all through him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)--a sort of rapturous belief and realization and it had been so strong that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could not help calling out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall live forever and ever and ever!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried grandly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall find out thousands and thousands of things.
<p/>I shall find out about people and creatures and everything that grows--like Dickon--and I shall never stop making Magic.
<p/>I'm well!
<p/>I'm well!
<p/>I feel--I feel as if I want to shout out something--something thankful, joyful!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>Ben Weatherstaff, who had been working near a rose-bush, glanced round at him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' might sing th' Doxology,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) suggested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) dryest grunt.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had no opinion of the Doxology and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did not make the suggestion with any particular reverence.
<p/>But Colin was of an exploring mind and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knew nothing about the Doxology.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) inquired.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dickon can sing it for thee, I'll warrant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>replied Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>Dickon answered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) all-perceiving animal charmer's smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They sing it i' church,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) believes th' skylarks sings it when they gets up i' th' mornin'.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) says that, it must be a nice song,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>Colin answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've never been in a church myself.
<p/>I was always too ill.
<p/>Sing it, Dickon.
<p/>I want to hear it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon was quite simple and unaffected about it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) understood what Colin felt better than Colin did himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) understood by a sort of instinct so natural that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not know it was understanding.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cap and looked round still smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' must take off tha' cap,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said to Colin, <div class="bookquote">``an' so mun tha', Ben--an' tha' mun stand up, tha' knows.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cap and the sun shone on and warmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thick hair as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) watched Dickon intently.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff scrambled up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) knees and bared his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) head too with a sort of puzzled half-resentful look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) old face as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) didn't know exactly why he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was doing this remarkable thing.
<p/>Dickon stood out among the trees and rose-bushes and began to sing in quite a simple matter-of-fact way and in a nice strong boy voice:  <div class="bookquote">``Praise God from whom all blessings flow, Praise Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) all creatures here below, Praise Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) above ye Heavenly Host, Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
<p/>Amen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) had finished, Ben Weatherstaff was standing quite still with his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) jaws set obstinately but with a disturbed look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) eyes fixed on Colin.
<p/>Colin's face was thoughtful and appreciative.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a very nice song,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like it.
<p/>Perhaps it means just what I mean when I want to shout out that I am thankful to the Magic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) stopped and thought in a puzzled way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps they are both the same thing.
<p/>How can we know the exact names of everything?
<p/>Sing it again, Dickon.
<p/>Let us try, Mary.
<p/>I want to sing it, too.
<p/>It's my song.
<p/>How does it begin?
<p/>`Praise God from whom all blessings flow'?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>And they sang it again, and Mary and Colin lifted their voices as musically as they could and Dickon's swelled quite loud and beautiful--and at the second line Ben Weatherstaff raspingly cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) throat and at the third line he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) joined in with such vigor that it seemed almost savage and when the <div class="bookquote">``Amen''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>came to an end Mary observed that the very same thing had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) which had happened when he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) found out that Colin was not a cripple--his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) chin was twitching and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was staring and winking and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) leathery old cheeks were wet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never seed no sense in th' Doxology afore,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said hoarsely, <div class="bookquote">``but I may change my mind i' time.
<p/>I should say tha'd gone up five pound this week Mester Colin--five on 'em!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin was looking across the garden at something attracting his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) attention and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) expression had become a startled one.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is coming in here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said quickly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The door in the ivied wall had been pushed gently open and a woman had entered.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had come in with the last line of their song and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had stood still listening and looking at them.
<p/>With the ivy behind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), the sunlight drifting through the trees and dappling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) long blue cloak, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nice fresh face smiling across the greenery she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was rather like a softly colored illustration in one of Colin's books.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had wonderful affectionate eyes which seemed to take everything in--all of them, even Ben Weatherstaff and the <div class="bookquote">``creatures''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>and every flower that was in bloom.
<p/>Unexpectedly as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had appeared, not one of them felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was an intruder at all.
<p/>Dickon's eyes lighted like lamps.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's mother--that's who it is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) cried and went across the grass at a run.
<p/>Colin began to move toward her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), too, and Mary went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>They both felt their pulses beat faster.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's mother!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickon said again when they met halfway.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knowed tha' wanted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) an' I told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) where th' door was hid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Colin held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand with a sort of flushed royal shyness but his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes quite devoured her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Even when I was ill I wanted to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you and Dickon and the secret garden.
<p/>I'd never wanted to see any one or anything before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) uplifted face brought about a sudden change in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) flushed and the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mouth shook and a mist seemed to sweep over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>dear lad!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) broke out tremulously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>dear lad!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had not known she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were going to say it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not say, <div class="bookquote">``Mester Colin,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>but just <div class="bookquote">``dear lad''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>quite suddenly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might have said it to Dickon in the same way if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had seen something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face which touched her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>Colin liked it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you surprised because I am so well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) asked.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) shoulder and smiled the mist out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, that I am!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but tha`rt so like thy mother tha' made my heart jump.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin a little awkwardly, <div class="bookquote">``that will make my father like me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, for sure, dear lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) shoulder a soft quick pat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mun come home--he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mun come home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Susan Sowerby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben Weatherstaff, getting close to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at th' lad's legs, wilt tha'?
<p/>They was like drumsticks i' stockin' two month' ago--an' I heard folk tell as they was bandy an' knock-kneed both at th' same time.
<p/>Look at 'em now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Susan Sowerby/Susan</b></font>)</div><p/>Susan Sowerby laughed a comfortable laugh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're goin' to be fine strong lad's legs in a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) go on playin' an' workin' in the garden an' eatin' hearty an' drinkin' plenty o' good sweet milk an' there'll not be a finer pair i' Yorkshire, thank God for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) put both hands on Mistress Mary's shoulders and looked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) little face over in a motherly fashion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' thee, too!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha`rt grown near as hearty as our `Lisabeth Ellen.
<p/>I'll warrant tha`rt like thy mother too.
<p/>Our Martha told me as Mrs. Medlock heard she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was a pretty woman.
<p/>Tha`lt be like a blush rose when tha' grows up, my little lass, bless thee.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) did not mention that when Martha came home on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``day out''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>and described the plain sallow child she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had no confidence whatever in what Mrs. Medlock had heard.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't stand to reason that a pretty woman could be th' mother o' such a fou' little lass,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) had added obstinately.
<p/>Mary had not had time to pay much attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) changing face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had only known that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked <div class="bookquote">``different''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and seemed to have a great deal more hair and that it was growing very fast.
<p/>But remembering her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pleasure in looking at the Mem Sahib in the past she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was glad to hear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might some day look like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>Susan Sowerby went round their garden with them and was told the whole story of it and shown every bush and tree which had come alive.
<p/>Colin walked on one side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and Mary on the other.
<p/>Each of them kept looking up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) comfortable rosy face, secretly curious about the delightful feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gave them--a sort of warm, supported feeling.
<p/>It seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) understood them as Dickon understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``creatures.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stooped over the flowers and talked about them as if they were children.
<p/>Soot followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and once or twice cawed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and flew upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) shoulder as if it were Dickon's.
<p/>When they told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) about the robin and the first flight of the young ones she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) laughed a motherly little mellow laugh in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) throat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose learnin' 'em to fly is like learnin' children to walk, but I'm feared I should be all in a worrit if mine had wings instead o' legs,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>It was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) seemed such a wonderful woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) nice moorland cottage way that at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was told about the Magic.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you believe in Magic?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Colin after he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had explained about Indian fakirs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do hope you do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I do, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never knowed it by that name but what does th' name matter?
<p/>I warrant they call it a different name i' France an' a different one i' Germany.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I felt so joyful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) beautiful strange eyes at her (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suddenly I felt how different I was--how strong my arms and legs were, you know--and how I could dig and stand--and I jumped up and wanted to shout out something to anything that would listen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Th' Magic listened when tha' sung th' Doxology.

<p/>Eh!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) had packed a basket which held a regular feast this morning, and when the hungry hour came and Dickon brought it out from its hiding place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) sat down with them under their tree and watched them devour their food, laughing and quite gloating over their appetites.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) was full of fun and made them laugh at all sorts of odd things.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) told them stories in broad Yorkshire and taught them new words.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) laughed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) could not help it when they told her (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) of the increasing difficulty there was in pretending that Colin was still a fretful invalid.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see we can't help laughing nearly all the time when we are together,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>explained Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it doesn't sound ill at all.

 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Susan Sowerby/Susan</b></font>)</div><p/>Susan Sowerby chuckled softly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it `ud nigh break thy heart if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) found out before tha' told him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) in tha' own way,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mun come back--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mun.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>One of the things they talked of was the visit they were to make to her (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cottage.
<p/>They planned it all.
<p/>They were to drive over the moor and lunch out of doors among the heather.
<p/>They would see all the twelve children and Dickon's garden and would not come back until they were tired.
<p/>Susan Sowerby got up at last to return to the house and Mrs. Medlock.
<p/>It was time for Colin to be wheeled back also.
<p/>But before he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) got into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) chair he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) stood quite close to Susan and fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) with a kind of bewildered adoration and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) suddenly caught hold of the fold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) blue cloak and held it fast.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are just what I--what I wanted,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you were my mother--as well as Dickon's!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Susan Sowerby/Susan</b></font>)</div><p/>All at once Susan Sowerby bent down and drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) warm arms close against the bosom under the blue cloak--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had been Dickon's brother.
<p/>The quick mist swept over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>dear lad!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thy own mother's in this `ere very garden, I do believe.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) couldna' keep out of it.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXVII  IN THE GARDEN   In each century since the beginning of the world wonderful things have been discovered.
<p/>In the last century more amazing things were found out than in any century before.
<p/>In this new century hundreds of things still more astounding will be brought to light.
<p/>At first people refuse to believe that a strange new thing can be done, then they begin to hope it can be done, then they see it can be done--then it is done and all the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago.
<p/>One of the new things people began to find out in the last century was that thoughts--just mere thoughts--are as powerful as electric batteries--as good for one as sunlight is, or as bad for one as poison.
<p/>To let a sad thought or a bad one get into your mind is as dangerous as letting a scarlet fever germ get into your body.
<p/>If you let it stay there after it has got in you may never get over it as long as you live.
<p/>So long as Mistress Mary's mind was full of disagreeable thoughts about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dislikes and sour opinions of people and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) determination not to be pleased by or interested in anything, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a yellow-faced, sickly, bored and wretched child.
<p/>Circumstances, however, were very kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not at all aware of it.
<p/>They began to push her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) about for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own good.
<p/>When her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind gradually filled itself with robins, and moorland cottages crowded with children, with queer crabbed old gardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids, with springtime and with secret gardens coming alive day by day, and also with a moor boy and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``creatures,''  (<font color='red'><b>a moor boy creatures</b></font>)</div>there was no room left for the disagreeable thoughts which affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liver and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) digestion and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) yellow and tired.
<p/>So long as Colin shut himself up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) room and thought only of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) fears and weakness and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) detestation of people who looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) and reflected hourly on humps and early death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was a hysterical half-crazy little hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine and the spring and also did not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could get well and could stand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feet if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tried to do it.
<p/>When new beautiful thoughts began to push out the old hideous ones, life began to come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) blood ran healthily through his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) veins and strength poured into him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) like a flood.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) scientific experiment was quite practical and simple and there was nothing weird about it at all.
<p/>Much more surprising things can happen to any one who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought comes into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mind, just has the sense to remember in time and push it out by putting in an agreeable determinedly courageous one.
<p/>Two things cannot be in one place.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where, you tend a rose, my lad, A thistle cannot grow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div><p/>While the secret garden was coming alive and two children were coming alive with it, there was a man wandering about certain far-away beautiful places in the Norwegian fiords and the valleys and mountains of Switzerland and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a man who for ten years had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind filled with dark and heart-broken thinking.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not been courageous; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never tried to put any other thoughts in the place of the dark ones.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had wandered by blue lakes and thought them; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lain on mountain-sides with sheets of deep blue gentians blooming all about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and flower breaths filling all the air and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had thought them.
<p/>A terrible sorrow had fallen upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been happy and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had let his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul fill itself with blackness and had refused obstinately to allow any rift of light to pierce through.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had forgotten and deserted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duties.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) traveled about, darkness so brooded over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a wrong done to other people because it was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) poisoned the air about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with gloom.
<p/>Most strangers thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be either half mad or a man with some hidden crime on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), was a tall man with a drawn face and crooked shoulders and the name he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always entered on hotel registers was, <div class="bookquote">``Archibald Craven, Misselthwaite Manor, Yorkshire, England.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had traveled far and wide since the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) saw Mistress Mary in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) study and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) might have her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``bit of earth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had been in the most beautiful places in Europe, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had remained nowhere more than a few days.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had chosen the quietest and remotest spots.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had been on the tops of mountains whose heads were in the clouds and had looked down on other mountains when the sun rose and touched them with such light as made it seem as if the world were just being born.
<p/>But the light had never seemed to touch himself until one day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) realized that for the first time in ten years a strange thing had happened.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was in a wonderful valley in the Austrian Tyrol and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had been walking alone through such beauty as might have lifted, any man's soul out of shadow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had walked a long way and it had not lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>But at last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had felt tired and had thrown himself down to rest on a carpet of moss by a stream.
<p/>It was a clear little stream which ran quite merrily along on its narrow way through the luscious damp greenness.
<p/>Sometimes it made a sound rather like very low laughter as it bubbled over and round stones.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw birds come and dip their heads to drink in it and then flick their wings and fly away.
<p/>It seemed like a thing alive and yet its tiny voice made the stillness seem deeper.
<p/>The valley was very, very still.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat gazing into the clear running of the water, Archibald Craven gradually felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) mind and body both grow quiet, as quiet as the valley itself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) were going to sleep, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was not.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) sat and gazed at the sunlit water and his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) eyes began to see things growing at its edge.
<p/>There was one lovely mass of blue forget-me-nots growing so close to the stream that its leaves were wet and at these he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) found himself looking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) remembered he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had looked at such things years ago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and what wonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) did not know that just that simple thought was slowly filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) mind--filling and filling it until other things were softly pushed aside.
<p/>It was as if a sweet clear spring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had risen and risen until at last it swept the dark water away.
<p/>But of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) did not think of this himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) only knew that the valley seemed to grow quieter and quieter as he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) sat and stared at the bright delicate blueness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) did not know how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) sat there or what was happening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>), but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) moved as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) were awakening and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) got up slowly and stood on the moss carpet, drawing a long, deep, soft breath and wondering at himself.
<p/>Something seemed to have been unbound and released in him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>), very quietly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said, almost in a whisper, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) forehead.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I almost feel as if--I were alive!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered things to be able to explain how this had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).
<p/>Neither does any one else yet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) did not understand at all himself--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) remembered this strange hour months afterward when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was at Misselthwaite again and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) found out quite by accident that on this very day Colin had cried out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) went into the secret garden:  <div class="bookquote">``I am going to live forever and ever and ever!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The singular calmness remained with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) the rest of the evening and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) slept a new reposeful sleep; but it was not with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) very long.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not know that it could be kept.
<p/>By the next night he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had opened the doors wide to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) dark thoughts and they had come trooping and rushing back.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) left the valley and went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wandering way again.
<p/>But, strange as it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), there were minutes--sometimes half-hours--when, without his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knowing why, the black burden seemed to lift itself again and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was a living man and not a dead one.
<p/>Slowly--slowly--for no reason that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knew of--he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``coming alive''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with the garden.
<p/>As the golden summer changed into the deep golden autumn he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) went to the Lake of Como.
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) found the loveliness of a dream.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) days upon the crystal blueness of the lake or he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) walked back into the soft thick verdure of the hills and tramped until he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was tired so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) might sleep.
<p/>But by this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had begun to sleep better, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knew, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) dreams had ceased to be a terror to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``my body is growing stronger.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was growing stronger but--because of the rare peaceful hours when his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thoughts were changed--his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) soul was slowly growing stronger, too.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) began to think of Misselthwaite and wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) should not go home.
<p/>Now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wondered vaguely about his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) boy and asked himself what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) should feel when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) went and stood by the carved four-posted bed again and looked down at the sharply chiseled ivory-white face while it slept and, the black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close-shut eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) shrank from it.
<p/>One marvel of a day he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had walked so far that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) returned the moon was high and full and all the world was purple shadow and silver.
<p/>The stillness of lake and shore and wood was so wonderful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not go into the villa he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lived in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) walked down to a little bowered terrace at the water's edge and sat upon a seat and breathed in all the heavenly scents of the night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) felt the strange calmness stealing over him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) and it grew deeper and deeper until he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) fell asleep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not know when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) fell asleep and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) began to dream; his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) dream was so real that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not feel as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) were dreaming.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) remembered afterward how intensely wide awake and alert he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thought that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sat and breathed in the scent of the late roses and listened to the lapping of the water at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feet he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) heard a voice calling.
<p/>It was sweet and clear and happy and far away.
<p/>It seemed very far, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) heard it as distinctly as if it had been at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) very side.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Archie!
<p/>Archie!
<p/>Archie!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>it said, and then again, sweeter and clearer than before, <div class="bookquote">``Archie!
<p/>Archie!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) feet not even startled.
<p/>It was such a real voice and it seemed so natural that he (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) should hear it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lilias!
<p/>Lilias!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lilias!
<p/>where are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it came back like a sound from a golden flute.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the garden!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And then the dream ended.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) did not awaken.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) slept soundly and sweetly all through the lovely night.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) did awake at last it was brilliant morning and a servant was standing staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was an Italian servant and was accustomed, as all the servants of the villa were, to accepting without question any strange thing his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) foreign master might do.
<p/>No one ever knew when he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would go out or come in or where he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would choose to sleep or if he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would roam about the garden or lie in the boat on the lake all night.
<p/>The man held a salver with some letters on it and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waited quietly until Mr. Craven took them.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had gone away Mr. Craven sat a few moments holding them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) hand and looking at the lake.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) strange calm was still upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) and something more--a lightness as if the cruel thing which had been done had not happened as he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) thought--as if something had changed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was remembering the dream--the real--real dream.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the garden!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said, wondering at himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the garden!
<p/>But the door is locked and the key is buried deep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) glanced at the letters a few minutes later he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) saw that the one lying at the top of the rest was an English letter and came from Yorkshire.
<p/>It was directed in a plain woman's hand but it was not a hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) knew.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) opened it, scarcely thinking of the writer, but the first words attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) attention at once.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Sir:  I am Susan Sowerby that made bold to speak to you once on the moor.
<p/>It was about Miss Mary I spoke.
<p/>I will make bold to speak again.
<p/>Please, sir, I would come home if I was you.
<p/>I think you would be glad to come and--if you will excuse me, sir--I think your lady would ask you to come if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was here.
<p/>Your obedient servant, Susan Sowerby.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Craven/Mr. Archibald Craven/Archibald Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Craven read the letter twice before he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) put it back in its envelope.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) kept thinking about the dream.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go back to Misselthwaite,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'll go at once.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) went through the garden to the villa and ordered Pitcher to prepare for his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) return to England.
<p/>In a few days he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was in Yorkshire again, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) long railroad journey he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) found himself thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) boy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had never thought in all the ten years past.
<p/>During those years he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had only wished to forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).
<p/>Now, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) did not intend to think about him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>), memories of him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) constantly drifted into his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) remembered the black days when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had raved like a madman because the child was alive and the mother was dead.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had refused to see it, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had gone to look at it at last it had been, such a weak wretched thing that everyone had been sure it would die in a few days.
<p/>But to the surprise of those who took care of it the days passed and it lived and then everyone believed it would be a deformed and crippled creature.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had not meant to be a bad father, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had not felt like a father at all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had supplied doctors and nurses and luxuries, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had shrunk from the mere thought of the boy and had buried himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) own misery.
<p/>The first time after a year's absence he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) returned to Misselthwaite and the small miserable looking thing languidly and indifferently lifted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) face the great gray eyes with black lashes round them, so like and yet so horribly unlike the happy eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had adored, he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) could not bear the sight of them and turned away pale as death.
<p/>After that he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) scarcely ever saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) except when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was asleep, and all he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) knew of him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was a confirmed invalid, with a vicious, hysterical, half-insane temper.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) could only be kept from furies dangerous to himself by being given his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) own way in every detail.
<p/>All this was not an uplifting thing to recall, but as the train whirled him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) through mountain passes and golden plains the man who was <div class="bookquote">``coming alive''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>began to think in a new way and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought long and steadily and deeply.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I have been all wrong for ten years,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten years is a long time.
<p/>It may be too late to do anything--quite too late.
<p/>What have I been thinking of!''
 (<font color='red'><b>this the Magic</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course this was the wrong Magic--to begin by saying <div class="bookquote">``too late.''
 (<font color='red'><b>this the Magic</b></font>)</div><p/>Even Colin could have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) that.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knew nothing of Magic--either black or white.
<p/>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had yet to learn.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wondered if Susan Sowerby had taken courage and written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) only because the motherly creature had realized that the boy was much worse--was fatally ill.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had not been under the spell of the curious calmness which had taken possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would have been more wretched than ever.
<p/>But the calm had brought a sort of courage and hope with it.
<p/>Instead of giving way to thoughts of the worst he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) actually found he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was trying to believe in better things.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Could it be possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>creature</b></font>) sees that I may be able to do him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) good and control him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>creature</b></font>) on my way to Misselthwaite.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But when on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) way across the moor he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stopped the carriage at the cottage, seven or eight children who were playing about gathered in a group and bobbing seven or eight friendly and polite curtsies told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that their mother had gone to the other side of the moor early in the morning to help a woman who had a new baby.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our Dickon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>they volunteered, was over at the Manor working in one of the gardens where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went several days each week.
<p/>Mr. Craven looked over the collection of sturdy little bodies and round red-cheeked faces, each one grinning in its own particular way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) awoke to the fact that they were a healthy likable lot.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) smiled at their friendly grins and took a golden sovereign from his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) pocket and gave it to <div class="bookquote">``our `Lizabeth Ellen''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>who was the oldest.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you divide that into eight parts there will be half a crown for each of, you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said.
<p/>Then amid grins and chuckles and bobbing of curtsies he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) drove away, leaving ecstasy and nudging elbows and little jumps of joy behind.
<p/>The drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was a soothing thing.
<p/>Why did it seem to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) a sense of homecoming which he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had been sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) could never feel again--that sense of the beauty of land and sky and purple bloom of distance and a warming of the heart at drawing, nearer to the great old house which had held those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) blood for six hundred years?
<p/>How he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had driven away from it the last time, shuddering to think of its closed rooms and the boy lying in the four-posted bed with the brocaded hangings.
<p/>Was it possible that perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might find him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) changed a little for the better and that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shrinking from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?
<p/>How real that dream had been--how wonderful and clear the voice which called back to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``In the garden--In the garden!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will try to find the key,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will try to open the door.
<p/>I must--though I don't know why.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arrived at the Manor the servants who received him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with the usual ceremony noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked better and that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did not go to the remote rooms where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) usually lived attended by Pitcher.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went into the library and sent for Mrs. Medlock.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) came to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) somewhat excited and curious and flustered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is Master Colin, Medlock?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) inquired.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Medlock answered, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s--he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s different, in a manner of speaking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Worse?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) suggested.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock really was flushed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you see, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) tried to explain, <div class="bookquote">``neither Dr. Craven, nor the nurse, nor me can exactly make him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To tell the truth, sir, Master Colin might be better and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) might be changing for the worse.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) appetite, sir, is past understanding--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) ways--''   (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) become more--more peculiar?''
 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) master, asked, knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) brows anxiously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it, sir.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s growing very peculiar--when you compare him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) used to be.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) used to eat nothing and then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) began to eat something enormous--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) stopped again all at once and the meals were sent back just as they used to be.
<p/>You never knew, sir, perhaps, that out of doors he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) never would let himself be taken.
<p/>The things we've gone through to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) to go out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) chair would leave a body trembling like a leaf.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'d throw himself into such a state that Dr. Craven said he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) couldn't be responsible for forcing him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).
<p/>Well, sir, just without warning--not long after one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) worst tantrums he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) suddenly insisted on being taken out every day by Miss Mary and Susan Sowerby's boy Dickon that could push his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took a fancy to both Miss Mary and Dickon, and Dickon brought his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tame animals, and, if you'll credit it, sir, out of doors he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will stay from morning until night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How does he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) look?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>was the next question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) food natural, sir, you'd think he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was putting on flesh--but we're afraid it may be a sort of bloat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) laughs sometimes in a queer way when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s alone with Miss Mary.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) never used to laugh at all.
<p/>Dr. Craven is coming to see you at once, if you'll allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) never was as puzzled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) life.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Master Colin now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Craven/Mr. Archibald Craven/Archibald Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Craven asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the garden, sir.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s always in the garden--though not a human creature is allowed to go near for fear they'll look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Craven/Mr. Archibald Craven/Archibald Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Craven scarcely heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) last words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said, and after he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had sent Mrs. Medlock away he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) stood and repeated it again and again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the garden!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had to make an effort to bring himself back to the place he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was standing in and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was on earth again he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) turned and went out of the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) way, as Mary had done, through the door in the shrubbery and among the laurels and the fountain beds.
<p/>The fountain was playing now and was encircled by beds of brilliant autumn flowers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) crossed the lawn and turned into the Long Walk by the ivied walls.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) did not walk quickly, but slowly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) eyes were on the path.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) were being drawn back to the place he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) had so long forsaken, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) did not know why.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) drew near to it his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) step became still more slow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) knew where the door was even though the ivy hung thick over it--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) did not know exactly where it lay--that buried key.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) stopped and stood still, looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>), and almost the moment after he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) had paused he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) started and listened--asking himself if he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) were walking in a dream.
<p/>The ivy hung thick over the door, the key was buried under the shrubs, no human being had passed that portal for ten lonely years--and yet inside the garden there were sounds.
<p/>They were the sounds of running scuffling feet seeming to chase round and round under the trees, they were strange sounds of lowered suppressed voices--exclamations and smothered joyous cries.
<p/>It seemed actually like the laughter of young things, the uncontrollable laughter of children who were trying not to be heard but who in a moment or so--as their excitement mounted--would burst forth.
<p/>What in heaven's name was he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) dreaming of--what in heaven's name did he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hear?
<p/>Was he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) losing his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) reason and thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) heard things which were not for human ears?
<p/>Was it that the far clear voice had meant?
<p/>And then the moment came, the uncontrollable moment when the sounds forgot to hush themselves.
<p/>The feet ran faster and faster--they were nearing the garden door--there was quick strong young breathing and a wild outbreak of laughing shows which could not be contained--and the door in the wall was flung wide open, the sheet of ivy swinging back, and a boy burst through it at full speed and, without seeing the outsider, dashed almost into his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) arms.
<p/>Mr. Craven had extended them just in time to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) from falling as a result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) unseeing dash against him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>), and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) held him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) away to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) in amazement at his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) being there he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) truly gasped for breath.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was a tall boy and a handsome one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was glowing with life and his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) running had sent splendid color leaping to his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) threw the thick hair back from his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) forehead and lifted a pair of strange gray eyes--eyes full of boyish laughter and rimmed with black lashes like a fringe.
<p/>It was the eyes which made Mr. Craven gasp for breath.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who--What?
<p/>Who!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) stammered.
<p/>This was not what Colin had expected--this was not what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had planned.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had never thought of such a meeting.
<p/>And yet to come dashing out--winning a race--perhaps it was even better.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) drew himself up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) very tallest.
<p/>Mary, who had been running with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) and had dashed through the door too, believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) managed to make himself look taller than he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had ever looked before--inches taller.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm Colin.
<p/>You can't believe it.
<p/>I scarcely can myself.
<p/>I'm Colin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Like Mrs. Medlock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not understand what his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) father meant when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said hurriedly:  <div class="bookquote">``In the garden!
<p/>In the garden!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>hurried on Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was the garden that did it--and Mary and Dickon and the creatures--and the Magic.
<p/>No one knows.
<p/>We kept it to tell you when you came.
<p/>I'm well, I can beat Mary in a race.
<p/>I'm going to be an athlete.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>athlete</b></font>) said it all so like a healthy boy--his (<font color='blue'><b>athlete</b></font>) face flushed, his (<font color='blue'><b>athlete</b></font>) words tumbling over each other in his (<font color='blue'><b>athlete</b></font>) eagerness--that Mr. Craven's soul shook with unbelieving joy.
<p/>Colin put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand and laid it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) father's arm.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you glad, Father?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) ended.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you glad?
<p/>I'm going to live forever and ever and ever!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Craven/Mr. Archibald Craven/Archibald Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Craven put his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) hands on both the boy's shoulders and held him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) still.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) dared not even try to speak for a moment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take me into the garden, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said at last.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And tell me all about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And so they led him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in.
<p/>The place was a wilderness of autumn gold and purple and violet blue and flaming scarlet and on every side were sheaves of late lilies standing together--lilies which were white or white and ruby.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) remembered well when the first of them had been planted that just at this season of the year their late glories should reveal themselves.
<p/>Late roses climbed and hung and clustered and the sunshine deepening the hue of the yellowing trees made one feel that one, stood in an embowered temple of gold.
<p/>The newcomer stood silent just as the children had done when they came into its grayness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) looked round and round.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it would be dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary thought so at first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it came alive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/Mester</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they sat down under their tree--all but Colin, who wanted to stand while he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) told the story.
<p/>It was the strangest thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had ever heard, Archibald Craven thought, as it was poured forth in headlong boy fashion.
<p/>Mystery and Magic and wild creatures, the weird midnight meeting--the coming of the spring--the passion of insulted pride which had dragged the young Rajah to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) feet to defy old Ben Weatherstaff to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) face.
<p/>The odd companionship, the play acting, the great secret so carefully kept.
<p/>The listener laughed until tears came into his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) eyes and sometimes tears came into his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) eyes when he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) was not laughing.
<p/>The Athlete, the Lecturer, the Scientific Discoverer was a laughable, lovable, healthy young human thing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Athlete</b></font>) said at the end of the story, <div class="bookquote">``it need not be a secret any more.
<p/>I dare say it will frighten them nearly into fits when they see me--but I am never going to get into the chair again.
<p/>I shall walk back with you, Father--to the house.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Ben Weatherstaff's duties rarely took him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) away from the gardens, but on this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) made an excuse to carry some vegetables to the kitchen and being invited into the servants' hall by Mrs. Medlock to drink a glass of beer he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was on the spot--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had hoped to be--when the most dramatic event Misselthwaite Manor had seen during the present generation actually took place.
<p/>One of the windows looking upon the courtyard gave also a glimpse of the lawn.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock, knowing Ben had come from the gardens, hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) might have caught sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) master and even by chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) meeting with Master Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you see either of them, Weatherstaff?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) asked.
<p/>Ben took his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) beer-mug from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) mouth and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) lips with the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, that I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) answered with a shrewdly significant air.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Both of them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div><p/>suggested Mrs. Medlock.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Both of 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>returned Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank ye kindly, ma'am, I could sup up another mug of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Together?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mrs. Medlock, hastily overfilling his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) beer-mug in her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) excitement.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Together, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>and Ben gulped down half of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) new mug at one gulp.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where was Master Colin?
<p/>How did he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) look?
<p/>What did they say to each other?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didna' hear that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben, <div class="bookquote">``along o' only bein' on th' stepladder lookin, over th' wall.
<p/>But I'll tell thee this.
<p/>There's been things goin' on outside as you house people knows nowt about.
<p/>An' what tha'll find out tha'll find out soon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div><p/>And it was not two minutes before he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) swallowed the last of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) beer and waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) mug solemnly toward the window which took in through the shrubbery a piece of the lawn.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if tha's curious.
<p/>Look what's comin' across th' grass.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When Mrs. Medlock looked she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) threw up her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) hands and gave a little shriek and every man and woman servant within hearing bolted across the servants' hall and stood looking through the window with their eyes almost starting out of their heads.
<p/>Across the lawn came the Master of Misselthwaite and he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) looked as many of them had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>).
<p/>And by his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>), side with his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) head up in the air and his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) eyes full of laughter walked as strongly and steadily as any boy in Yorkshire--Master Colin.
