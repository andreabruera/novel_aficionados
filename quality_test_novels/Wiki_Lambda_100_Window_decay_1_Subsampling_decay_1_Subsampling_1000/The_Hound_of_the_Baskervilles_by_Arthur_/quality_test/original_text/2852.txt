sir charles was found dead on the grounds of his devonshire estate baskerville hall
mortimer now fears for sir charles nephew and sole heir sir henry baskerville who is the new master of baskerville hall
the death was attributed to heart attack but mortimer is suspicious because sir charles died with an expression of horror on his face and mortimer noticed the footprints of gigantic hound about yards from where sir charles lay dead
the baskerville family has supposedly been under curse since the era of the english civil war when ancestor hugo baskerville allegedly offered his soul to the devil for help in abducting woman and was reportedly killed by giant spectral hound
sir charles believed in the curse and was apparently fleeing from something in fright when he died
intrigued holmes meets with sir henry newly arrived from canada
sir henry has received an anonymous note cut and pasted from newsprint warning him away from the baskerville moors and one of his new boots is inexplicably missing from his london hotel room
the baskerville family is discussed sir charles was the eldest of three brothers the youngest black sheep rodger is believed to have died childless in south america while sir henry is the only child of the middle brother
sir henry plans to move into baskerville hall despite the ominous warning message
holmes and dr watson follow him from holmes baker street apartment back to his hotel and notice bearded man following him in cab they pursue the man but he escapes
mortimer tells them that mr barrymore the butler at baskerville hall has beard like the one on the stranger
sir henry boot reappears but an older one vanishes

holmes see the clue in the baskerville portrait
holmes sends for the cab driver who shuttled the bearded man after sir henry and is both astounded and amused to learn that the stranger had made point of giving his name as sherlock holmes to the cabbie
holmes now even more interested in the baskerville affair but held up with other cases dispatches watson to accompany sir henry to baskerville hall with instructions to send him frequent reports about the house grounds and neighbours
upon arrival at the grand but austere baskerville estate watson and sir henry learn that an escaped murderer named selden is believed to be in the area
barrymore and his wife who also works at baskerville hall wish to leave the estate soon
watson hears woman crying in the night it is obvious to him that it was mrs barrymore but her husband denies it
watson can find no proof that barrymore was in devon on the day of the chase in london
he meets brother and sister who live nearby mr stapleton naturalist and the beautiful miss stapleton
when an animal sound is heard stapleton is quick to dismiss it as unrelated to the legendary hound
when her brother is out of earshot miss stapleton mistakes watson for sir henry and warns him to leave
she and sir henry later meet and quickly fall in love arousing stapleton anger he later apologises and invites sir henry to dine with him few days later
barrymore arouses further suspicion when watson and sir henry catch him at night with candle in an empty room
barrymore refuses to answer their questions but mrs barrymore confesses that selden is her brother and her husband is signalling that they have left supplies for him
watson and sir henry pursue selden on the moor but he eludes them while watson notices another man on nearby tor
after an agreement is reached to allow selden to flee the country barrymore reveals the contents of an incompletely burnt letter asking sir charles to be at the gate at the time of his death
it was signed with the initials l
on mortimer advice watson questions laura lyons who admits to writing the letter in hopes that sir charles would help finance her divorce but says she did not keep the appointment
watson tracks the second man he saw in the area and discovers it to be holmes investigating independently in hopes of faster resolution
holmes reveals further information stapleton is actually married to the supposed miss stapleton and he promised marriage to laura lyons to get her cooperation
they hear scream and discover the body of selden dead from fall
they initially mistake him for sir henry whose old clothes he was wearing
at baskerville hall holmes notices resemblance between stapleton and portrait of hugo baskerville
he realises that stapleton could be an unknown baskerville family member seeking to claim the baskerville wealth by eliminating his relatives
reasuring sir henry to keep dinner date with the stapletons holmes and watson pretend to travel to london but in fact they interview laura lyons who is angered when she learns the truth of the stapletons she confirms that it was stapleton who thrice tricked her first into writing the fatal letter to sir charles and then not keeping the appoiment and lastly not revealing it was stapleton idea
accompanied by inspector lestrade whom holmes has summoned holmes and watson travel to the stapleton home where sir henry is dining
they rescue him from hound that stapleton releases while sir henry is walking home across the moor
shooting the animal dead in the struggle sherlock reveals that it was perfectly mortal dog mix of bloodhound and mastiff painted with phosphorus to give it hellish appearance
they find miss stapleton bound and gagged inside the house while stapleton apparently dies in an attempt to reach his hideout in nearby mine located at the heart of the grimpen mire
they also find sir henry boot which was used to give the hound sir henry scent
weeks later holmes provides watson with additional details about the case
from the unsigned note holmes noticed woman perfume
from the appearance and disappearance of baskervilles boots holmes deduces that the hound is not ghost but real
jack stapleton was in fact rodger baskerville son also named rodger and was physical and moral throwback to hugo baskerville
his now widow is south american woman the former beryl garcia
he supported himself through crime for many years first by fleeing central america after his marriage when he stole considerable amount of public money in at yorkshire he used the money to open public school however the tutor he had hired to make the school success died of consumption baskerville then tried to use the school to teach his pupils crime which was struck by an epidemic which killed three students he was compelled to close the school in
he took the remains of his fortune his wife and his taste for entomology in which he was an expert to his ancestorial home in devonshire although holmes cannot prove it he believes that baskerville supported himself by engaging in several bulgaries and one murder before learning that he could inherit fortune by murdering his uncle and cousin
stapleton had taken sir henry old boot because the new unworn boot lacked his scent
the hound had pursued selden to his death because of the scent on sir henry old clothes
mrs stapleton had disavowed her husband plot so he had imprisoned her to prevent her from interfering
holmes pays stapleton backhanded compliment as man who for years has been one of the most dangerous and desperate persons holmes has ever come across
the story ends with holmes and watson leaving to see the opera les huguenots starring jean de reszke
baskerville hall formally clyro court
it is thought this house may have provided conan doyle with the inspiration for the hound of the baskervilles
the ruins of fowelscombe house viewed in possible model for baskerville hall
sir arthur conan doyle wrote this story shortly after returning to his home undershaw from south africa where he had worked as volunteer physician at the langman field hospital in bloemfontein at the time of the second boer war
conan doyle had not written about sherlock holmes in eight years having killed off the character in the story the final problem
although the hound of the baskervilles is set before the latter events two years later conan doyle would bring holmes back for good explaining in the adventure of the empty house that holmes had faked his own death
he was assisted with the plot by year old daily express journalist named bertram fletcher robinson
his ideas came from the legend of richard cabell of brook hall in the parish of buckfastleigh devon which was the fundamental inspiration for the baskerville tale of hellish hound and cursed country squire
cabell tomb survives in the village of buckfastleigh
squire richard cabell lived for hunting and was what in those days was described as monstrously evil man
he gained this reputation for amongst other things immorality and having sold his soul to the devil
there was also rumour that he had murdered his wife elizabeth fowell daughter of sir edmund fowell st baronet of fowelscombe
on july he died and was laid to rest in the sepulchre
the night of his interment saw phantom pack of hounds come baying across the moor to howl at his tomb
from that night on he could be found leading the phantom pack across the moor usually on the anniversary of his death
if the pack were not out hunting they could be found ranging around his grave howling and shrieking
in an attempt to lay the soul to rest the villagers built large building around the tomb and to be doubly sure huge slab was placed
moreover devon folklore includes tales of fearsome supernatural dog known as the yeth hound that conan doyle may have heard
it is believed by weller that baskerville hall is based on one of three possible houses on or near dartmoor namely fowelscombe in the parish of ugborough the seat of the fowell baronets hayford hall near buckfastleigh also owned by john king of fowelscombe and brook hall in the parish of buckfastleigh about two miles east of hayford the actual home of richard cabell husband of elizabeth fowell
it has also been claimed that baskerville hall is based on property in mid wales built in by one thomas mynors baskerville
the house was formerly named clyro court and was renamed baskerville hall towards the end of the last century
arthur conan doyle was apparently family friend who often stayed there and may have been aware of local legend of the hound of the baskervilles
still other tales claim that conan doyle was inspired by his time on holiday in north norfolk where the tale of black shuck is well known
the pre gothic cromer hall where conan doyle stayed also closely resembles doyle vivid descriptions of baskerville hall
james lynam molloy friend of doyle and author of love old sweet song married florence baskerville daughter of henry baskerville of crowsley park oxfordshire
the gates to the park had statues of hell hounds spears through their mouths
above the lintel there was another statue of hell hound
in doyle original manuscript of the book was broken up into individual leaves as part of promotional campaign by doyle american publisher they were used as part of window displays by individual booksellers
out of an estimated leaves only are known to still exist including all the leaves from chapter held by the new york public library
other leaves are owned by university libraries and private collectors
