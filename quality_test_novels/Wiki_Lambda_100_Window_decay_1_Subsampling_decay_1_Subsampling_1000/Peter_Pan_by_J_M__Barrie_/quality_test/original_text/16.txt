peter pan or the boy who wouldn grow up or peter and wendy is m barrie most famous work in the form of play and novel
both versions tell the story of peter pan mischievous yet innocent little boy who can fly and has many adventures on the island of neverland that is inhabited by mermaids fairies native americans and pirates
the peter pan stories also involve the characters wendy darling and her two brothers peter fairy tinker bell the lost boys and the pirate captain hook
the play and novel were inspired by barrie friendship with the llewelyn davies family
barrie continued to revise the play for years after its debut until publication of the play script in
the play debuted in london on december with nina boucicault daughter of playwright dion boucicault in the title role
a broadway production was mounted in starring maude adams
it was later revived with such actresses as marilyn miller and eva le gallienne
the play has since been adapted as pantomime stage musical television special and several films including silent film walt disney animated full length feature film and live action production
the play is now rarely performed in its original form on stage in the united kingdom whereas pantomime adaptations are frequently staged around christmas
in the s the original version has also been supplanted in popularity by the musical version which became popular on television
the novel was first published in by hodder stoughton in the united kingdom and charles scribner sons in the united states
the original book contains frontispiece and half tone plates by artist d bedford whose illustrations are still under copyright in the eu
the novel was first abridged by may byron in with barrie permission and published under the title peter pan and wendy the first time this form was used
this version was later illustrated by mabel lucie attwell in
in barrie gave the copyright of the peter pan works to great ormond street hospital children hospital in london
barrie created peter pan in stories he told to the sons of his friend sylvia llewelyn davies with whom he had forged special relationship
mrs llewelyn davies death from cancer came within few years after the death of her husband
barrie was named as co guardian of the boys and unofficially adopted them
the character name comes from two sources peter llewelyn davies one of the boys and pan the mischievous greek god of the woodlands
andrew birkin has suggested that the inspiration for the character was barrie elder brother david whose death in skating accident at the age of fourteen deeply affected their mother
according to birkin the death was catastrophe beyond belief and one from which she never fully recovered
if margaret ogilvy barrie mother as the heroine of his novel of that title drew measure of comfort from the notion that david in dying boy would remain boy for ever barrie drew inspiration
the peter pan character first appeared in print in the novel the little white bird written for adults
the character was next used in the stage play peter pan or the boy who wouldn grow up that premiered in london on december and became an instant success
in the chapters of the little white bird which featured peter pan was published as the book peter pan in kensington gardens with illustrations by arthur rackham
barrie then adapted the play into the novel peter and wendy most often now published simply as peter pan
the original draft of the play was entitled simply anon play
barrie working titles for it included the great white father and peter pan or the boy who hated mothers
producer charles frohman disliked the title on the manuscript in answer to which barrie reportedly suggested the boy who couldn grow up frohman suggested changing it to wouldn and dropping the great white father as title
although the character appeared previously in barrie book the little white bird the play and its novelisation contain the story of peter pan mythos that is best known
the two versions differ in some details of the story but have much in common
in both versions peter makes night time calls on the darlings house in bloomsbury listening in on mrs mary darling bedtime stories by the open window
one night peter is spotted and while trying to escape he loses his shadow
on returning to claim it peter wakes mary daughter wendy darling
wendy succeeds in re attaching his shadow to him and peter learns that she knows lots of bedtime stories
he invites her to neverland to be mother to his gang the lost boys children who were lost in kensington gardens
wendy agrees and her brothers john and michael go along
their magical flight to neverland is followed by many adventures
the children are blown out of the air by cannon and wendy is nearly killed by the lost boy tootles
peter and the lost boys build little house for wendy to live in while she recuperates type of structure that to this day is called wendy house
soon john and michael adopt the ways of the lost boys
illustration by d bedford from the first edition
peter welcomes wendy to his underground home and she immediately assumes the role of mother figure
peter takes the darlings on several adventures the first truly dangerous one occurring at mermaids lagoon
at mermaids lagoon peter and the lost boys save the princess tiger lily and become involved in battle with the pirates including the evil captain hook
hook is hunted by crocodile which bit off his left hand and wants to eat the rest of him
he is named after the hook that replaced the hand
the crocodile swallowed ticking clock so hook is afraid of ticking sounds
peter is wounded when hook claws him
he believes he will die stranded on rock when the tide is rising but he views death as an awfully big adventure
luckily bird allows him to use her nest as boat and peter sails home
in gratitude for his saving tiger lily her tribe guard his home from the next imminent pirate attack
meanwhile wendy begins to fall in love with peter and asks him what kind of feelings he has for her
peter says that he is like her faithful son
one day while telling stories to the lost boys and her brothers john and michael wendy recalls her parents and then decides to take them back and return to england
unfortunately and unbeknownst to peter wendy and the boys are captured by captain hook who also tries to poison peter medicine while the boy is asleep
when peter awakes he learns from the fairy tinker bell that wendy has been kidnapped in an effort to please wendy he goes to drink his medicine
tink does not have time to warn him of the poison and instead drinks it herself causing her near death
tink tells him she could be saved if children believed in fairies
in one of the play most famous moments peter turns to the audience watching the play and begs those who believe in fairies to clap their hands
on the way he encounters the ticking crocodile peter decides to copy the tick so any animals will recognise it and leave him unharmed
he does not realise that he is still ticking as he boards the ship where hook cowers mistaking him for the crocodile
while the pirates are searching for the croc peter sneaks into the cabin to steal the keys and frees the lost boys
when the pirates investigate noise in the cabin peter defeats them
when he finally reveals himself he and hook begin the climactic battle which peter easily wins
he kicks hook into the jaws of the waiting crocodile and hook dies with the satisfaction that peter had literally kicked him off the ship which hook considers bad form
then peter takes control of the ship and sails the seas back to london
in the end wendy decides that her place is at home much to the joy of her heartsick mother
wendy then brings all the boys but peter back to london
before wendy and her brothers arrive at their house peter flies ahead to try and bar the window so wendy will think her mother has forgotten her
darling distress he bitterly leaves the window open and flies away
peter returns briefly and he meets mrs
darling who has agreed to adopt the lost boys
she offers to adopt peter as well but peter refuses afraid they will catch him and make him man
it is hinted that mary darling knew peter when she was girl because she is left slightly changed when peter leaves
peter promises to return for wendy every spring
the final scene of the play takes place year later when we see wendy preparing to go back home after the spring cleaning has taken place
peter has already forgotten about tinker bell the lost boys and even hook and does not understand wendy wistful wish that she could take him back with her
according to the narrator of the play it has something to do with the riddle of his being
if he could get the hang of the thing his cry might become to live would be an awfully big adventure
four years after the premiere of the original production of peter pan barrie wrote an additional scene entitled when wendy grew up
an afterthought later included in the final chapter of peter and wendy
in this scene peter returns for wendy years later
but she is now grown up with daughter of her own named jane
it is also revealed wendy married one of the lost boys although this is not mentioned in the novel and it is never revealed which one she did marry in the original draft of the play it is mentioned that she married tootles although barrie omitted this before publication
when peter learns that wendy has betrayed him by growing up he is heartbroken until jane agrees to come to neverland as peter new mother
in the novel last few sentences barrie mentions that jane has grown up as well and that peter now takes her daughter margaret to neverland
barrie says this cycle will go on forever as long as children are gay and innocent and heartless
an afterthought is only occasionally used in productions of the play but it made poignant conclusion to the musical production starring mary martin and provided the premise for disney sequel to their animated adaptation of the story return to never land
this epilogue was filmed for the film but not included in the final version though rough cut of the sequence was included as an extra on the dvd of the film
peter pan is one of the protagonists of the play and the novel
he is described in the novel as young boy who still has all his first teeth he wears clothes made of leaves autumn leaves in the play skeleton leaves in the novel and plays the pipes
he is the only boy able to fly without the help of tinker bell fairy dust
he has refused to grow up and distrusts mothers as he felt betrayed by his own mother
he cares about wendy but can only see her as motherly figure not as romantic and girlfriend love interest
barrie attributes this to the riddle of his very being
main article characters of peter pan
wendy darling by oliver herford the peter pan alphabet charles scribner sons new york
according to barrie description of the darlings house the family lives in bloomsbury london
wendy darling wendy is the eldest child their only daughter and the protagonist of the novel
she loves the idea of homemaking and storytelling and wants to become mother her dreams consist of adventures in little woodland house with her pet wolf
she bears bit of mutual animosity toward tiger lily because of their similar affections toward peter
she does not seem to feel the same way about tinker bell but the fairy is constantly bad mouthing her and even tries to have her killed
at the end of the novel she has grown up and is married with daughter jane and granddaughter margaret
she is portrayed variously with blonde brown or black hair in different stories
while it is not clear whether or not she is in love with peter one can assume that she does have some feelings toward him
wendy is often referred to as the mother of the lost boys and while peter also considers her to be his mother he takes on the father role hinting that they play married couple in their games
several writers have stated that barrie was the first to use the name wendy in published work and that the source of the name was barrie childhood friend margaret henley year old daughter of poet william ernest henley who pronounced the word friend as fwiendy adapted by barrie as wendy in writing the play
there is some evidence that the name wendy may be related to the welsh name gwendolyn and it is also used as diminutive variant of the eastern european name wanda but prior to its use in the peter pan stories the name was not used as an independent first name
john darling john is the middle child
he gets along well with wendy but he often argues with michael
he is fascinated with pirates and he once thought of becoming redhanded jack
he dreams of living in an inverted boat on the sands where he has no friends and spends his time shooting flamingos

darling george and mary darling are the children loving parents
darling is pompous blustering clerk in the city but kind at heart
mary darling is described as an intelligent romantic lady
it is hinted that she knew peter pan before her children were born
darling was named after the eldest llewelyn davies boy george and mrs
darling was named after mary ansell barrie wife although their personalities were based on arthur and sylvia llewelyn davies
in the stage version the roles of mr
darling and captain hook are traditionally played by the same actor
nana nana is newfoundland dog who is employed as nanny by the darling family
nana does not speak or do anything beyond the physical capabilities of large dog but acts with apparent understanding of her responsibilities
the character is played in stage productions by an actor in dog costume
barrie based the character of nana on his dog luath newfoundland

main article lost boys peter pan
tootles tootles is the humblest lost boy because he often misses out on their violent adventures
although he is often stupid he is always the first to defend wendy
ironically he shoots her before meeting her for the first time because of tinker bell trickery
in unreleased content for the play epilogue it is implied that wendy married tootles when they grew up
nibs nibs is described as gay and debonair probably the bravest lost boy
he says the only thing he remembers about his mother is she always wanted cheque book he says he would love to give her one if he knew what cheque book was
he also the oldest and best looking lost boy
slightly slightly is the most conceited because he believes he remembers the days before he was lost
he is the only lost boy who knows his last name he says his pinafore had the words slightly soiled written on the tag
he cuts whistles from the branches of trees and dances to tunes he creates himself
slightly is apparently poor make believer
he blows big breaths when he feels he is in trouble and he eventually leads to peter almost downfall
curly curly is the most troublesome lost boy
in disney version of the story he became cubby
the twins first and second twin know little about themselves they are not allowed to because peter pan does not know what twins are he thinks that twins are two parts of the same person which while not entirely correct is right in the sense that the twins finish each other sentences at least in the movie adaptation
main article characters of peter pan
tiger lily is the proud beautiful princess of the piccaninny tribe who are portrayed in way now regarded as stereotypical
barrie portrayed them as primitive warlike savages who spoke with guttural voice tones
she is apparently old enough to be married but refuses any suitors because she has feelings towards peter
she is jealous of wendy and tinker bell
tiger lily is nearly killed by captain hook when she is seen boarding the jolly roger with knife in her mouth but peter saves her
she is described as common fairy who mends pots and kettles and though she is sometimes ill behaved and vindictive at other times she is helpful and kind to peter for whom she has romantic feelings
the extremes in her personality are explained by the fact that fairy size prevents her from holding more than one feeling at time
in barrie book by peter first annual return for wendy the boy has forgotten about tinker bell and suggests that she is no more for fairies do not live long
captain james hook is the vengeful pirate who lives to kill peter pan not so much because peter cut off his right hand but because the boy is cocky and drives the genteel pirate to madness
he is captain of the ship jolly roger
he attended eton college before becoming pirate and is obsessed with good form
hook meets his demise when crocodile eats him
in the stage version the same actor who plays mr
darling also plays this character
mr smee is an irish nonconformist pirate
he is the boatswain of the jolly roger
smee is one of only two pirates to survive peter pan massacre
he then makes his living saying he was the only man james hook ever feared
gentleman starkey was once an usher at public school
starkey is one of two pirates who escaped peter pan massacre he swims ashore and becomes baby sitter to the piccaninny tribe
peter pan gives starkey hat to the never bird to use as nest
fairies in the novel peter and wendy published in there are fairies on neverland
in the part of the story where peter pan and the lost boys built house for wendy on neverland peter pan stays up late that night to guard her from the pirates but then the story says after time he fell asleep and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their way home from an orgy
any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night they would have mischiefed but they just tweaked peter nose and passed on
in the early th century the word orgy generally referred to large group of people consuming alcohol
mermaids who live in the waters near neverland reside within the mermaids lagoon
they are described as being very beautiful and mysterious creatures but equally just as vain and malevolent
barrie states in the novel peter and wendy that the mermaids are only friendly to peter and that they will intentionally splash or even attempt to drown anyone else if they come close enough
it is especially dangerous for mortals to go to mermaids lagoon at night because that when the mermaids sing hauntingly in the moonlight and utter strange wailing cries to attract potential victims
the crocodile is captain hook nemesis
during sword fight peter cut off hook right hand and fed it to crocodile which followed hook ever since hungering for more
the crocodile also swallowed clock which ticking warns hook of its presence
at the end of the story captain hook falls into the crocodile mouth and is swallowed whole
the play subtitle the boy who wouldn grow up underscores the primary theme the conflict between the innocence of childhood and the responsibility of adulthood
peter has literally chosen not to make the transition from one to the other and encourages the other children to do the same
however the opening line of the novel all children except one grow up and the conclusion of the story indicates that this wish is unrealistic and there is an element of tragedy in the alternative
barrie was very perspicacious in noticing many aspects of children mental development decades before they were studied by cognitive psychologists
in particular peter lacks the mental capacity for secondary mental representation and cannot recollect the past anticipate the future consider two things at once or see things from another person point of view
he is therefore amnesic inconsequential impulsive and callous
there is slight romantic aspect to the story which is sometimes played down or omitted completely
wendy flirtatious desire to kiss peter his desire for mother figure his conflicting feelings for wendy tiger lily and tinker bell each representing different female archetypes and the symbolism of his fight with captain hook traditionally played by the same actor as wendy father all could possibly hint at freudian interpretation see oedipus complex
most children adaptations of the play including the disney film omit any romantic themes between wendy and peter but barrie original his novelisation the mary martin musical and the and feature films all hint at the romantic elements
jeffrey howard has noted its existential motifs claiming that peter pan is precautionary tale for those who fear the responsibilities of living and the uncertainties of dying which explores concepts like the inevitability of death freedom to create our lives alienation and the notion that existence lacks any obvious or inherent meaning
the original stage production took place at the duke of york theatre london on december
it starred gerald du maurier as captain hook and mr darling and nina boucicault as peter
members of peter band were joan burnett tootles christine silver nibs w baskcomb slightly alice dubarry curly pauline chase st twin phyllis beadon nd twin

tinker bell was represented on stage by darting light created by small mirror held in the hand off stage and reflecting little circle of light from powerful lamp and her voice was collar of bells and two special ones that barrie brought from switzerland
however miss jane wren or jenny wren was listed among the cast on the programmes of the original productions as playing tinker bell this was meant as joke that fooled m
inspector of taxes who sent her tax demand
it is traditional in productions of peter pan for mr
darling the children father and captain hook to be played or voiced by the same actor
although this was originally done simply to make full use of the actor the characters appear in different sections of the story with no thematic intent some critics have perceived similarity between the two characters as central figures in the lives of the children
it also brings poignant juxtaposition between mr
darling harmless bluster and captain hook pompous vanity
cecilia loftus played peter in the production
pauline chase took the role from the london season until while zena dare was peter on tour during most of that period
jean forbes robertson became well known pan in london in the and

there have been several additions to peter pan story including the authorised sequel novel peter pan in scarlet and the high profile sequel films return to never land and hook
various characters from the story have appeared in other places especially tinker bell as mascot and character of disney
the characters are in the public domain in some jurisdictions leading to unauthorised extensions to the mythos and uses of the characters
some of these have been controversial such as series of prequels by dave barry and ridley pearson and lost girls sexually explicit graphic novel by alan moore and melinda gebbie featuring wendy darling and the heroines of the wonderful wizard of oz and alice adventures in wonderland
there has been controversy surrounding some aspects of the novel and its subsequent adaptations
critics have argued that the novel has racist undertones specifically in the case of the redskins tribe to which tiger lily belongs who refer to peter as the great white father
later screen adaptations have taken various approaches to these characters sometimes presenting them as racial caricatures omitting them attempting to present them more authentically or reframing them as another kind of exotic people
the copyright status of the story of peter pan and its characters has been the subject of dispute particularly as the original version began to enter the public domain in various jurisdictions
in barrie gave the copyright to the works featuring peter pan to great ormond street hospital gosh britain leading children hospital and requested that the value of the gift should never be disclosed this gift was confirmed in his will
gosh has exercised these rights internationally to help support the work of the institution
the uk copyright originally expired at the end of years after barrie death but later revived in when legislation was changed following the directive to harmonise copyright laws within the eu which extended the copyright term to years after the author death
however in former prime minister james callaghan sponsored an amendment to parliamentary bill granting the hospital right to royalties in perpetuity for any performance publication broadcast of the play or adaptation of the play
the bill does not grant the hospital full intellectual property rights over the work such as creative control over the use of the material or the right to refuse permission to use it
it does not cover the peter pan section of the little white bird which predates the play and is not therefore an adaptation of it
the exact phrasing is in section of and schedule to the copyright designs and patents act
the provisions of schedule have effect for conferring on trustees for the benefit of the hospital for sick children great ormond street london right to royalty in respect of the public performance commercial publication broadcasting or inclusion in cable programme service of the play peter pan by sir james matthew barrie or of any adaptation of that work notwithstanding that copyright in the work expired on december
great ormond street hospital gosh claims that s legislation effective in and again in which extended the copyright of the play script published in gives them copyright over peter pan in general until although gosh acknowledges that the copyright of the novel version published in has expired in the united states
previously gosh claim of s copyright had been contested by various parties
j somma sued gosh to permit the s publication of her sequel after the rain new adventure for peter pan
gosh and somma settled out of court in march issuing joint statement in which gosh stated the work is valuable contribution to the field of children literature
somma characterised her novel which she had argued was critique of the original work rather than mere derivative of it as fair use of the hospital u intellectual property rights
the suit was settled under terms of absolute secrecy
it did not set any legal precedent however
disney was long time licensee to the animation rights and cooperated with the hospital when its copyright claim was clear but in disney published dave barry and ridley pearson peter and the starcatchers in the s the first of several sequels without permission and without making royalty payments
in top shelf productions published in the s lost girls pornographic graphic novel featuring wendy darling also without permission or royalties
