They were supposed to be rich , as their effects in two panniers were brought into the serai , and carefully watched by them . By some unlucky chance , just as the evening set in , they were visited by two or three other merchants whom they seemed to know , and who persuaded them to wait for another week , and to join them in their journey up the country . To the extreme mortification of Surfuraz Khan they agreed to the proposal ; but as they said there would be danger in removing their bags from the serai at night , they told their friends they would sleep there , and join them in the morning . Surfuraz Khan , I hear , made every exertion by persuasion to induce them to alter their determination , but in vain . So you know there remained but one alternative , which was to put them to death in the serai , and to dispose of the bodies as well as they could ; besides , the circumstance of the men being afraid to risk their bags by removal at night , looked as though they were of value . I must own , Meer Sahib , it was tempting ; it would even have been so for you or me , -- how much more for the Khan ! Had he even waited till towards morning , done the business , and started , leaving the bodies where they were , he could have got clean off with the booty , which was large , and he could have come round the back of the city and joined you or me ; any one of us could have taken his post in the Karwan , and no one would have been at all suspicious .
