dr_mortimer now fears for sir charles nephew and sole heir sir henry who is the new master of henry hall
the death was attributed to heart attack but dr_mortimer is suspicious because sir charles died with an expression of horror on his face and dr_mortimer noticed the footprints of gigantic hound about yards from where sir charles lay dead
the henry family has supposedly been under curse since the era of the english civil war when ancestor hugo henry allegedly offered his soul to the devil for help in abducting woman and was reportedly killed by giant spectral hound
sir charles believed in the curse and was apparently fleeing from something in fright when he died

holmes now even more interested in the henry affair but held up with other cases dispatches watson to accompany sir henry to henry hall with instructions to send him frequent reports about the merripit_house grounds and neighbours
upon arrival at the grand but austere henry estate watson and sir henry learn that an escaped murderer named selden is believed to be in the area
barrymore and his wife who also works at henry hall wish to leave the estate soon
watson hears woman crying in the night it is obvious to him that it was barrymore but her husband denies it
watson can find no proof that barrymore was in devon on the day of the chase in london
he meets brother and sister who live nearby stapleton naturalist and the beautiful miss_stapleton
when an animal sound is heard stapleton is quick to dismiss it as unrelated to the legendary hound
when her brother is out of earshot miss_stapleton mistakes watson for sir henry and warns him to leave
she and sir henry later meet and quickly fall in love arousing stapleton anger he later apologises and invites sir henry to dine with him few days later
barrymore arouses further suspicion when watson and sir henry catch him at night with candle in an empty room
barrymore refuses to answer their questions but barrymore confesses that selden is her brother and her husband is signalling that they have left supplies for him

after an agreement is reached to allow selden to flee the country barrymore reveals the contents of an incompletely burnt letter asking sir charles to be at the gate at the time of his death
it was signed with the initials l
on dr_mortimer advice watson questions laura mrs_laura_lyons who admits to writing the letter in hopes that sir charles would help finance her divorce but says she did not keep the appointment
watson tracks the second man he saw in the area and discovers it to be holmes investigating independently in hopes of faster resolution
holmes reveals further information stapleton is actually married to the supposed miss_stapleton and he promised marriage to laura mrs_laura_lyons to get her cooperation
they hear scream and discover the body of selden dead from fall
they initially mistake him for sir henry whose old clothes he was wearing
at henry hall holmes notices resemblance between stapleton and portrait of hugo henry
he realises that stapleton could be an unknown henry family member seeking to claim the henry wealth by eliminating his relatives
reasuring sir henry to keep dinner date with the stapletons holmes and watson pretend to travel to london but in fact they interview laura mrs_laura_lyons who is angered when she learns the truth of the stapletons she confirms that it was stapleton who thrice tricked her first into writing the fatal letter to sir charles and then not keeping the appoiment and lastly not revealing it was stapleton idea
accompanied by inspector lestrade whom holmes has summoned holmes and watson travel to the stapleton home where sir henry is dining
they rescue him from hound that stapleton releases while sir henry is walking home across the moor
shooting the animal dead in the struggle sherlock reveals that it was perfectly mortal dog mix of bloodhound and mastiff painted with phosphorus to give it hellish appearance
they find miss_stapleton bound and gagged inside the merripit_house while stapleton apparently dies in an attempt to reach his hideout in nearby mine located at the heart of the grimpen mire
they also find sir henry boot which was used to give the hound sir henry scent
weeks later holmes provides watson with additional details about the case
from the unsigned note holmes noticed woman perfume
from the appearance and disappearance of henrys boots holmes deduces that the hound is not ghost but real
jack stapleton was in fact rodger henry son also named rodger and was physical and moral throwback to hugo henry
his now widow is south american woman the former beryl garcia
he supported himself through crime for many years first by fleeing central america after his marriage when he stole considerable amount of public money in at yorkshire he used the money to open public school however the tutor he had hired to make the school success died of consumption henry then tried to use the school to teach his pupils crime which was struck by an epidemic which killed three students he was compelled to close the school in
he took the remains of his fortune his wife and his taste for entomology in which he was an expert to his ancestorial home in devonshire although holmes cannot prove it he believes that henry supported himself by engaging in several bulgaries and one murder before learning that he could inherit fortune by murdering his uncle and cousin
stapleton had taken sir henry old boot because the new unworn boot lacked his scent
the hound had pursued selden to his death because of the scent on sir henry old clothes
mrs stapleton had disavowed her husband plot so he had imprisoned her to prevent her from interfering
holmes pays stapleton backhanded compliment as man who for years has been one of the most dangerous and desperate persons holmes has ever come across
the story ends with holmes and watson leaving to see the opera les huguenots starring jean de reszke
henry hall formally clyro court
it is thought this merripit_house may have provided conan doyle with the inspiration for the hound of the henrys
the ruins of fowelscombe merripit_house viewed in possible model for henry hall
sir arthur conan doyle wrote this story shortly after returning to his home undershaw from south africa where he had worked as volunteer physician at the langman field hospital in bloemfontein at the time of the second boer war
conan doyle had not written about holmes in eight years having killed off the character in the story the final problem
although the hound of the henrys is set before the latter events two years later conan doyle would bring holmes back for good explaining in the adventure of the empty merripit_house that holmes had faked his own death
he was assisted with the plot by year old daily express journalist named bertram fletcher robinson
his ideas came from the legend of richard cabell of brook hall in the parish of buckfastleigh devon which was the fundamental inspiration for the henry tale of hellish hound and cursed country squire
cabell tomb survives in the village of buckfastleigh
squire richard cabell lived for hunting and was what in those days was described as monstrously evil man
he gained this reputation for amongst other things immorality and having sold his soul to the devil
there was also rumour that he had murdered his wife elizabeth fowell daughter of sir edmund fowell st baronet of fowelscombe
on july he died and was laid to rest in the sepulchre
the night of his interment saw phantom pack of hounds come baying across the moor to howl at his tomb
from that night on he could be found leading the phantom pack across the moor usually on the anniversary of his death
if the pack were not out hunting they could be found ranging around his grave howling and shrieking
in an attempt to lay the soul to rest the villagers built large building around the tomb and to be doubly sure huge slab was placed
moreover devon folklore includes tales of fearsome supernatural dog known as the yeth hound that conan doyle may have heard
it is believed by weller that henry hall is based on one of three possible merripit_houses on or near dartmoor namely fowelscombe in the parish of ugborough the seat of the fowell baronets hayford hall near buckfastleigh also owned by john king of fowelscombe and brook hall in the parish of buckfastleigh about two miles east of hayford the actual home of richard cabell husband of elizabeth fowell
it has also been claimed that henry hall is based on property in mid wales built in by one thomas mynors henry
the merripit_house was formerly named clyro court and was renamed henry hall towards the end of the last century
arthur conan doyle was apparently family friend who often stayed there and may have been aware of local legend of the hound of the henrys
still other tales claim that conan doyle was inspired by his time on holiday in north norfolk where the tale of black shuck is well known
the pre gothic cromer hall where conan doyle stayed also closely resembles doyle vivid descriptions of henry hall
dr_mortimer lynam molloy friend of doyle and author of love old sweet song married florence henry daughter of henry of crowsley park oxfordshire
the gates to the park had statues of hell hounds spears through their mouths
above the lintel there was another statue of hell hound
in doyle original manuscript of the book was broken up into individual leaves as part of promotional campaign by doyle american publisher they were used as part of window displays by individual booksellers
other leaves are owned by university libraries and private collectors
newly rediscovered example was sold at auction in for us
