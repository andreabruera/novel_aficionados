at the ball mr bingley is open and cheerful popular with all the guests and appears to be very attracted to the beautiful miss jane bennet with whom he dances twice
his friend mr darcy is reputed to be twice as wealthy he is haughty and aloof and his manners cause everyone to turn from interest to decided dislike of him
he declines to dance with elizabeth stating that she is not pretty enough to tempt him

mr collins cousin of mr bennet and heir to the longbourn estate visits the bennet family
he is pompous and obsequious clergyman who intends to marry one of the bennet girls
when he learns about jane and mr bingley he quickly decides to propose to elizabeth as the next in both age and beauty
elizabeth and her family meet the dashing and charming george wickham who singles out elizabeth and tells her story of the hardship that mr darcy has caused him by depriving him of living position as clergyman in prosperous parish with good revenue that once granted is for life promised to him by mr darcy late father
elizabeth dislike of mr darcy is confirmed
at ball at netherfield elizabeth reluctantly dances with mr darcy
other than jane and elizabeth several members of the bennet family show distinct lack of decorum
mrs bennet hints loudly that she fully expects jane and bingley to become engaged and the younger bennet sisters expose the family to ridicule
mr collins proposes to elizabeth who rejects him to the fury of her mother and the relief of her father
shortly after they receive news that the bingleys are suddenly leaving for london with no intention to return
after his humiliating rejection by elizabeth mr collins proposes to charlotte lucas sensible young woman and elizabeth friend
charlotte is slightly older and is grateful to receive proposal that will guarantee her comfortable home
elizabeth is aghast at such pragmatism in matters of love
heartbroken jane goes to visit her aunt and uncle gardiner at an unfashionable address in london
there it becomes clear that miss bingley does not want to resume their friendship and jane is upset though very composed
in the spring elizabeth visits charlotte and mr collins in kent
elizabeth and her hosts are invited to rosings park the imposing home of lady catherine de bourgh patroness of mr collins and mr darcy extremely wealthy aunt
she expects mr darcy to marry her daughter
mr darcy and his cousin colonel fitzwilliam are also visiting at rosings park
colonel fitzwilliam tells elizabeth how mr darcy managed to save friend from bad match
elizabeth realises the story must refer to jane and is horrified that darcy has interfered and caused her sister so much pain
mr darcy has fallen in love with elizabeth and proposes to her
she rejects him angrily stating that she could not love man who has caused her sister such unhappiness and further accuses him of treating mr wickham unjustly
the latter accusation angers mr darcy and he accuses her family of lacking propriety and suggests he has been kinder to bingley than to himself
later mr darcy gives elizabeth letter explaining that mr wickham had refused the living he claimed he was deprived of and was given money for it instead
wickham proceeded to waste the money and when impoverished asked for the living again
after being refused he tried to elope with darcy year old sister georgiana for her large dowry
darcy also writes that he believed jane because of her reserved behaviour did not love mr bingley
darcy apologises for hurting jane and elizabeth begins to change her opinion of mr darcy
elizabeth tells her father that darcy was responsible for uniting lydia and wickham one of the two earliest illustrations of pride and prejudice
the clothing styles reflect the time the illustration was engraved the not the time in which the novel was written or set
some months later elizabeth and her aunt and uncle gardiner visit darcy estate in derbyshire pemberley after elizabeth ascertains that the owner will not be there
on tour elizabeth hears the housekeeper describe him as being kind and generous
when mr darcy returns unexpectedly he is exceedingly gracious and later invites elizabeth and the gardiners to meet his sister and mr gardiner to go fishing
elizabeth is surprised and delighted by their treatment
she then suddenly receives news that her sister lydia had eloped with mr wickham
she tells mr darcy immediately and departs in haste believing she will never see him again since lydia disgrace has ruined the family good name
after an agonising wait mr wickham is somehow persuaded to marry lydia
with some veneer of decency restored lydia visits her family and tells elizabeth that mr darcy was at her wedding
mrs gardiner informs elizabeth that it is mr darcy who made the match at great expense and trouble to himself and hints that he may have another motive for doing so
mr bingley and mr darcy return to netherfield and soon bingley proposes to jane and is accepted
lady catherine having heard rumours that elizabeth intends to marry darcy visits elizabeth and demands that she promise not to accept his proposal
elizabeth refuses to do so and the outraged lady catherine leaves
darcy heartened by elizabeth response again proposes to her and is accepted
elizabeth has difficulty in convincing her father that she is marrying for love not position and wealth but in the end mr bennet is convinced

earl of matlock colonel fitzwilliam
elizabeth and mr darcy by hugh thomson
elizabeth bennet the second of the bennet daughters she is twenty years old and intelligent lively playful attractive and witty but with tendency to judge on first impressions
as the story progresses so does her relationship with mr darcy
the course of elizabeth and darcy relationship is ultimately decided when darcy overcomes his pride and elizabeth overcomes her prejudice leading them both to surrender to their love for each other
mr fitzwilliam darcy mr bingley friend and the wealthy twenty eight year old owner of the family estate of pemberley in derbyshire rumoured to be worth at least year or in today money
while being handsome tall and intelligent darcy lacks ease and social graces and so others frequently mistake his aloof decorum and rectitude as further proof of excessive pride which in part it is
a newcomer to the village he is ultimately elizabeth bennet love interest
mr bennet late middle aged landed gentleman of modest income of per annum and the dryly sarcastic patriarch of the now dwindling bennet family family of hertfordshire landed gentry with five unmarried daughters
his estate longbourn is entailed to the male line
mrs bennet née gardiner the middle aged wife of her social superior mr bennet and the mother of their five daughters
mrs bennet is hypochondriac who imagines herself susceptible to attacks of tremors and palpitations her poor nerves whenever things are not going her way
her main ambition in life is to marry her daughters off to wealthy men
whether or not any such matches will give her daughters happiness is of little concern to her
in letter to cassandra dated may jane austen describes picture she saw at gallery which was good likeness of mrs bingley jane bennet
deirdre le faye in the world of her novels suggests that portrait of mrs is the picture austen was referring to
jane bennet the eldest bennet sister
twenty two years old when the novel begins she is considered the most beautiful young lady in the neighbourhood and is inclined to see only the good in others
she falls in love with charles bingley rich young gentleman recently moved to hertfordshire and close friend of mr darcy
mary bennet the middle bennet sister and the plainest of her siblings
mary has serious disposition and mostly reads and plays music although she is often impatient to display her accomplishments and is rather vain about them
she frequently moralises to her family
according to james edward austen leigh a memoir of jane austen mary ended up marrying one of her uncle philips law clerks and moving into meryton with him
catherine kitty bennet the fourth bennet daughter at years old
though older than lydia she is her shadow and follows her in her pursuit of the officers of the militia
she is often portrayed as envious of lydia and is described silly young woman
however it is said that she improved when removed from lydia influence
according to james edward austen leigh a memoir of jane austen kitty later married clergyman who lived near pemberley
lydia bennet the youngest bennet sister aged when the novel begins
she is frivolous and headstrong
her main activity in life is socializing especially flirting with the officers of the militia
this leads to her running off with george wickham although he has no intention of marrying her
lydia shows no regard for the moral code of her society as ashley tauchert says she feels without reasoning
charles bingley handsome amiable wealthy young gentleman from the north of england possibly yorkshire as scarborough is mentioned and there is in fact real life town called bingley in west yorkshire who leases netherfield park an estate three miles from longbourn with the hopes of purchasing it
he is contrasted with mr darcy for having more generally pleasing manners although he is reliant on his more experienced friend for advice
an example of this is the prevention of bingley and jane romance because of bingley undeniable dependence on darcy opinion
he lacks resolve and is easily influenced by others his two sisters miss caroline bingley and mrs louisa hurst both disapprove of bingley growing affection for miss jane bennet
caroline bingley the vainglorious snobbish sister of charles bingley with dowry of
miss bingley harbours designs upon mr darcy and therefore is jealous of his growing attachment to elizabeth
she attempts to dissuade mr darcy from liking elizabeth by ridiculing the bennet family and criticising elizabeth comportment
miss bingley also disapproves of her brother esteem for jane bennet and is disdainful of society in meryton
her wealth her dowry gives her an income of per annum which she overspends and her expensive education seem to be the two greatest sources of miss bingley vanity and conceit likewise she is very insecure about the fact that her and her family money all comes from trade and is eager both for her brother to purchase an estate ascending the bingleys to the ranks of the gentry and for herself to marry landed gentleman e
the dynamic between miss bingley and her sister louisa hurst seems to echo that of lydia and kitty bennet that one is no more than follower of the other with caroline in the same position as lydia and louisa in kitty though in louisa case as she already married she not under the same desperation as caroline
louisa is married to mr hurst who has house in grosvenor square london
george wickham wickham has been acquainted with mr darcy since infancy being the son of mr darcy father steward
an officer in the militia he is superficially charming and rapidly forms an attachment with elizabeth bennet
he later runs off with lydia with no intention of marriage which would have resulted in her and her family complete disgrace but for darcy intervention to bribe wickham to marry her by paying off his immediate debts
mr william collins mr collins aged years old as the novel begins is mr bennet distant second cousin clergyman and the current heir presumptive to his estate of longbourn house
he is an obsequious and pompous man who is excessively devoted to his patroness lady catherine de bourgh
lady catherine de bourgh the overbearing aunt of mr darcy
lady catherine is the wealthy owner of rosings park where she resides with her daughter anne and is fawned upon by her rector mr collins
she is haughty pompous domineering and condescending and has long planned to marry off her sickly daughter to darcy to unite their two great estates claiming it to be the dearest wish of both her and her late sister lady anne darcy née fitzwilliam
mr edward and mrs gardiner edward gardiner is mrs bennet brother and successful tradesman of sensible and gentlemanly character
aunt gardiner is genteel and elegant and is close to her nieces jane and elizabeth
the gardiners are instrumental in bringing about the marriage between darcy and elizabeth
georgiana darcy georgiana is mr darcy quiet amiable and shy younger sister with dowry of and is aged barely when the story begins
when still miss darcy almost eloped with mr wickham but was saved by her brother whom she idolises
thanks to years of tutorage under masters she is accomplished at the piano singing playing the harp and drawing and modern languages and is therefore described as caroline bingley idea of an accomplished woman
charlotte lucas charlotte is elizabeth friend who at years old and thus very much beyond what was then considered prime marriageable age fears becoming burden to her family and therefore agrees to marry mr collins to gain financial security
though the novel stresses the importance of love and understanding in marriage austen never seems to condemn charlotte decision to marry for money
she uses charlotte to convey how women of her time would adhere to society expectation for women to marry even if it is not out of love but convenience
charlotte is the daughter of sir william lucas and lady lucas neighbours of the bennet family
colonel fitzwilliam colonel fitzwilliam is the younger son of an earl and the nephew of lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy this makes him the cousin of anne de bourgh and the darcy siblings fitzwilliam and georgiana
he is about years old at the beginning of the novel
he is the co guardian of miss georgiana darcy along with his cousin mr darcy
comprehensive web showing the relationships between the main characters in pride and prejudice
many critics take the title as the start when analysing the themes of pride and prejudice but robert fox cautions against reading too much into the title because commercial factors may have played role in its selection
after the success of sense and sensibility nothing would have seemed more natural than to bring out another novel of the same author using again the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title
it should be pointed out that the qualities of the title are not exclusively assigned to one or the other of the protagonists both elizabeth and darcy display pride and prejudice
the phrase pride and prejudice had been used over the preceding two centuries by joseph hall jeremy taylor joseph addison and samuel johnson
austen probably took her title from passage in fanny burney cecilia popular novel she is known to have admired
if to pride and prejudice you owe your miseries so wonderfully is good and evil balanced that to pride and prejudice you will also owe their termination
capitalisation as in the original
a theme in much of austen work is the importance of environment and upbringing in developing young people character and morality
social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her world and further theme common to austen work is ineffectual parents
in pride and prejudice the failure of mr and mrs bennet as parents is blamed for lydia lack of moral judgment
darcy has been taught to be principled and scrupulously honourable but he is also proud and overbearing
kitty rescued from lydia bad influence and spending more time with her older sisters after they marry is said to improve greatly in their superior society
the american novelist anna quindlen observed in an introduction to an edition of austen novel in
pride and prejudice is also about that thing that all great novels consider the search for self
and it is the first great novel that teaches us this search is as surely undertaken in the drawing room making small talk as in the pursuit of great white whale or the public punishment of adultery
the opening line of the novel famously announces it is truth universally acknowledged that single man in possession of good fortune must be in want of wife
this sets marriage as motif and problem in the novel
readers are poised to question whether or not these single men need wife or if the need is dictated by the neighbourhood families and their daughters who require good fortune
marriage is complex social activity that takes political economy and economy generally into account
in the case of charlotte lucas the seeming success of her marriage lies in the comfortable financial circumstances of their household while the relationship between mr and mrs bennet serves to illustrate bad marriages based on an initial attraction and surface over substance economic and psychological
the bennets marriage is an example that the youngest bennet lydia re enacts with wickham and the results are far from felicitous
although the central characters elizabeth and darcy begin the novel as hostile acquaintances and unlikely friends they eventually work toward better understanding of themselves and each other which frees them to truly fall in love
this does not eliminate the challenges of the real differences in their technically equivalent social status as gentlemen and their female relations
it does however provide them with an better understanding of each other point of view from the different ends of the rather wide scale of differences within that category
when elizabeth rejects darcy first proposal the argument of marrying for love is introduced
elizabeth only accepts darcy proposal when she is certain she loves him and her feelings are reciprocated
austen complex sketching of different marriages ultimately allows readers to question what forms of alliance are desirable especially when it comes to privileging economic sexual companionate attraction
money plays fundamental role in the marriage market for the young ladies seeking well off husband and for men who wish to marry woman of means
george wickham tried to elope with georgiana darcy and colonel fitzwilliam married for money
marrying woman of rich family also ensured linkage to high family as is visible in the desires of bingley sisters to have their brother married to georgiana darcy
mrs bennet is frequently seen encouraging her daughters to marry wealthy man of high social class
in chapter when mr bingley arrives she declares am thinking of his marrying one of them
inheritance was by descent but could be further restricted by entailment which would restrict inheritance to male heirs only
in the case of the bennet family mr collins was to inherit the family estate upon mr bennet death and his proposal to elizabeth would have ensured her security but she refuses his offer
inheritance laws benefited males because most women did not have independent legal rights until the second half of the th century and women financial security depended on men
for the upper middle and aristocratic classes marriage to man with reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and the children she was to have
the irony of the opening line is that generally within this society it would be woman who would be looking for wealthy husband to have prosperous life
lady catherine and elizabeth by e brock
lady catherine confronts elizabeth about darcy on the title page of the first illustrated edition
this is the other of the first two illustrations of the novel
austen might be known now for her romances but the marriages in her novels engage with economics and class distinction
pride and prejudice is hardly the exception
when darcy proposes to elizabeth he cites their economic and social differences as an obstacle his excessive love has had to overcome though he still anxiously harps on the problems it poses for him within his social circle
his aunt lady catherine later characterises these differences in particularly harsh terms when she conveys what elizabeth marriage to darcy will become will the shades of pemberley be thus polluted
although elizabeth responds to lady catherine accusations that hers is potentially contaminating economic and social position elizabeth even insists she and darcy as gentleman daughter and gentleman are equals lady catherine refuses to accept darcy actual marriage to elizabeth even as the novel closes
the bingleys present particular problem for navigating class
though caroline bingley and mrs hurst behave and speak of others as if they have always belonged in the upper echelons of society austen makes point to explain that the bingleys are trade rather than inheritors and rentiers
the fact that bingley rents netherfield hall it is after all to let distinguishes him significantly from darcy whose estate belonged to his father family and through his mother is the grandson and nephew of an earl
bingley unlike darcy does not own his property but has portable and growing wealth that makes him good catch on the marriage market for poorer daughters of the gentry like jane bennet ambitious cits merchant class etc
class plays central role in the evolution of the characters and jane austen radical approach to class is seen as the plot unfolds
there is an undercurrent of the old anglo norman upper class hinted at in the story as suggested by the names of fitzwilliam darcy and his aunt lady catherine de bourgh fitzwilliam arcy de bourgh burke and even bennet are traditional norman surnames
through their interactions and their critiques of each other darcy and elizabeth come to recognise their faults and work to correct them
elizabeth meditates on her own mistakes thoroughly in chapter
she cried who have prided myself on my discernment
i who have valued myself on my abilities
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust
how humiliating is this discovery
had been in love could not have been more wretchedly blind
but vanity not love has been my folly
pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned
till this moment never knew myself
other characters rarely exhibit this depth of understanding or at least are not given the space within the novel for this sort of development
tanner writes that mrs bennet in particular has very limited view of the requirements of that performance lacking any introspective tendencies she is incapable of appreciating the feelings of others and is only aware of material objects
mrs bennet behaviour reflects the society in which she lives as she knows that her daughters will not succeed if they don get married
the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news
this shows that mrs bennet is only aware of material objects and not of her feelings and emotions
pride and prejudice like most of austen works employs the narrative technique of free indirect speech which has been defined as the free representation of character speech by which one means not words actually spoken by character but the words that typify the character thoughts or the way the character would think or speak if she thought or spoke
austen creates her characters with fully developed personalities and unique voices
though darcy and elizabeth are very alike they are also considerably different
by using narrative that adopts the tone and vocabulary of particular character in this case elizabeth austen invites the reader to follow events from elizabeth viewpoint sharing her prejudices and misapprehensions
the learning curve while undergone by both protagonists is disclosed to us solely through elizabeth point of view and her free indirect speech is essential for it is through it that we remain caught if not stuck within elizabeth misprisions
the few times the reader is allowed to gain further knowledge of another character feelings is through the letters exchanged in this novel
darcy first letter to elizabeth is an example of this as through his letter the reader and elizabeth are both given knowledge of wickham true character
austen is known to use irony throughout the novel especially from viewpoint of the character of elizabeth bennet
she conveys the oppressive rules of femininity that actually dominate her life and work and are covered by her beautifully carved trojan horse of ironic distance
beginning with historical investigation of the development of particular literary form and then transitioning into empirical verifications it reveals free indirect discourse as tool that emerged over time as practical means for addressing the physical distinctness of minds
seen in this way free indirect discourse is distinctly literary response to an environmental concern providing scientific justification that does not reduce literature to mechanical extension of biology but takes its value to be its own original form
page of letter from jane austen to her sister cassandra june in which she first mentions pride and prejudice using its working title first impressions
austen began writing the novel after staying at goodnestone park in kent with her brother edward and his wife in
it was originally titled first impressions and was written between october and august
on november austen father sent letter to london bookseller thomas cadell to ask if he had any interest in seeing the manuscript but the offer was declined by return post
the militia were mobilised after the french declaration of war on britain in february and there was initially lack of barracks for all the militia regiments requiring the militia to set up huge camps in the countryside which the novel refers to several times
the brighton camp for which the militia regiment leaves in may after spending the winter in meryton was opened in august and the barracks for all the regiments of the militia were completed by placing the events of the novel between and
austen made significant revisions to the manuscript for first impressions between and
as nothing remains of the original manuscript we are reduced to conjecture
from the large number of letters in the final novel it is assumed that first impressions was an epistolary novel
she later renamed the story pride and prejudice around about which she sold the rights to publish the manuscript to thomas egerton for equivalent to in
in renaming the novel austen probably had in mind the sufferings and oppositions summarised in the final chapter of fanny burney cecilia called pride and prejudice where the phrase appears three times in block capitals
it is possible that the novel original title was altered to avoid confusion with other works
in the years between the completion of first impressions and its revision into pride and prejudice two other works had been published under that name novel by margaret holford and comedy by horace smith
title page of edition illustrated by e brock
austen sold the copyright for the novel to thomas egerton from the military library whitehall in exchange for austen had asked for
austen had published sense and sensibility on commission basis whereby she indemnified the publisher against any losses and received any profits less costs and the publisher commission
unaware that sense and sensibility would sell out its edition making her she passed the copyright to egerton for one off payment meaning that all the risk and all the profits would be his
jan fergus has calculated that egerton subsequently made around from just the first two editions of the book
egerton published the first edition of pride and prejudice in three hardcover volumes on january
it was advertised in the morning chronicle priced at
favourable reviews saw this edition sold out with second edition published in november that year
a third edition was published in
foreign language translations first appeared in in french subsequent translations were published in german danish and swedish
pride and prejudice was first published in the united states in august as elizabeth bennet or pride and prejudice
the novel was also included in richard bentley standard novel series in
r chapman scholarly edition of pride and prejudice first published in has become the standard edition on which many modern published versions of the novel are based
the novel was originally published without austen name
it was instead written by the author of sense and sensibility
this carried responsibility for austen unlike when sense and sensibility was released as being written by lady
main article reception history of jane austen
the novel was well received with three favourable reviews in the first months following publication
anne isabella milbanke later to be the wife of lord byron called it the fashionable novel
noted critic and reviewer george henry lewes declared that he would rather have written pride and prejudice or tom jones than any of the waverley novels
charlotte brontë however in letter to lewes wrote that pride and prejudice was disappointment carefully fenced highly cultivated garden with neat borders and delicate flowers but no open country no fresh air no blue hill no bonny beck
austen for her part thought the playfulness and epigrammaticism of pride and prejudice was excessive complaining in letter to her sister cassandra in that the novel lacked shade and should have had chapter of solemn specious nonsense about something unconnected with the story an essay on writing critique on walter scott or the history of bounaparté
you could not shock her more than she shocks me
beside her joyce seems innocent as grass
it makes me most uncomfortable to see
an english spinster of the middle class
describe the amorous effects of brass
reveal so frankly and with such sobriety
the american scholar claudia johnson defended the novel from the criticism that it has an unrealistic fairy tale quality
one critic mary poovey wrote the romantic conclusion of pride and prejudice is an attempt to hedge the conflict between the individualistic perspective inherent in the bourgeois value system and the authoritarian hierarchy retained from traditional paternalistic society
johnson wrote that austen view of power structure capable of reformation was not an escape from conflict
johnson wrote the outrageous unconventionality of elizabeth bennet was in austen own time very daring especially given the strict censorship that was imposed in britain by the prime minister william pitt in the when austen wrote pride and prejudice
