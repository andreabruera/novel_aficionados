<p/>Norwood Press J. S. Cushing Co.--Berwick & Smith Co.. Norwood, Mass., U.S.A.      TO MY BROTHER HERBERT MACDONALD PHILLPOTTS A SMALL TRIBUTE OF GREAT AFFECTION     THE THREE BROTHERS    BOOK I    CHAPTER I  From Great Trowlesworthy's crown of rosy granite the world extended to the moor-edge, and thence, by mighty, dim, air-drenched passages of earth and sky, to the horizons of the sea.
<p/>A clear May noon illuminated the waste, and Dartmoor, soaking her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) fill of sunshine, ran over with it, so that Devon's self spread little darker of bosom than the grey and silver of high clouds lifted above her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>), mountainous under the sun.
<p/>Hills and plains were still mottled with the winter coat of the heather, and the verdure of the spearing grasses suffered diminution under a far-flung pallor of dead blades above breaking green; but the face of Dartmoor began to glow and the spring gorse leapt like a running flame along it.
<p/>At water's brink was starry silver of crow-foot, and the heath, still darkling, sheltered sky-blue milk-wort and violet and the budding gold of the tormentil.
<p/>One white road ran due north-east and south-west across the desert, and round about it, like the tents of the Anakim, rose huge snowy hillocks and ridges silver-bright in the sun.
<p/>Here the venerable Arch√¶an granites of Dartmoor, that on Trowlesworthy blush to a ruddy splendour, and elsewhere break beautifully in fair colour and fine grain through the coarser porphyritic stone, suffer a change, and out of their perishing constituents emerges kaolin, or china clay.
<p/>A river met this naked road, and at their junction the grey bridge of Cadworthy saddled Plym.
<p/>Beyond, like the hogged back of a brown bear, Wigford Down rolled above the gorges of Dewerstone, and further yet, retreated fields and forests, great uplifted plains, and sudden elevations that glimmered along their crests with the tender green of distant larch and beech.
<p/>The atmosphere was opalescent, milky, sweet, as though earth's sap, leaping to the last tree-tip and bursting bud, exuded upon air the very visible incense and savour of life.
<p/>Running water and lifting lark made the music of this hour; and at one spot on the desert a girl's voice mingled with them and enlarged the melody, for it was gentle and musical and belonged to the springtime.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat high on Trowlesworthy, where the rushes chatter and where, to their eternal treble, the wind strikes deep organ music from the forehead of the tor.
<p/>From the clefts of the rocks around her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), where foxes homed sometimes and the hawk made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nest, there hung now russet tassels and tufts of dead lady-fern; and above this rack of the old year sprang dark green aigrettes of the new.
<p/>Stonecrops and pennyworts also flourished amid the uncurling fronds; aloft, the heath and whortle made curls for the great tor's brow; below, to the girl's feet, there sloped up boulders that shone with fabric of golden-brown mosses and dappled lichens, jade-green and grey.
<p/>The woodsorrel had climbed hither, and its frail bells and sparkling trefoils glittered on the earth.
<p/>The sun shone with a thready lustre over the million flattened dead rushes roundabout this place, and its light spread out upon them into a pool of pale gold.
<p/>Thus a radiance as of water extended here and the wind, fretting all this death, heightened the deception; while the scattered rocks shone brilliantly against so much reflected light and looked like boulders half submerged at the fringe of a glittering sea.
<p/>The girl laughed and gazed down at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) home.
<p/>It was a squat grey building half-way between the red tor and the distant bridge.
<p/>It stood amid bright green crofts, and beside it was a seemly hayrick and an unseemly patch of rufous light that stared--hideous as a bloodshot eye--from the harmonious textures of the waste.
<p/>There a shippen under an iron roof sank to rusty dissolution.
<p/>Here was Trowlesworthy Farm and a great rabbit warren that extended round about it.
<p/>Milly Luscombe lived at Trowlesworthy with an uncle and aunt.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) was accustomed to work very hard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) living, but for the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) did not work.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) only breathed the breath of spring and talked of love.
<p/>Beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) sat a sturdy youth with a red face and a little budding flaxen moustache.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) countenance was not cast in a cheerful mould.
<p/>Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) frowned and gazed gloomily out of large grey eyes at the valley beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I axed father in plain words if I might be tokened to you--of course, that was if you said `yes'--and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) answered as plainly that I might not.
<p/>You see, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was terrible up in years afore he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) got married himself, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) thinks a man's a fool to go into it young.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How old was he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forty-five to the day.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'s seventy next month, though he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) don't feel or look anything like so much.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'s full of old, stale sayings about marrying in haste and repenting at leisure: and such like.
<p/>So there it is, Milly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl nodded.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) was a dark maiden with brown eyes and a pretty mouth.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) sniffed rather tearfully and wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) eyes with the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) sun-bonnet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Belike your father only waited so long because the right one didn't come.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) found your mother, I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) married her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) quick enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) didn't.
<p/>They was tokened when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was forty, and kept company for five years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That ban't loving,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it ban't!
<p/>And yet father isn't what you might call a hard man.
<p/>Far from it, to all but me.
<p/>A big-hearted, kindly creature and a good father, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could only understand more.
<p/>Like a boy in some things.
<p/>I'm sure I feel a lot older than him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sometimes.
<p/>If 'twas Ned now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>)'d be friendly and easy as you please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does Mrs. Baskerville say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)'s on our side, and so's my sisters.
<p/>Polly and May think the world of you.
<p/>'Tisn't as if I was like my brother Ned--a lazy chap that hates the sight of work.
<p/>I stand to work same as father himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knows that; and when there's anything calling to be done, 'tis always, `Where be Rupert to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>But lazy as Ned is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>)'d let him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) marry to-morrow.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Baskerville's frighted of losing you from Cadworthy, Rupert.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man looked out where a wood rose south of the bridge, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's farm lifted its black chimneys above the trees.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tells me I'm his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right hand; and yet refuses, though this is the first thing that ever I've asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suffer it if you promised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) done, and not marry for five years?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll promise no such thing.
<p/>Father seems to think 'tis all moonshine, but I shall have another go at him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) comes home next week.
<p/>Till then I shan't see you no more, for I've promised myself to get through a mighty pile of work--just to astonish him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The harder you work, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'ll want you to bide at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that I mind you working.
<p/>All the best sort work--I know that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must work--no credit to me.
<p/>I'm like father there.
<p/>I ban't comfortable if I don't get through a good lump of work in the day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with large admiration.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Mr. Baskerville gone to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Bideford for the wrestlin' matches.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) always stands stickler when there's a big wrestlin'.
<p/>Such a famous man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was at it--champion of Devon for nine years.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) retired after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was married.
<p/>But now, just on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seventieth birthday, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s as clever as any of 'em.
<p/>'Twas his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) great trouble, I do believe, that neither me nor Ned ever shaped well at it.
<p/>But we haven't got his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) weight.
<p/>We take after my mother's people and be light built men--compared to father.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pity May weren't a boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Milly/Milly Luscombe/Luscombe</b></font>)</div>said Milly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>)'s got weight enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) admitted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>)'s the very daps of father.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>)'ll be a whacker when she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) grows up.
<p/>'Tis a nuisance for a woman being made so terrible beamy.
<p/>But there 'tis--and a happier creature never had to walk slow up a hill.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Silence fell for a while between them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must wait and hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) declared at last.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't change, Rupert--you know that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right well I know it, and more shan't I.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're just turned twenty-three and I'm eighteen.
<p/>After all, we've got plenty of time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Milly/Milly Luscombe/Luscombe</b></font>)</div>said Milly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so.
<p/>But that's no reason why for we should waste it.
<p/>'Tis all wasted till I get you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) hand out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) caught it and held it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It might be a long sight worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) said.
<p/>'''Tis only a matter of patience.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no need for patience, and there lies the cruelty.
<p/>However, I'll push him (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) hard when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) comes home.
<p/>Tokened I will be to `e--not in secret, but afore the nation.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Two men riding up over.
<p/>Go a bit further off, there's a dear.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rupert/Rupert Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Rupert looked where she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) pointed, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) showed no little astonishment and concern.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Lord!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) exclaimed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If 'tisn't my Uncle Humphrey Baskerville; and Mark along with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>).
<p/>What the mischief sent them here, of all ways?
<p/>Can't we hide?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But no hiding-place offered.
<p/>Therefore the young people rose and walked boldly forward.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>)'s going out to Hen Tor to look at they ruins, I reckon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Milly/Milly Luscombe/Luscombe</b></font>)</div>said Milly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I met your cousin Mark a bit ago, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) told me his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) father was rather interested in that old rogues-roost of a place they call Hen Tor House.
<p/>Why for I can't say; but that's where they be riding, I doubt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>Two men on ponies arrived as she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) spoke, and drew up beside the lovers.
<p/>The elder exhibited a cast of countenance somewhat remarkable.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) was a thin, under-sized man with grey hair.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) narrow, clean-shorn face sloped wedge-shaped to a pointed chin, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) mouth was lipless and very hard.
<p/>Grotesquely large black eyebrows darkened his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) forehead, but they marked no arch.
<p/>They were set in two patches or tufts, and moved freely up and down over a pair of rather dim grey eyes.
<p/>The appearance of dimness, however, was not real, for Humphrey Baskerville possessed good sight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was sixty-three years old, and a widower.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) passed for a harsh, secretive man, and lived two miles from his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) elder brother, Vivian Baskerville, of Cadworthy.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) household consisted of himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) son Mark, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) housekeeper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Uncle Humphrey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rupert/Rupert Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Rupert, taking the bull by the horns.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know Milly Luscombe, don't you?
<p/>Morning, Mark.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Baskerville's black tufts went up and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) slit of a mouth elongated.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's this then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fooling up here with a girl--you?
<p/>I hope you're not taking after your good-for-nothing brother?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Needn't fear that, uncle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How's Mr.
<p/>Luscombe?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>asked the old man abruptly, turning to the girl.
<p/>Milly feared nobody--not even this much-feared and mysterious person--and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) and patted his (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) old pony's neck as she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) answered--  <div class="bookquote">``Very well, thank you, Mr. Baskerville, and I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)'d hope you are the same.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The tufts came down and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) looked closely at her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You playing truant too--eh?
<p/>Well, why not?
<p/>'Tis too fine a day for work, perhaps.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it is, then.
<p/>Even your old blind pony knows that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only blind the near side,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) can see more with one eye than many humans can with both.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) name, please?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.
<p/>Never gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rupert/Rupert Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked a little way forward, while Rupert stopped behind and spoke to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) cousin Mark.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you like that boy very much--eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>said the old man drily and suddenly to Milly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) coloured up and nodded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense and foolery!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If 'tis, I wouldn't exchange it for your sense, Mr.
<p/>Baskerville.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) made a deep grunt, like a bear.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the pert way childer speak to the old folk now--is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Even you was in love once?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense and foolery--nonsense and foolery!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you do different if you could go back?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) did not answer the question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt you're too good for Rupert Baskerville,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)'s too good for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) stands to work--I grant that.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)'s young, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)'s foolish, like all young things.
<p/>Think better of it.
<p/>Keep away from the young men.
<p/>Work--work--work your fingers to the bone.
<p/>That's the only wise way.
<p/>I'm going to look at yonder ruin on the side of Hen Tor.
<p/>I may build it up again and live there and die there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!
<p/>Leave Hawk House, Mr.
<p/>Baskerville?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?
<p/>'Tis too much in the world for me and Mark.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'''Tis the loneliest house in these parts.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too much in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) repeated.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nonsense and foolery, if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawk</b></font>) said calmly; <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure love-making be all plain common-sense compared to that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) pulled up and regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawk</b></font>) with a grim stare.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've found somebody to-day that isn't afraid of me, seemingly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why for should I be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For no reason, except that most others are.
<p/>What do they all think?
<p/>I'll tell you; they think I'm wrong here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) tilted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) black wide-awake hat and tapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) forehead.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely never!
<p/>The folk only be frightened of your great wittiness--so I believe.
<p/>Rupert always says that you are terrible clever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That shows he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>)'s a terrible fool.
<p/>Don't you mate with a fool, Milly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll promise that anyway, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) spoke with perfect self-possession and interested the old man.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was interested, and turned upon himself impatiently and shouted to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, boy!
<p/>What are you dawdling there for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mark/Mark Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Mark instantly dug his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) heels into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) pony and followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) father.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) was a youthful edition of the elder, with a difference.
<p/>Humphrey was ill-clad, and Mark was neat.
<p/>Humphrey's voice was harsh and disagreeable; Mark's was soft and almost womanly.
<p/>Mark also had a smooth face and heavy eyebrows; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) features were clearer cut, more delicate; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) eyes were blue and beautiful.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) had a manner somewhat timid and retiring.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) was not a cringing man, but a native deference guided him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) in all dealings with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) kind.
<p/>Before starting, Mr. Baskerville stopped, drew a letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) pocket, and called to Rupert.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take this to my brother Vivian, will you?
<p/>I was going to leave it on the way back, but I'll not waste his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The youth</b></font>)</div><p/>The youth came forward and took the letter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father's away to Bideford--standing stickler for the wrestlin',''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God!
<p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) age!
<p/>Can't an old man of seventy find nothing better and wiser to do than run after childish things like that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The son</b></font>)</div><p/>The son was silent, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) uncle, with a snort of deep disdain, rode forward.
<p/>'''Tis about the birthday,'' Rupert explained to Milly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In June father will turn seventy, and there is to be a rare fuss made, and a spread, and all the family to come round him (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) at Cadworthy.
<p/>Of course, Uncle Nat will come.
<p/>In fact, 'twas his (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) idea that we should have a celebration about it; but I doubt if Uncle Humphrey will.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)'d think such a thing all rubbish, no doubt, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)'s against every sort of merry-making.
<p/>You see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) went just now when I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) father was gone to the wrestlin' matches.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you mind him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) too much, all the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Milly/Milly Luscombe/Luscombe</b></font>)</div>said Milly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looks terrible grim and says dreadful things, but I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s half in earnest.
<p/>I ban't feared of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and never will be.
<p/>Don't you be neither.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>They left the tor and proceeded to the girl's home beneath.
<p/>The close-cropped turf of the warrens spread in a green and resilient carpet under their feet; and, flung in a mighty pattern upon it, young red leaves of whortleberry broke through and spattered the miles of turf with a haze of russet.
<p/>Rupert said farewell at the entrance; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) hastened homeward and presently reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) family circle as it was preparing to dine.
<p/>Hester Baskerville, the wife of Vivian, was a quiet, fair woman of fine bearing and above middle height.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was twenty years younger than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband, but the union had been a happy and successful one in every respect, and the woman's mild nature and large patience had chimed well with the man's strong self-assertion, narrow outlook, and immovable opinions.
<p/>Kindness of heart and generosity of spirit distinguished them both; and these precious traits were handed to the children of the marriage, six in number.
<p/>Ned Baskerville, the eldest son, was considered the least satisfactory and the best looking.
<p/>Then came Rupert, a commonplace edition of Ned, but worth far more as a responsible being.
<p/>These men resembled their mother and both lived at home.
<p/>Young Nathan Baskerville followed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was a sailor and seldom seen at Cadworthy.
<p/>The two girls of this family succeeded Nathan.
<p/>May and Polly were like their father--of dark complexion and inclined to stoutness; while the baby of the household was Humphrey, a youngster of thirteen, called after the dreaded uncle.
<p/>All save Nat, the sailor, were at table when Rupert entered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) letter, and all showed keenest interest to learn whether Mr. Baskerville of Hawk House had accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) invitation.
<p/>Rupert handed the letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) mother, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was about to put it aside until her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband's return; but her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to open it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such a terrible exciting thing, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said stout May.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Us never won't sleep a wink till us knows.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope to the Lord he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) isn't coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>declared Ned.
<p/>''`Twill spoil all--a regular death's head he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>)'ll be, and us shan't dare to have an extra drop of beer or a bit of fun after with the girls.''
<p/>Beer and a bit of fun with the girls' represented the limit of Edward Baskerville's ambitions; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gratified them with determination when opportunity offered.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) father was blind to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) faults and set him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on a pedestal above the rest of the family; but his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother felt concern that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eldest son should be so slight a man.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lived in hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might waken to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) responsibilities and justify existence.
<p/>Ned was unusually well-educated, and would do great things some day in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) father's opinion; but the years passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) was now twenty-five, and the only great thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) had done was twice to become engaged to marry and twice to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) mind.
<p/>None denied him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) a rare gift of good looks; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) fine figure, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) curly hair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) twinkling eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) mouth, when it smiled, proved attractive to many maidens.
<p/>Mrs. Baskerville left a spoon in the large beef-steak pudding and read her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) brother-in-law's letter, while a cloud of steam ascended to the kitchen ceiling.
<p/>``DEAR BROTHER VIVIAN,  ``You ask me to come and eat my dinner with you on the twenty-eighth day of June next, because on that day you will be up home seventy years old.
<p/>If you think 'tis a fine thing to find yourself past three score and ten--well, perhaps it is.
<p/>You can't go on much longer, anyway, and journey's end is no hardship.
<p/>At a first thought I should have reckoned such a birthday wasn't much to rejoice over; but you're right and I'm wrong.
<p/>A man may pride himself on getting so well through with the bulk of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life and reaching nigh the finish with so few thorns in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet and aches in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart as what you have.
<p/>I'll come.
<p/>``Yours faithfully, <div class="bookquote">``HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>A mournful sound like the wind in the trees went up from Uncle Humphrey's nephews and nieces.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be damned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>said Ned.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) won't come after all, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) hears Uncle Nat is coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>suggested May.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was always hopeful.
<p/>Mrs. Baskerville turned and put the letter on the mantel-shelf behind an eight-day clock.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) sat down and began to help the pudding.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must make him (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) as welcome as we can, for father's sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said.
<p/>CHAPTER II  The hamlet of Shaugh Prior, a gift to the monks of Plympton in time past, stands beneath Shaugh Moor at the edge of a mighty declivity.
<p/>The Church of St. Edward lifts its battlemented tower and crocketed pinnacles above a world of waste and fallow.
<p/>It is perched upon a ridge and stands, supported by trees and a few cottages, in a position of great prominence.
<p/>The scant beauty that this holy place possessed has vanished under restoration; but there yet remain good bells, while a notable font-cover, cast forth by vanished vandals, is now returned to its use.
<p/>Round about the church dark sycamores shine in spring, and at autumn drop their patched and mottled foliage upon the dust of the dead.
<p/>Broad-bosomed fields ascend to the south; easterly a high road climbs to the Moor, and immediately north of Shaugh the slopes of High Down lead by North Wood to Cadworthy Farm and Cadworthy Bridge beyond it.
<p/>From High Down the village and its outlying habitations may be perceived at a glance.
<p/>The cots and homesteads converge and cluster in, with the church as the central point and heart of the organisation.
<p/>Around it dwellers from afar are come to sleep through their eternal night, and a double row of slates, like an amulet, girdles the ancient fane.
<p/>Here and there flash white marble in the string of grey above the graves of the people; and beside the churchyard wall stand heaped a pack of Time's playing cards--old, thin, and broken slates from graves forgotten--slates and shattered slabs that have fallen away from the unremembered dust they chronicled, and now follow into oblivion the bones they marked.
<p/>A school, a rectory, `The White Thorn' inn, and a dozen dwellings constitute Shaugh Prior, though the parish extends far beyond these boundaries; and on this spring day, one thrush warbling from a lilac bush at a cottage door, made music loud enough to fill the hamlet.
<p/>Undershaugh Farm stood near on the great hill that fell westerly to Shaugh Bridge, at watersmeet in the valley; and upon the land hard by it, two men tramped backward and forward, crossing and re-crossing in the bare centre of a field.
<p/>They were working over sown mangold and enriching the seed under their feet by scattering upon it a fertile powder.
<p/>The manure puffed from their hands in little golden clouds under the sunlight.
<p/>The secret of this mixture belonged to one man, and none grew such mangolds as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could grow.
<p/>Undershaugh was the property of Nathan Baskerville, innkeeper, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had let it for twenty years to a widow; but Mr. Baskerville took an active personal interest in the welfare of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) property, and Mrs. Priscilla Lintern, his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) tenant, was very well pleased to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) advice on all large questions of husbandry and rotation.
<p/>As did the rest of the world, she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) worth and wisdom.
<p/>Nathan Baskerville had original ideas, and these were a source of ceaseless and amicable argument between him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) elder brother, Vivian Baskerville, of Cadworthy.
<p/>But Mr. Nathan's centre of activity and nidus, from which his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) enterprises and undertakings took shape and separate being, was `The White Thorn' public-house.
<p/>Here, at the centre of the little web of Shaugh Prior, he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) busy and prosperous life.
<p/>Nothing came amiss to him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>); nothing seemed to fail in his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) hands.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) had a finger in fifty pies, and men followed his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) lead as a matter of course, for Nathan Baskerville was never known to make a bad bargain or faulty investment.
<p/>Nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) good luck to himself.
<p/>All men could win his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) ear; the humblest found him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) kind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) would invest a pound for a day labourer as willingly as ten for a farmer.
<p/>After five-and-twenty years in Shaugh Prior he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had won the absolute trust of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) neighbours.
<p/>All eyes brightened at his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) name.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was wont to say that only one living man neither believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nor trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that man, as luck will have it, is my own brother Humphrey,''  (<font color='red'><b>the innkeeper</b></font>)</div>the innkeeper would confess over his (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) bar to regular visitors thereat.
<p/>'''Tis no great odds, however, and I don't feel it so much as you might think, because Humphrey Baskerville is built on a very uncomfortable pattern.
<p/>If 'twas only me he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) mistrusted, I might feel hurt about it; but 'tis the world, and therefore I've got no right to mind.
<p/>There's none--none he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) would rely upon in a fix--a terrible plight for a man that.
<p/>But I live in hopes that I'll win him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) round yet.''
<p/>The folk condoled with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and felt a reasonable indignation that this most large-hearted, kindly, and transparent of spirits should rest under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own brother's suspicion.
<p/>They explained it as the work of jealousy.
<p/>All Baskervilles had brains, and most were noted for good looks; but both gifts had reached their highest development and culmination in Nathan.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) was the handsomest and the cleverest of the clan; and doubtless Humphrey, a sinister and secret character, against whom much was whispered and more suspected, envied his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) brother's gifts and far-reaching popularity.
<p/>Nathan was sixty, the youngest and physically the weakest of the three brothers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) had a delicate throat which often caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) anxiety.
<p/>The men scattering manure upon the mangolds made an end of their work and separated.
<p/>One took some sacks and the pails used for the fertiliser.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) mounted a bare-backed horse that stood in a corner of the field, and rode away slowly to Undershaugh.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) companion crossed the stream beneath the village, mounted a hill beyond it, and presently entered `The White Thorn.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) was a well-turned, fair, good-looking youth in corduroys and black leathern leggings.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) wore no collar, but his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) blue cotton shirt was clean and made a pleasant contrast of colour with the brown throat that rose from it.
<p/>Young Lintern was the widow Lintern's only son and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) right hand at Undershaugh.
<p/>The men in the bar gave him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) good day, and Mr. Baskerville, who was serving, drew for him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) half a pint of beer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Heathman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So that's done.
<p/>And, mark me, 'twas worth the doing.
<p/>If you don't fetch home first prize as usual for they mangolds, say I've forgot the recipe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div><p/>'''Tis queer stuff,'' answered the youngster, <div class="bookquote">``and what with this wind blowing, my eyes and nose and throat's all full of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the youngster</b></font>)</div><p/>''`Twill do you no harm but rise a pleasant thirst.''
<p/>Mr. Baskerville had humour stamped at the wrinkled corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) bright eyes.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) face was genial and rubicund.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) wore a heavy grey beard, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) hair, though streaked with grey, was still dark in colour.
<p/>A plastic mouth that widened into laughter a thousand times a day, belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was rather above average height, sturdy and energetic.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had never known what it was to be weary in mind or body.
<p/>Behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) bar he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) wore no coat, but ministered in turned-up shirt sleeves that revealed fine hairy arms.
<p/>Young Ned Baskerville sat in the bar, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) spoke to Heathman Lintern.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have one with me, Heathman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was going down to your mother with a message, but now you can take it and save me the trouble.''
 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) uncle shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, boy--always the same with you.
<p/>Anybody as will save you trouble be your friend.
<p/>'Tis a very poor look-out, Ned; for let a certain party only get wind of it that you're such a chap for running from work, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'ll mighty soon come along and save you all trouble for evermore.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who might he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) be, Uncle Nat?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Old Nick, my fine fellow!
<p/>You may laugh, but Tommy Gollop here will bear me out, and Joe Voysey too, won't you, Joe?
<p/>They be both born and bred in the shadow of the church, and as well up in morals as grave-digging and cabbage-growing.
<p/>And they'll tell you that the devil's always ready to work for an idle man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gollop/Gollop</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gollop.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``True as truth itself.
<p/>But the dowl won't work for nought, any more than the best of us.
<p/>Long hours, I grant you--never tired him (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>), and never takes a rest--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>)'ll have his (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) wages; and Ned here knows what they be, no doubt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Ned laughed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall work hard enough come presently, when it gets to be worth while.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gollop/Gollop</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gollop spoke again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) was a stout man with a little grey beard, a flat forehead, barely indicated under his (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) low-growing, coarse hair, and large brown, solemn eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) sister were leading figures at Shaugh Prior, and took themselves and their manifold labours in a serious spirit.
<p/>Some self-complacency marked their outlook; and their perspective was faulty.
<p/>They held Shaugh Prior as the centre of civilisation, and considered that their united labours had served to place and helped to maintain it in that position.
<p/>Thomas Gollop was parish clerk and sexton; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) sister united many avocations.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) acted as pew-opener at the church; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was a sick-nurse and midwife; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) took temporary appointments as plain cook; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) posed as intelligencer of Shaugh Prior; and what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did not know of every man, woman, and child in the village, together with their ambitions, financial position, private relations, religious opinions, and physical constitutions, was not worth knowing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At times of large change like this, when we are threatened with all manner of doubts and dangers, 'tis well for every man among us to hold stoutly to religion and defy any one who would shake us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gollop/Gollop</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gollop.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For my part I shall strike the first blow, and let it be seen that I'm a man very jealous for the Lord, and the village and the old paths.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's going to happen?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Ned.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You talk as if Doomsday was coming.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gollop/Gollop</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Gollop.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When Doomsday comes, if I'm still here, I shall know how to handle it; but 'tis the new vicar.
<p/>A man is a man; and with a strange man 'tis only too terrible certain there will creep in strange opinions and a nasty hunger for novelty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what's worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Voysey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Voysey, <div class="bookquote">``a young man.
<p/>An old man I could have faced from my sixty-five years without fear; but how can you expect a young youth--full of the fiery silliness of the twenties--to understand that as I've been gardener at the vicarage for forty year, so in right and decency and order I ought to go on being gardener there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Voysey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have no fear, Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Baskerville.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If there's one thing among us that Mr. Masterman won't change, 'tis you, I'm sure; for who knows the outs and ins of the garden up the hill like you do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tommy Gollop/Tommy</b></font>)</div><p/>'''Tis true,'' admitted Tommy Gollop.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That land is like a human, you might say--stiff and stubborn and got to be coaxed to do its best; and I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>)'ll very soon see that only Voysey can fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>) beans and peas out of the soil, and that it's took him (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>) a lifetime to learn the trick of the place.

<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>)'s got any new-fangled fashion of worship, Shaugh will rise against him (<font color='blue'><b>Shaugh</b></font>) like one man.
<p/>After fifty-two years of the Reverend Valletort, we can't be blown from our fixed ways at a young man's breath; and I'm sure I do hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't want so much as a cobweb swept down, or else there'll be difficulties spring up around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like weeds after rain.''

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>) followed the Baskervilles.
<p/>CHAPTER III  Nathan Baskerville, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>) brother Humphrey, was a widower.
<p/>Very early in life he (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>) had married a young woman of good means and social position superior to his (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>) own.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>) handsome face and manifold charms of disposition won Minnie Stanlake, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>) a small fortune in her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) own right, together with the detestation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minnie</b></font>) whole family.
<p/>Husband and wife had lived happily, save for the woman's fierce and undying jealousy which extended beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) early grave.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) died childless at eight-and-twenty, and left five thousand pounds to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband on the understanding that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not marry again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) obeyed this condition, though it was vain in law, and presently returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own people.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) married life was spent at Taunton, as a general dealer, but upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's death he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) abandoned this business and set up another like it at Bath.
<p/>At five-and-thirty years of age he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) came back to Devonshire and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) native village.
<p/>Great natural energy kept him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) busy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dearly liked to conduct all manner of pettifogging business, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) good nature was such that the folk did not hesitate to consult him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) upon their affairs.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) legal attainments were considered profound, while his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shrewd handling of figures, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) personal prosperity, combined to place him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) on a pinnacle among the folk as a great financier and most capable man of business.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not lend money at interest, but was known more than once to have helped a lame dog over a stile.
<p/>Many kind things he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did, and no man spoke a bad word of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>People brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) their savings and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to invest them according to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) judgment.
<p/>They usually asked for no details, but received their interest regularly, and trusted Nathan Baskerville like the Bank of England.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was in truth a large-hearted and kindly spirit, who found his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) pleasure in the affection and also in the applause of the people.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) liked to figure among them as the first.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) loved work for itself and enjoyed the universal praise of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) attainments.
<p/>Mr. Gollop might delude himself into believing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) was the leading citizen of Shaugh; but the master of `The White Thorn' knew better.
<p/>Without undue vanity he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorn</b></font>) was not able to hide the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorn</b></font>) stood above others in the esteem of the countryside.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorn</b></font>) was not so rich as people thought, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorn</b></font>) had not laid foundations of such a fortune as they supposed during the years at Bath; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorn</b></font>) fostered the impression and the fame it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorn</b></font>).
<p/>It suited better his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorn</b></font>) native idiosyncrasy to tower among smaller men, than to be small amidst his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorn</b></font>) betters.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorn</b></font>) liked the round-eyed reverence of ploughboys and the curtsey of the school children.
<p/>The late vicar, a Tory of the early Victorian age, had contrived to let Mr. Baskerville perceive the gulf that existed between them; and that the more definitely because Nathan was a Nonconformist.
<p/>The publican professed strong Conservative principles, however, and the attitude of the last incumbent of Shaugh had caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Shaugh</b></font>) some secret annoyance; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Shaugh</b></font>) too hoped that with the advent of a younger man and modern principles this slight disability might vanish.
<p/>For the rest he (<font color='blue'><b>Shaugh</b></font>) rode to hounds, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Shaugh</b></font>) attitude in the hunting field was admitted to be exceedingly correct and tactful.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Shaugh</b></font>) had no known confidant and he (<font color='blue'><b>Shaugh</b></font>) seldom spoke about himself.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Shaugh</b></font>) had never married astonished many people exceedingly; but it was significant of the genuine affection and esteem entertained for him (<font color='blue'><b>Shaugh</b></font>) that none, even when they came to learn of his (<font color='blue'><b>Shaugh</b></font>) dead wife's bequest and its condition, ever imputed sordid motives to his (<font color='blue'><b>Shaugh</b></font>) celibacy.
<p/>Five thousand pounds was guessed to be but a small part of Mr. Baskerville's fortune, and, when the matter chanced upon local tongues, men and women alike were quite content to believe that not affection for money, but love for his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) dead partner, had proved strong enough to maintain Nathan in widowhood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) liked the company of women, and was never so pleased as when doing them a service.
<p/>For their part they admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) also and wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) well.
<p/>Mr. Baskerville not only owned `The White Thorn' and its adjacencies, but had other house property at Shaugh and in the neighbouring parish of Bickleigh.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) principal possession was the large farm of Undershaugh; and thither now he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) proceeded with his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) nephew, Ned Baskerville, on one side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) and young Heathman Lintern on the other.
<p/>According to his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) wont Nathan chattered volubly and suited the conversation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) listeners.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You young chaps must both join the football club, if there is one.
<p/>I'm glad to think new parson's that sort, for 'tis just the kind of thing we're wanting here.
<p/>You fellows, and a lot like you, spend too much time and money at my bar to please me.
<p/>You may laugh, Ned, but 'tis so.
<p/>And another thing I'd have you to know: so like as not we shall have a rifle corps also.
<p/>I've often turned my mind on it.
<p/>We must let this man see we're not all willingly behind the times, but only waiting for a bit of encouragement to go ahead with the best.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Ned pictured his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) own fine figure in a uniform, and applauded the rifle corps; and Heathman did the like.

 (<font color='red'><b>a chaps</b></font>)</div><p/>'''Tis a very good idea, and would help to make you and a few other round-backed chaps as straight in the shoulders as me,'' declared Ned complacently.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you may be straight,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the other with a laugh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly you've never been known yet to bend your shoulders to work.
<p/>A day's trout-fishing be the hardest job that ever you've taken on--unless courting the maidens be a hard job.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Ned laughed and so did his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) uncle.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're right there, Heathman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>declared Mr. Baskerville.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A lazy scamp you are, Ned, though your father won't see it; but nobody knows it better than the girls.
<p/>They like you very well for a fine day and a picnic by the river; but I can tell you this: they're getting to see through you only too well.
<p/>They don't want fair-weather husbands; but stout, hard fellows, like Heathman here, as have got brains and use 'em, and arms and legs and use 'em.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more use--you, than a pink and white china joney stuck on a mantelshelf,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div>said Heathman.
<p/>Whereupon Ned dashed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) and, half in jest, half in earnest, they wrestled by the roadside.
<p/>Mr. Baskerville looked on with great enjoyment, and helped presently to dust Heathman after he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had been cross-buttocked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That'll show 'e if I'm a pink and white puppet for a mantelpiece,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>declared Ned.
<p/>The other laughed and licked a scratch on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never thought you was so spry.
<p/>But let's have a whole day's ploughing over a bit of the five-acre field to Undershaugh, and see what sort of a man you are in the evening.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the other.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Got no use for the plough-tail myself.
<p/>Rupert will take you on at that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To see you wrestle puts me in mind of your father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>said Nathan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This generation can't call home his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) greatness, and beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) you're a shrimp to a lobster, Ned; but 'twas a grand sight to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) handle a man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) prime.
<p/>I mind actually getting him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) up to London once, because I named his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) name there among some sporting fellows and 'twas slighted.
<p/>They thought, being my brother, that I held him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) too high, though he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was champion of Devon at the time.
<p/>But my way is never to say nought with my tongue that I won't back with my pocket, and I made a match for thirty pounds a side for your father.
<p/>A Middlesex man called Thorpe, from down Bermondsey way, was chosen, and your father came up on a Friday and put that chap on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) back twice in five minutes, and then went home again fifteen pound to the good.
<p/>A very clever man too, was Thorpe, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) never wanted to have no more to do with your father.
<p/>Vivian weighed over fourteen stone in them days, and not a pound of fat in the lot, I believe.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) could have throwed down a tor, I reckon, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) could have got a hold on it.
<p/>But you fellows be after your mother's build.
<p/>The best of you--him (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) that's at sea--won't never draw the beam to twelve stone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>A tramp</b></font>)</div><p/>A tramp stopped Mr. Baskerville, touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) hat and spoke.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You gave me a bit of work harvesting two year ago, master, and you didn't pull much of a long face when I told you I wasn't fond of work as a rule.

<p/>Can 'e give me a job?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>Nathan was famous at making work for everybody, and loafers rarely appealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) in vain.
<p/>How such an exceedingly busy man could find it in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart to sympathise with drones, none knew.
<p/>It was another of the anomalies of Mr. Baskerville's character.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) often proved good for a square meal, a day's labour and a night's rest, as many houseless folk well knew.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll see about that later.

 (<font color='red'><b>Priscilla/Priscilla Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Priscilla Lintern met her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) landlord at the gate of Undershaugh.
<p/>They were on terms of intimacy, and nodded to each other in an easy and friendly manner.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) had been feeding poultry from a basin, and now set it down, wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) fingers on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) apron, and shook hands with Ned Baskerville.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How be you, then?
<p/>'Tis a longful time since you called on us, Master Ned.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm clever, thank you; and I see you are, Mrs. Lintern.
<p/>And I hope Cora and Phyllis be all right too.
<p/>Heathman here be growing as strong as a lion--ban't you, Heathman?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Lintern was a brown, good-looking woman of rather more than fifty.
<p/>For twenty years she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) had farmed Undershaugh, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) power of reserve surprised a garrulous village.
<p/>It was taken by the sensible for wisdom and by the foolish for pride.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) worked hard, paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) rent at the hour it was due, as Nathan often mentioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) credit, and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) own counsel.
<p/>Very little was known about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>), save that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) had come to Shaugh as a widow with three young children, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) was kind-hearted and might have married Mr. Gollop a year after her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) arrival, but had declined the honour.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) daughters were at dinner when the men entered, and both rose and saluted Ned with some self-consciousness.
<p/>Phyllis, the younger, was like her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) mother: brown, neat, silent and reserved; the elder was cast in a larger mould and might have been called frankly beautiful.
<p/>Cora was dark, with black eyes and a fair skin whose purity she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) took pains to preserve.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) was tall, straight and full in the bosom.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) mouth alone betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>), for the lips set close and they were rather thin; but people forgot them when she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) laughed and showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) pretty teeth.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) laugh again belied her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) lips, for it was gentle and pleasant.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) had few delusions for a maiden, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) worked hard.
<p/>To Cora belonged a gift of common-sense.
<p/>The girl lacked sentiment, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was shrewd and capable.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother's books and displayed a talent for figures.
<p/>It was said that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had the brains of the family.
<p/>Only Mr. Baskerville himself doubted it, and maintained that Cora's mother was the abler woman.
<p/>Phyllis was lost at all times in admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) more brilliant sister, but Heathman did not like Cora and often quarrelled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>).
<p/>Ned gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) message and asked for a drink of cider.
<p/>Thereupon Phyllis rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) dinner and went to fetch it.
<p/>But young Baskerville's eyes were on Cora while he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) drank.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) had the manner of a man very well accustomed to female society, and long experience had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) that nine girls out of ten found him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) exceedingly attractive.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) easy insolence won them against their will.
<p/>Such girls as demanded worship and respect found Ned not so agreeable; but those who preferred the male creature to dominate were fascinated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) sublimity and affectation of knowledge and worldly wisdom.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) pretended to know everything--a convincing attitude only among those who know nothing.
<p/>The talk was of a revel presently to take place at Tavistock.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what's your gown going to be, Phyllis?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Ned.
<p/>The gown of Phyllis did not interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) in the least, but this question was put as a preliminary to another, and when the younger sister told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) meant to wear plum-colour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) turned to Cora.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cora's got a lovely frock--blue muslin wi' little pink roses, and a straw hat wi' big pink roses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phyllis/Phyllis Lintern</b></font>)</div>said Phyllis.
<p/>Ned nodded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd go a long way to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) in such a beautiful dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and, mind, I'm to have a dance or two with you both.
<p/>There's to be dancing in the evening--not rough and tumble on the grass, but boards are to be laid down and everything done proper.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They chattered about the promised festivity, while Nathan and Mrs. Lintern, having discussed certain farm matters, spoke of another and a nearer celebration.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, my brother Vivian and I are of the good old-fashioned sort, and we're bent on the whole family meeting at a square feed, with good wishes all round, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) seventieth birthday.
<p/>To think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) turned seventy!
<p/>I can't believe it.
<p/>Yet Time won't stand still--not even with the busiest.
<p/>A family affair 'tis to be, and none asked outside ourselves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does Mr. Humphrey go?

<p/>We shall try our hardest to cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) up and get a drop of generous liquor into him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>).
<p/>I only hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) won't be a damper and spoil the fun.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)'s going.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall know that better afterwards.

 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Ned chimed in.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll never do that, Uncle Nat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>)'s too old to change now.
<p/>And Cousin Mark be going just the same way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>)'s getting such a silent, hang-dog chap, and no wonder, having to live with such a father.
<p/>I'd run away if I was him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>Nathan laughed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you'd almost rather work than keep along with your Uncle Humphrey,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) said.
<p/>'''Tis pretty well known I can work when I choose,'' declared Ned.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div>said Heathman, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) mouth full; <div class="bookquote">``and 'tis also pretty well known you never do choose.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>The elder Baskerville clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) hands.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One to you, Heathman!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ned can't deny the truth of that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>But Ned showed no concern.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall make up for lost time very easily when I do start,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got ideas, I believe, and they go beyond ploughing.
<p/>I'm like Cora here--all brains.
<p/>You may laugh, Uncle Nat, but you're not the only Baskerville with a head on your shoulders.
<p/>I'll astonish you yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will--you will--the day you begin to work, Ned; and the sooner the better.
<p/>I shall be very glad when it happens.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The women</b></font>)</div><p/>The women laughed, and Cora much admired Ned's lofty attitude.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) too had ambitions, and felt little sympathy with those who were content to labour on the soil.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) strove often to fire her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) brother and enlarge his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ambitions; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had the farmer's instinct, enjoyed physical work, and laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) airs and graces.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me Rupert,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div>said Heathman now.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>)'s like me--not much good at talking and ain't got no use for the girls, but a towser to work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The man who ain't got no use for the girls is not a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>declared Ned very positively.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're the salt of the earth--ban't they, Mrs.
<p/>Lintern?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) smiled and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) curiously, then at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) uncle; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) did not answer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>continued Ned, <div class="bookquote">``you're out when you say Rupert's like you; for hard worker that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>)'s found time for a bit of love-making.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Cora and Phyllis manifested instant excitement and interest at this news.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>)?

<p/>'Tis Milly Luscombe, if you must know.
<p/>A very nice little thing too in her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mighty fine oak for a girl's ivy--you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated the younger.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyway, Rupert be sweet on Milly, and father knows all about it, and won't hear of it.
<p/>So there's thunder in the air for the moment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>They discussed this interesting private news, but promised Ned not to retail it in any ear.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) left them and, with Nathan, returned to the village.
<p/>Ned, undeterred by Mr. Baskerville's raillery, began loudly to praise Cora as soon as they had passed beyond earshot of the farmhouse-door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``By Jove, she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>)'s a bowerly maiden and no mistake!
<p/>Not her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) like this side of Plymouth, I do believe.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>)'s a very handsome girl without a doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>admitted Nathan.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not, if I choose?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may be--now--more shame to you.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mark!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mark.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mark!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>repeated Ned, as though the notion was unthinkable.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have guessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) would rather have run out of the country than lift his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) eyes to a girl!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Reverend</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IV  The Reverend Dennis Masterman was a bachelor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) came to Shaugh full of physical energy and certain hazy resolutions to accomplish notable work among a neglected people.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) scholastic career was nugatory, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) intellect had offered no bar to his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) profession.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) was physically brave, morally infirm.
<p/>Therefore his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) sister, Alice Masterman, came to support him (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) and share his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) lot and complement his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) character.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) might indeed fly from cows, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) would not fly from parochial opposition.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) was strong where he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) was weak.
<p/>They were young, sanguine, and of gentle birth.
<p/>They enjoyed private means, but were filled with wholesome ardour to justify existence and leave the world better than they found it.
<p/>Dennis Masterman possessed interest, and regarded this, his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) first cure, as a stepping-stone to better things.
<p/>Shaugh Prior was too small for his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) natural energies and powers of endurance--so he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) sister; but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said that the experience would be helpful.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) also suspected that reform might not be a matter of energy alone.
<p/>One evening, a week after their arrival, they were planning the campaign and estimating the value of lay helpers, when two important visitors were announced.
<p/>A maiden appeared and informed the clergyman that Thomas Gollop and Eliza Gollop desired to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Show them into the common room,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>); then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) twisted a little bronze cross that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) wore at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) watchchain and regarded Miss Masterman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The parish clerk and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) sister--I wonder if you'd mind, Alice?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) asked.
<p/>For answer she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) work.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly.
<p/>Since you saw Joe Voysey alone and, not only engaged him (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>), but promised he (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>) might have a boy for the weeding, I feel--well, you are a great deal too easy, Dennis.
<p/>Gollop is a very masterful person, clearly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) sister, so I am told, is just the same.
<p/>You certainly must not see women alone.
<p/>They'll get everything they want out of you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, one wishes to strike a genial note,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) explained.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``First impressions count for such a lot with common people.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be genial by all means; I say nothing against that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's tackle them, then.
<p/>Gollop's a tremendous Conservative, but we must get Liberal ideas into him (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>), if we can--in reason.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div><p/>Dennis Masterman was tall, square-shouldered and clean-shaven.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) regarded himself as somewhat advanced, but had no intention of sowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) opinions upon the parish before the soil was prepared.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) considered his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) character to be large-minded, tolerant, and sane; and for a man of eight-and-twenty he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) enjoyed fair measure of these virtues.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) sister was plain, angular, and four years older than Dennis.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wore double eyeglasses and had a gruff voice and a perceptible beard.
<p/>The Gollops rose as the vicar and his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) sister appeared.
<p/>Miss Gollop was shorter and stouter than her (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) brother, but resembled him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good evening, your reverence; good evening, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parish clerk</b></font>)</div>said the parish clerk.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is my sister, Miss Eliza.
<p/>For faith, hope, and charity she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) standeth.
<p/>In fact, a leading light among us, though I say it as should not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Masterman/Masterman</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Masterman shook hands with the woman; his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) sister bowed only.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what does Miss Gollop do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Dennis.
<p/>''`Twould be easier to say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) don't do,'' answered Thomas.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>)'s butt-woman to begin with, or as you would call it, `pew-opener.'
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>)'s sick-nurse to the parish, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>)'s midwife, and, when free, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>)'ll do chores or cook for them as want her (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>).
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>)'s got a knowledge and understanding of the people round these parts as won't be beaten.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) was Mr. Valletort's right hand, wasn't you, Eliza?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Valletort</b></font>) said,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gollop/Eliza/Eliza Gollop</b></font>)</div>answered Miss Gollop.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) was not self-conscious, but bore herself as Fame's familiar and one accustomed to admiration.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) had estimated the force of the clergyman's character from his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) first sermon, and judged that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) brother would be a match for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) covertly regarded Miss Masterman, and perceived that here must lie any issue of battle that might arise.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you abide along with your brother, miss, or be you just settling him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) into the vicarage?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I live with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gollop/Eliza/Eliza Gollop</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gollop inclined her (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'm sure I hope, if I can serve you any way at any time, as you'll let me know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you.
<p/>Everybody can serve us: we want help from one and all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Masterman/Masterman</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Masterman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ezacally so!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Gollop</b></font>)</div><p/>said Thomas.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you must larn each man's value from those that know it--not by bitter experience.
<p/>Likewise with the women.
<p/>My sister can tell you, to threepence a day, what any female in this parish be good for; and as to the men, you'll do very well to come to me.
<p/>I know 'em all--old and young--and their characters and their points--good and bad, crooked and odd.
<p/>For we've got some originals among us, and I'm not going to deny it, haven't us, Eliza?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every place have,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Might we sit down?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>asked the man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'm of the bungy breed, as you see, and not so clever in our breathing as we could wish.
<p/>But we'm here to go through the whole law and the prophets, so to speak, and we can do it better sitting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div>answered Dennis.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dennis</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dennis</b></font>) watch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can give you an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dennis</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'm going to ride over to Bickleigh at nine o'clock, to see the vicar there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a very nice gentleman you'll find him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Gollop</b></font>)</div>declared Thomas.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, Bickleigh be but a little matter beside Shaugh Prior.
<p/>We bulk a good deal larger in the eyes of the nation, and can hold our heads so much the higher in consequence; but the Reverend Coaker is a very good, humble-minded man, and knows his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place in a way that's a high example to the younger clergymen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Masterman/Masterman</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Masterman cleared her (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) throat, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) voice was none the less gruff.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you will now tell us what you have come for.
<p/>We are busy people,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) said.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) brother deprecated this brevity and tried to tone it down, but Thomas accepted the lady's statement with great urbanity.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss be right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Busy as bees, I warrant--same as me and my own sister here.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not many,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gollop/Eliza/Eliza Gollop</b></font>)</div>said Miss Gollop.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always say, `Let's run about in this world; plenty of time to sit down in the next.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Gollop</b></font>)</div>added Thomas kindly, <div class="bookquote">``that your first sermon went down very suent.

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Gollop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some thought 'twas a sermon they'd heard afore, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gollop/Eliza/Eliza Gollop</b></font>)</div>said Miss Gollop; <div class="bookquote">``but no doubt they was wrong.''

<p/>Not another like it in the world, they say.

<p/>The famous font-cover, with its eight little snub-nosed saints and the Abbot elevated in the midst, was a special glory of St. Edward's.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant to speak of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>said the clergyman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The figure at the top has got more than his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) proper vestments on, Gollop.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hadn't noticed them; but since you say so--I'll look to it myself.
<p/>Where the vamp-dish be concerned I allow none to meddle.
<p/>It shall be done; but I must say again that I haven't noticed any cobwebs--not last Sunday.
<p/>Have you, Eliza?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Gollop</b></font>)</div><p/>said Thomas.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I have not,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sister.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dirt has clearly been there for months,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Masterman/Masterman</b></font>)</div>remarked Miss Masterman.
<p/>There was a painful pause, during which Miss Gollop gazed at the vicar's sister and then at the vicar.
<p/>'''Tis a well-known fact that spiders will spin,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) said vaguely, but not without intention.
<p/>The other woman ignored her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and turned to Thomas.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you be so good as to proceed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and gladly, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'll begin with the Gollops, since they've done as much for this parish as anybody, living or dead.
<p/>My father was parish clerk afore me, and a very remarkable man, wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Eliza?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A remarkable man with a large faith in the power of prayer, was father.
<p/>You don't see such faith now, worse luck.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) believed more than even I hold to, or my sister, either.
<p/>You might say that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wasn't right always; but none ever dared to doubt the high religious quality of the man.
<p/>But there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was--a pillar of the Church and State, as they say.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to help his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money a bit by the power of prayer; and they fetched childer sick of the thrush to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d tak 'em up the church tower and hold 'em over the battlements, north, south, east, and west--while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said the Lord's Prayer four times.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d get a shilling by it every time, and was known to do twenty of 'em in a good year, though I never heard 'twas a very quick cure.
<p/>But faith moves mountains, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may have done more good than appeared to human eyes.
<p/>And then in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very near let a heavy babby drop over into the churchyard--just grabbed hold of un by a miracle and saved un.
<p/>So that proper terrified the old man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never done another for fear of some lasting misfortune.
<p/>Not but what a few devilish-natured people said that if 'twas knowed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let the childer fall now and again, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d brisk up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) business a hundred per centum.
<p/>Which shows the evil-mindedness of human nature.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll have no gross superstition of that sort here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Masterman/Masterman</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Masterman firmly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No more won't I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Gollop</b></font>)</div>answered Thomas.
<p/>''`Other times, other manners,' as the saying is.
<p/>Have no fear.
<p/>The church is very safe with me and Eliza for watch-dogs.
<p/>Well, so much for my father.
<p/>There was only us two, and we never married--too busy for that.
<p/>And we've done no little for Shaugh Prior, as will be better told you in good time by other mouths than ours.''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stopped to take breath, and Miss Masterman spoke.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother will tell you that with regard to parish clerks the times are altering too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``However, what my brother has got to say regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) intentions can come later.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't want a clerk, I've done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gollop/Gollop</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Gollop blankly.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall manage without women in the choir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Masterman/Masterman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Masterman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may think so, but I doubt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gollop/Eliza/Eliza Gollop</b></font>)</div>answered Eliza Gollop almost fiercely.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have to manage without anybody in the church also, if you be for up-turning the whole order of divine service!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) was excited, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) large bosom heaved.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not up-turning--not up-turning,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>declared the clergyman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Call it reorganisation.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be reasonable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Masterman/Masterman</b></font>)</div>urged Miss Masterman with admirable self-command.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are here to do our duty.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've only just begun.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--tenor bell among the ringers.
<p/>A very uneven-minded man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a wonderful ringer and wrapped up in tenor bell, as if 'twas a heathen idol.
<p/>In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'m not the good Christian he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might be, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll ring oftener than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll pray.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lots more.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Masterman/Masterman</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Masterman looked helplessly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) watch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can only trust that you two good people do not represent the parish,''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>continued the vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the worse.
<p/>However, it is well that we understand one another.
<p/>Next Sunday I shall invite my leading parishioners to meet me in the schoolroom on the following evening.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And only the men will be invited to the meeting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Masterman/Masterman</b></font>)</div>added Miss Masterman.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Masterman/Masterman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Masterman, and left them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be sure that we shall soon settle down,''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>prophesied the vicar.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you mean well, Gollop; and I mean well, too.

<p/>Then Dennis saw them to the door; they took their leave, and as they went down the vicarage drive, their voices bumbled together, like two slow, shard-borne beetles droning on the night.
<p/>CHAPTER V  Both the yeoman and gentle families of Devon have undergone a wide and deep disintegration during the recent past.
<p/>Many are swept away, and the downfall dates back beyond the eighteenth century, when war, dice, and the bottle laid foundations of subsequent ruin; but the descendants of many an ancient stock are still with us, and noble names shall be found at the plough-handle; historical patronymics, on the land.
<p/>The race of Baskerville had borne arms and stood for the king in Stuart times.
<p/>The family was broken in the Parliamentary Wars and languished for certain centuries; then it took heart and lifted head once more.
<p/>The three brothers who now carried on their line were doubly enriched, for their father had died in good case and left a little fortune behind him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); while an uncle, blessed with some tincture of the gipsy blood that had flowed into the native stock a hundred years before, found Devon too small a theatre for his (<font color='blue'><b>Devon</b></font>) activities and migrated to Australia.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Devon</b></font>) died a bachelor, and left his (<font color='blue'><b>Devon</b></font>) money to his (<font color='blue'><b>Devon</b></font>) nephews.
<p/>Thus the trio began life under fortunate circumstances; and it appeared that two had prospered and justified existence; while concerning the other little could be affirmed, save a latent and general dislike founded on vague hearsay.
<p/>They were different as men well could be, yet each displayed strong individuality and an assertive temperament.
<p/>All inherited some ancestral strength, but disparities existed between their tastes, their judgments, and their ambitions.
<p/>Vivian Baskerville was generous, self-opinionated, and kind-hearted.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) loved, before all things, work, yet, in direct opposition to this ruling passion, tolerated and spoiled a lazy eldest son.
<p/>From the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) family he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) exacted full measure of labour and very perfect obedience.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was a man of crystallised opinions--one who resented change, and built on blind tradition.
<p/>Nathan Baskerville had a volatile and swift-minded spirit.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was sympathetic, but not so sympathetic as his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) manner made him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) appear.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had a histrionic knack to seem more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) felt; yet this was not all acting, but a mixture of art and instinct.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) trusted to tact, to a sense of humour with its accompanying tolerance, and to swift appraisal of human character.
<p/>Adaptability was his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) watchword.
<p/>Humphrey Baskerville personified doubt.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) apparent chill indifference crushed the young and irritated the old.
<p/>An outward gloominess of manner and a pessimistic attitude to affairs sufficed to turn the folk from him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) seemed the spirit of negation made alive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was, nevertheless, a steadfast Christian, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) dark mind, chaotic though it continued to be even into age, enjoyed one precious attribute of chaos and continued plastic and open to impressions.
<p/>None understood this quality in him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) did not wholly understand it himself.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was ever seeking for content, and the search had thus far taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) into many fruitless places and landed him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) in blind alleys not a few.
<p/>These adventures, following his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) wife's death, had served to sour him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) in some directions; and the late ripening of a costive but keen intelligence did not as yet appear to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) neighbours.
<p/>It remained to be seen whether time would ever achieve a larger wisdom, patience, and understanding in him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)--whether considerable mental endowments would ultimately lift him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) nearer peace and content, or plunge him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) deeper into despondence and incorrigible gloom.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was as interesting as Nathan was attractive and Vivian, obvious.
<p/>The attitude of the brothers each to the other may be recorded in a sentence.
<p/>Vivian immensely admired the innkeeper and depended no little upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) judgment in temporal affairs, but Humphrey he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) did not understand; Nathan patronised his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) eldest brother and resented Humphrey's ill-concealed dislike; while the master of Hawk House held Vivian in regard, as an honest and single-minded man, but did not share the world's esteem for Nathan.
<p/>They always preserved reciprocal amenities and were accounted on friendly terms.
<p/>Upon the occasion of the eldest brother's seventieth birthday, both Vivian and Nathan stood at the outer gate of Cadworthy and welcomed Humphrey when he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) alighted off his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) semi-blind pony.
<p/>Years sat lightly on the farmer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) was a man of huge girth and height above the average.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) had a red moon face, with a great fleshy jowl set in white whiskers.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) brow was broad and low; his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) small, pig-like eyes twinkled with kindliness.
<p/>It was a favourite jest with him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) weighed within a stone or two as much as his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) brothers put together.
<p/>They shook hands and went in, while Mark and Rupert took the ponies.
<p/>The three brothers all wore Sunday black; and Vivian had a yellow tie on that made disharmony with the crimson of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) great cheeks.
<p/>This mountain of a man walked between the others, and Nathan came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) ear and Humphrey did not reach his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>The last looked a mere shadow beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seventy year to-day, and have moved two ton of sacks--a hundredweight to the sack--`twixt breaksis and noon.
<p/>And never felt better than this minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) told them.
<p/>'''Tis folly, all the same--this heavy work that you delight in,'' declared Nathan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure Humphrey's of my mind.
<p/>You oughtn't to do such a lot of young man's work.
<p/>'Tis foolish and quite uncalled for.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The young men can't do it, maybe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vivian be three men rolled into one--with the strength of three for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) threescore and ten years.
<p/>But you're in the right.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)'s too old for these deeds.
<p/>There's no call for weight-lifting and all this sweating labour, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) is such a mighty man of his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) hands still.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Baskerville of Cadworthy laughed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You be such brainy blids--the pair of you--that you haven't got no patience with me and my schoolboy fun.
<p/>But, then, I never had no intellects like you--all ran into muscle and bone.
<p/>And 'tis my pleasure to show the young generation what strength be.
<p/>The Reverend Masterman preached from a very onusual text Sunday, `There were giants in those days,' it was--or some such words, if my memory serves me.
<p/>And Rupert and May, as were along with me, said as surely I belonged to the giant race!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) laughed with a loud, simple explosion of ingenuous merriment, and led the way to the parlour.
<p/>There his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) wife, in black silk, welcomed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brothers-in-law and received their congratulations.
<p/>Humphrey fumbled at a parcel which he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) produced from his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) breast.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) untied the string, wound it up, and put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>'''Tis a book as I heard well spoken of,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's only one Book for you and me, I believe, Vivian; but an old man as I know came by this, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) said 'twas light in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) darkness; so I went and bought a copy for you by way of something to mark the day.
<p/>Very like 'tis all rubbish, and if so you can throw it behind the fire.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sermons, and good ones without a doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>answered the farmer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very fond of sermons, and I'll lay on to 'em without delay and let you know what I think.
<p/>Not that my opinion of such a thing do count; but I can tell to a hair if they'm within the meaning of Scripture, and that be all that matters.
<p/>And thank you kindly, I'm sure.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) says that your parson is a Radical, and will bring down dreadful things on the parish.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Old fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>answered Humphrey.
<p/>'''Tis just what we want, within the meaning of reason, to have a few of the cobwebs swept away.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you're a Radical too, and all for sweeping away,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>argued his (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) eldest brother doubtfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm for folly and nonsense being swept away, certainly.
<p/>I'm for all this cant about humility and our duty to our superiors being swept away.
<p/>I hate to see chaps pulling their hair to other men no better than themselves, and all that knock-kneed, servile rubbish.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>Nathan felt this to be a challenge.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We take off our hats to the blood in a man's veins, if 'tis blue enough--not to the man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And hate the man all the time, maybe--and so act a lie when we cap to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and pretend what isn't true.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You go too far,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>declared Nathan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say that we hate anything that's stronger than we are,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We hate brains that's stronger than our own, or pockets that's deeper.
<p/>The only folk that we smile upon honestly be those we reckon greater fools than ourselves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vivian/Vivian Baskerville/Mr. Vivian Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Vivian laughed loud at this.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a sharp tongue the man hath!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exclaimed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s wrong, for all that.
<p/>For if I only smiled at them who had less brains than myself, I should go glum from morn till night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say it, father!''
 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too humble-minded you be, and always will be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>'''Tis only a very wise man that knows himself for a fool, all the same,'' declared Nathan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``As for Humphrey here, maybe 'tis because men hate brains bigger than their own, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) says, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) hasn't got a larger circle of friends himself.
<p/>We all know he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)'s the cleverest man among us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div><p/>Humphrey was about to speak again, but restrained the inclination and turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) nieces who now appeared.
<p/>Polly lacked character and existed as the right hand of her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) mother; but May took physically after Vivian, and represented his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) first joy and the apple of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) eye.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) was a girl of great breadth and bulk every way.
<p/>The beauty of youth still belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) clean white and red face, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) yellow hair was magnificent; but it required no prophet to foretell that poor May, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) present colt-like life of physical activity decreased, must swiftly grow too vast for her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) own comfort or the temptation of the average lover.
<p/>The youngest of the family--his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) Uncle Humphrey's namesake--followed his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) sisters.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was a brown boy, well set up and shy.
<p/>Of all men he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) feared the elder Humphrey most.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) shook hands evasively.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't stare at the ceiling and the floor, but look me in the eyes.
<p/>I hate a chap as glances athwart his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) nose like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master of Hawk House.
<p/>Whereat the lesser Humphrey scowled and flushed.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) braced himself for the ordeal and stared steadily into his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) uncle's eyes.
<p/>The duel lasted full two minutes, and the boy's father laughed and applauded him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>At last young Humphrey's eyes fell.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey the elder.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You learn to keep your gaze on the eyes of other people, my lad, if you want to know the truth about 'em.
<p/>A voice will teach you a lot, but the eyes are the book for me--eh, Nathan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt there's a deal in that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if 'twas followed, perhaps we shouldn't take our hats off to certain people quite so often as we do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>added Humphrey, harking back to the old grievance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the good of being respectful to those you don't respect and ought not to respect?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The man's hungry!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vivian/Vivian Baskerville/Mr. Vivian Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>said Vivian.
<p/>'''Tis starvation making him (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) so crusty and so clever.
<p/>Come now, ban't dinner ready?''
<p/>Mrs. Baskerville had departed and Polly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hurry 'em up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vivian/Vivian Baskerville/Mr. Vivian Baskerville</b></font>)</div>cried Vivian, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) youngest son hastened to do so.
<p/>Meantime Nathan, who was also hungry, and who also desired to display agility of mind before his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) elder brother, resumed the argument with Humphrey and answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) last question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because we've everything to gain by being civil, and nought to gain by being otherwise, as things are nowadays.
<p/>Civility costs nothing and the rich expect it of the poor, and gentle expect it of simple.
<p/>Why not?
<p/>You can't mar them by being rude; but you can mar yourself.
<p/>`The golden rule for a pushing man is to be well thought upon.'
<p/>That's what our father used to say.
<p/>And it's sound sense, if you ask me.
<p/>Of course, I'm not speaking for us, but for the younger generation, and if they can prosper by tact and civility to their betters, why not?
<p/>We like the younger and humbler people to be civil to us; then why shouldn't they be civil to parson and squire?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How if parson be no good, and squire a drinker or a rascal?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's neither here nor there.
<p/>'Tis their calling and rank and the weight behind 'em.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Trash!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div><p/>said Humphrey sourly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let every man be weighed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) own balance and show himself what he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) is.
<p/>That's what I demand.
<p/>Why should we pretend and give people the credit of what they stand for, if they don't stand for it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For a lot of reasons--''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>began Nathan; then the boy Humphrey returned to say that dinner was ready.
<p/>They sat down, and through the steam that rose from a dish of ducks Humphrey looked at Nathan and spoke.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What reasons?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For your credit's sake you can't leave it there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will have it, you will have it--though this isn't the time or place; but Vivian must blame you, not me.
<p/>Life's largely a game of make-believe and pretence, and, right or wrong, we've got to suffer it.
<p/>We should all be no better than lonely monkeys or Red Indians, if we didn't pretend a bit more than we meant and say a bit more than we'd swear to.
<p/>Monkeys don't pretend, and what's the result?
<p/>They've all gone under.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vivian/Vivian Baskerville/Mr. Vivian Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>They wrangled until the food was on the plates, then Vivian, who had been puffing out his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) cheeks, rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) eyes and showing uneasiness in other ways, displayed a sudden irritability.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``God damn it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's have no more of this!
<p/>Be the meal to be sarved with no sauce but all this blasted nonsense?
<p/>Get the drink, Rupert.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>Nathan expressed instant regret and strove to lift the tone of the company.
<p/>But the cloud did not pass so easily.
<p/>Vivian himself soon forgot the incident; his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) children and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) wife found it difficult.
<p/>The young people, indeed, maintained a very dogged taciturnity and only talked among themselves in subdued tones.
<p/>May and Polly waited upon the rest between the intervals of their own meal.
<p/>They changed the dishes and went to and from the kitchen.
<p/>Rupert and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) youngest brother helped them, but Ned did not.
<p/>Some cheerfulness returned with the beer, and even Humphrey Baskerville strove to assist the general jollity; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) lacked the power.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) mind was of the discomfortable sort that cannot suffer opinions, believed erroneous, to pass unchallenged.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) expressed no more than doubt; sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) dissented forcibly to Nathan's generalities.
<p/>But after Vivian's heat at the beginning of the entertainment, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) brother from `The White Thorn' was cautious, and took care to raise no more dust of controversy.
<p/>The talk ran on the new vicar, and the master of Cadworthy spoke well of him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An understanding man, and for my part, though I can't pretend to like new things, yet I ban't going to quarrel for nothing.
<p/>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) likes to put the boys in surplices and make the maidens sit with the congregation, I don't see no great harm.
<p/>They can sing praises to God wi' their noses to the east just so easy as they can facing north.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well said,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>declared Humphrey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no patience with such fools as Gollop.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As one outside and after a different persuasion, I can look on impartial,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>declared Nathan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I think with you both that Masterman is a useful and promising man.
<p/>As for Gollop, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s the sort that can't see further than the end of the parish, and don't want to do so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For why?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d tell you there's nought beyond,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) foxes himself to think that the world can go on without change.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) fancies that he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) alone of us all be a solid lighthouse, stuck up to watch the waves roll by.
<p/>'Tis a sign of a terrible weak intellect to think that everybody's changeable but ourselves, and that we only be the ones that know no shadow of changing.
<p/>Yet I've seen many such men--with a cheerful conceit of themselves too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's lots like that--common as blackberries in my bar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>declared Nathan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Old fellows most times, that reckon they are the only steadfast creatures left on earth, while everybody else be like feathers blown about in a gale of change.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every mortal man and woman be bound to change,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>answered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother.
<p/>'''Tis the law of nature.
<p/>I'd give nought for a man of hard and fast opinions.
<p/>Such stand high and dry behind the times.''
<p/>But Vivian would not allow this.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, Humphrey; that won't do.
<p/>If us wasn't fixed and firm, the world couldn't go on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Vivian means we must have a lever of solid opinions to lift our load in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>explained Nathan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, no grown man wants to be flying to a new thing every day of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, like the young people do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The lever's the Bible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>declared Humphrey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've nought to do with any man who goes beyond that; but, outside that, there's a margin for change as the world grows, and 'tis vain to run your life away from the new facts the wise men find out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't hold with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vivian/Vivian Baskerville/Mr. Vivian Baskerville</b></font>)</div>declared Vivian.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At such a gait us would never use the same soap or wear the same clothes two years together.
<p/>If you'm going to run your life by the newspapers, you'm in the same case with the chaps and the donkey in the fable.
<p/>What father believed and held to, I shall believe and hold to; for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a better man than me and knowed a lot more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div><p/>Humphrey shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we all thought so, the world would stand still,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) replied.
<p/>'''Tis the very argument pushed in the papers to-day about teaching the young people.
<p/>'Tis said they must be taught just what their parents want for 'm to be taught.
<p/>And who knows best, I should like to know--the parents and guardians, as have finished their learning years ago and be miles behind-hand in their knowledge, or the schoolmasters and mistresses as be up to date in their larning and full of the latest things put into books?
<p/>There's no standing still with the world any more than there's standing still with the sun.
<p/>It can't be.
<p/>Law's against it.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must have change,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>admitted Nathan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For sure we must.
<p/>'Tis the only way to keep sweet--like water running forward.
<p/>If you block it in a pond, it goes stagnant; and if you block your brains, they rot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let us leave it at that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vivian/Vivian Baskerville/Mr. Vivian Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Vivian's wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, if you men have done your drink, you can go off and smoke while we tidy up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>But there was yet a duty to perform, and Nathan rose and whispered in Humphrey's ear.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think the time's come for drinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) health.
<p/>It must be done.
<p/>Will you propose it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) brother answered aloud.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nathan wants for me to propose your good health, Vivian.
<p/>But I ban't going to.
<p/>That sort of thing isn't in my line.
<p/>I wish you nought but well, and there's an end on't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll say a word,''  (<font color='red'><b>the innkeeper</b></font>)</div>declared the innkeeper, returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) place.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fill your glasses--just a drop more, Hester, you must drink--isn't it to your own husband?
<p/>And I say here, in this family party, that 'tis a proud and a happy thing to have for the head of the family such a man as our brother--your husband, Hester; and your father, you boys and girls.
<p/>Long may he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) be spared to stand up among us and set us a good example of what's brave and comely in man; long may he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be spared, I say, and from my heart I bless him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for a good brother and husband and father, and wish him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) many happy returns of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) birthday.
<p/>My love and honour to you, Vivian!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They all rose and spoke after the custom of the clan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My love and honour to you, brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My love and honour to you, Vivian Baskerville,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Love and honour to you, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys girls</b></font>)</div>murmured the boys and girls.
<p/>And Mark said, <div class="bookquote">``Love and honour to you, uncle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mark/Mark Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a gulching of liquor in the silence that followed, and Mr. Baskerville's little eyes twinkled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You silly folk!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``God knows there's small need of this.
<p/>But thank you all--wife, children, brothers, and nephew.
<p/>I be getting up home to my tether's end now, and can't look with certainty for over and above another ten birthdays or thereabouts; but such as come we'll keep together, if it pleases you.
<p/>And if you be drinking, then here's to you all at a breath--to you all, not forgetting my son Nathan that's sailing on the sea.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll write to Nat and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) every blessed word of it, and what we've had for dinner and all,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said May.
<p/>The company grew hilarious and Nathan, leaving them, went to the trap that had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) from Shaugh Prior and returned with a bottle.
<p/>'''Tis a pretty cordial,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and a thimbleful all round will steady what's gone and warm our hearts.
<p/>Not but what they'm warm enough already.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The liquor was broached and all drank but Humphrey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough's as good as a feast.
<p/>And you can saddle my pony, Mark.
<p/>I'm going home now.
<p/>I'm glad to have been here to-day; but I'm going now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>They pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) to remain, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) judged the invitation to be half-hearted.
<p/>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) was tranquil and amiable at leave-taking.
<p/>To Rupert he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) even extended an invitation.
<p/>Rupert was the only one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) brother's family for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) even pretended regard.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can come and see me when you've got the time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go for a walk along with you and hear what you have to say.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) rode off, but Mark stopped and finished the day with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) cousins.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) talked to Rupert and, with secret excitement, heard the opinions of May and Polly on the subject of Cora Lintern.
<p/>A very glowing and genial atmosphere settled over Cadworthy after the departure of Humphrey Baskerville.
<p/>Even the nervous Mark consented to sing a song or two.
<p/>The musical traditions of the Baskervilles had reawakened in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>), and on rare occasions he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) favoured his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) friends with old ballads.
<p/>But in church he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) never sang, and often only went there to ring the tenor bell.
<p/>Mr. Nathan also rendered certain comic songs, and May played the aged piano.
<p/>Then there was dancing and dust and noise, and presently the meal called `high tea.'
<p/>Hester Baskerville protested at last against her (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) brother-in-law's absurdities, for everybody began to roll about and ache with laughter; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) challenged her (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) criticism.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clever though you all are,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``no woman that ever I met was clever enough to play the fool.
<p/>'Tis only the male creature can accomplish that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No woman ever wanted to, I should hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered; and he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) retorted triumphantly--  <div class="bookquote">``There you are!
<p/>There's my argument in a nutshell!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was puzzled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What d'you mean by that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked, and, from the standpoint of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) nimble wit, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) roared.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There you are again!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't explain; but the lack in you be summed in the question.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'm a hopeless case,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We all laugh at you, and yet couldn't for the life of us tell what on earth 'tis we be laughing at.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the very highest art and practice of playing the fool!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) told them.
<p/>CHAPTER VI  Where Wigmore Down descends in mighty shoulders clad with oak, there meet the rivers Plym and Mew, after their diverse journeyings on Dartmoor.
<p/>The first roars wild and broken from its cradle aloft on the midmost waste, and falls with thunder under Cadworthy and beneath the Dewerstone; the other, as becomes a stream that has run through peaceful valleys by bridges and the hamlets of men, shall be found to wander with more gentle current before she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadworthy</b></font>) passes into the throbbing bosom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadworthy</b></font>) sister.
<p/>Above them, on a day in early summer, the hill ascended washed with light, spread hugely for the pomp of the leaf.
<p/>From Plym beneath, flashing arrowy under their lowermost branches, to the granite tonsure of the hill above, ten thousand trees ascended in a shining raiment of all greens--a garment that fitted close to the contours of each winding ridge, sharp cleeve, and uplifted knoll of the elevation that they covered.
<p/>Lustrous and shimmering, this forest garb exhibited every vernal tint that nature knows, for upon a prevalent, triumphant fabric of golden-green were cast particular jewels and patterns; against the oaken undertones, where they spread a dappled verdure of amber and carmine, there sprang the tardy ash, shone the rowan's brightness, sparkled the whitethorn at river's brink, and rose the emerald pavilions of the larch.
<p/>Beeches thrust their diaphanous foliage in veils athwart the shadows; here a patchwork of blue firs added new harmonies to the hill; here the glittering birch reflected light from every tiny leaf; and here the holly's sobriety was broken by inflorescence and infant foliage, young and bright.
<p/>The forest spread its new-born leaves under a still, grey evening, upon which, suddenly, the sun thrust through before it sank.
<p/>Shafts of light, falling from west to east upon the planes of the woods, struck out a path of sudden glory along the pine-tops and thrust down in rain of red gold even to the river's face; while on Dewerstone's self, where it towered above the trees and broke the green with grey, this gracious light briefly brooded and flashed genial into dark crevices and hidden nests of birds.
<p/>The great rock falls by abrupt acclivity to the water; it towers with pinnacle and peak aloft.
<p/>Planted in the side of the forest it stands veined, scarred; it is fretted with many colours, cut and torn into all manner of fantastic shapes by work of roots and rain, by centuries of storm and the chisel of the lightning.
<p/>Bedded here, with ivy on its front, the smile of evening for a crown, and the forest like a green sea breaking in foam of leaves around it, the Water Stone stood.
<p/>Night was already come upon its eaves and cornices; from its feet ascended musical thunder of Plym in a riot of rocks; and aloft, clashing, echoing and re-echoing from scarp and precipice, there rang the cheerful chiming music of unnumbered jackdaws, who made these crags their home.
<p/>Mark Baskerville, descending into the valley from Shaugh, beheld this scene with understanding.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had been well educated; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was sentimental; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) regarded wild Nature in a manner rare amid those born and bred upon her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) bosom.
<p/>Beauty did not find him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) indifferent; old legends gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) joy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) knew the folk-tales of the land and dwelt upon them still with pleasure--an instinct surviving from boyhood, and deliberately suffered to survive.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) loved the emotion of awe and cultivated it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) led a life from choice much secluded; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had walked hitherto blind, in so far as women were concerned; but now a woman had entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) life, and Nature shone glorified throughout by the experience.
<p/>Mark was in love with Cora Lintern; yet this prime fact did not lessen his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) regard for the earth and the old stories concerning it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) found the things that were good aforetime still good, but changed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) emotions were all sharpened and intensified.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) strength was stronger; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) weakness was weaker than of yore.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was never out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) thoughts; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made the sunlight warmer, the bird's song sweeter, the night more wonderful.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) woke and found himself brave enough to approach her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the deep, small hours of morning; but with dawn came fear, and with day his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) courage melted.
<p/>By night also he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) made rhymes that seemed beautiful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) and brought moisture to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) eyes; but when the sun came and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) stumbling periods, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) blushed at them and banished them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was friendly and not averse; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was clever, and had many friends among young men.
<p/>Nathan Baskerville rejoiced in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and often foretold a notable match for Cora.
<p/>What Mark could offer seemed very little to Mark himself.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) father, indeed, was reputed rich; but life at Hawk House revealed no sign of it.
<p/>They lived hard, and Humphrey Baskerville affected a frugality that would have been unusual in the homes of humbler people.
<p/>Humphrey had often told his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) son that he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) did not know how to spend money; and as for Mark, until the present, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) had shared his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) father's indifference and been well content.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) felt that Cora might be fond of money; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) was glad sometimes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) father spent so little; because, if all went well, there must surely come a time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) would be able to rejoice Cora with great riches.
<p/>The obstacle, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) felt to be himself.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) distrust of himself was morbid; the folk said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) was frightened of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) own voice, and only spoke through the tenor bell of St. Edward's.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) descended into the shadows of the valley and moved along the brink of Plym, seeking for certain young wood, ripe for cutting.
<p/>Presently Mark found what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) sought, but made no immediate effort to begin work.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) flung down a frail which contained a bill-hook and saw.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) sat upon a rock overhanging the river and buried himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) own thoughts.
<p/>A path wound beside the stream, and along it sauntered suddenly the maiden of this man's dream.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) looked fair enough and moved in deep apparent unconsciousness of any human presence.
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) ignorance was simulated.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) had seen young Baskerville pass over the hill; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) had known his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) destination, and by a detour she (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) had entered the valley from below.
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) started and exhibited astonishment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mark!
<p/>Whoever would have thought--!
<p/>What be you doing here all alone like this--and you not a fisherman?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fisherman</b></font>) stammered, and grew pale.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy meeting; and I might ask what brought you, Cora?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, just a silly fondness for the river and the trees and my own thoughts.
<p/>I like being about among the wild things, though I dare say you won't believe it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, I'll believe it--gladly too.
<p/>Don't I like being about among 'em better than anything else?
<p/>I'm very pleased to meet you, I'm sure.
<p/>There's no lovelier bit of the river than here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dewerstone do look fine to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>'em</b></font>) said, glancing up at the crags above them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It does, then.
<p/>The Water Stone I always call it, since I read in a book that that was what it meant.
<p/>'Tis the great stone by the water, you see.
<p/>Have you ever heard tell of the Black Hunter, Cora?
<p/>But perhaps you don't hold with such old wife's tales?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) put him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) ease and assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loved ancient fables and liked to go on believing them, despite her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) better knowledge.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just the same as me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) cried eagerly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The very thing I do.
<p/>How wonderful you should feel the same!
<p/>I know 'tis rubbish, yet I let it go sadly.
<p/>I'd believe in the pixies, if I could!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was the Black Hunter, if you don't mind telling me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll sit here a bit afore I go on, if it won't be to hinder you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Proud I am, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hunter</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And as for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hunter</b></font>), the Black Hunter, that's no more than another name for the Devil himself.
<p/>'Twas thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>)'d come here by night with his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) great, bellowing, red-eyed dogs, and go forth to hunt souls.
<p/>A coal-black horse he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) rode; but sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>)'d set out afoot, for 'tis well remembered how once in the deep snow, on a winter morn, human footprints, along with hoofmarks, were traced to the top of the hill, but not down again!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The devil flew away with somebody?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So the old story says.
<p/>But I like the thought of the little Heath Hounds better.
<p/>For they hunt and harry old Nick's self.
<p/>They are the spirits of the young children who die before they are baptised; and the legend hath it that they win to heaven soon or late by hunting the Prince of Darkness.
<p/>'Tis the children that we bury with maimed rites upon `Chrisomers' Hill' in the churchyard.
<p/>They put that poor woman who killed herself in the same place, because the old parson wouldn't read `sure and certain hope' over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>But Cora was not interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) conversation, though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pretended to be.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) endeavoured to turn speech into a more personal road.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you come here for?
<p/>I hadn't any idea you ever took walks alone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I take hundreds--terrible poor hand at neighbouring with people, I am--like my father.
<p/>But I'm here to work--getting handles for tools.
<p/>There's no wood for light tools like alder.
<p/>You know the old rhyme--  `When aller's leaf is so big as a penny, The stick will wear so tough as any.'
<p/>That's true enough, for I've proved it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Set to work and I'll watch you, if I may.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Proud, I'm sure.
<p/>And I'll see you home after.
<p/>But there's no haste.
<p/>I was thinking that bare, dark corner in the garden at Undershaugh might do very nice for ferns--if you'd care--?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The very thing!
<p/>How kind to think of it.
<p/>I love the garden and the flowers.
<p/>But none else cares about them.
<p/>D'you think you could get me one of they king ferns?
<p/>But I suppose that would be too much to ask.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll get you more than one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll try to plant 'em then, but I'm not very clever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>''`Like!''
<p/>I should love it.
<p/>But 'tis very good of you to bother about a stupid girl.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you say that.
<p/>Far, far from stupid.
<p/>Never was a cleverer girl, I'm sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head and talked about the ferns.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) became personal.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've always felt somehow with you; but I suppose it ban't maidenly to say such things--but I've always felt as you understood me, Mark.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And as for me, I've felt--God, He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knows what I've felt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man broke off, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew the thing that shared his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and now spoke of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And through you I've got to love tenor bell almost as much as you do.
<p/>Of a Sunday the day isn't complete till I've heard the beautiful note of your bell and thought of you at the rope.
<p/>I always somehow think of you when I hear that bell; and I think of the bell when I see you!
<p/>Ban't that strange?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'''Tis your wonderful quick mind, and you couldn't say anything to please me better.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to ask you about the bells.
<p/>I'm so ignorant; but I thought, if 'twasn't silly of me, I'd ask you about 'em.
<p/>I suppose they'm awful difficult to ring?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit.
<p/>Only wants steady practice.
<p/>The whole business is little understood, but 'tis simple enough.
<p/>I've gone into it all from the beginning, and I'm glad--very glad--you care about it.
<p/>The first thing is for a ring of bells to be in harmony with itself, and founders ought to be free to make 'em so.
<p/>The bells are never better than when they are broken out of the moulds, and every touch of the lathe, or chip of the chisel, is music lost.
<p/>The thickness of the sound-bow should be one-thirteenth of the diameter, you must know; but modern bells are made for cheapness.
<p/>Long in the waist and high in the shoulder they should be for true fineness of sound; but they cast 'em with short waists and flat shoulders now.
<p/>'Tis easier to hang and ring them so; but they don't give the same music.
<p/>My tenor is a wonderful good bell--a maiden bell, as we say--one cast true, that has never had a chip at the sound-bow.
<p/>'I call the quick to church and dead to grave,' is her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) motto.
<p/>A Pennington bell she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) is, and no bell-founder ever cast a better.
<p/>Every year makes her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) sweeter, for there's nothing improves bell-metal like time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it wouldn't be possible for me actually to see the bells?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It can be done and shall be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pennington</b></font>) promised.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pennington</b></font>) went off again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been in nearly every bell-cot and bell-turret in Devonshire, one time and another, and I've took a hand in change-ringing far and wide; but our ring of six, for its size and weight, can't be beat in the county, and there's no sweeter tenor that I've heard than mine.
<p/>And I'm very hopeful that Mr. Masterman will take my advice and have our wheels and gear looked to, and the bell-chamber cleaned out.
<p/>'Tis the home of birds, and the nest litter lies feet deep up there.
<p/>The ladder's all rotten too.
<p/>We ought to have stays and slides; and our ropes are a bit too heavy, and lack tuftings for the sally.
<p/>I'm hopeful he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>)'ll have a care for these things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) prattled on, for it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) subject and always loosed his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) tongue.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was bored to death, but from time to time, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) feared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) wearied her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) interest did not wane and was only less than his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) own.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) showed unusual excitement at this meeting, was lifted out of himself, and talked until grey gloaming sank over the valley and the jackdaws were silent.
<p/>Then Cora started up and declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must return home quickly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listening to you has made me forget all about the time and everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll wonder whatever has befallen me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll see you home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) answered.
<p/>'''Tis my fault you'll be late, and I must take the blame.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I've kept you from your work, I'm afraid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's no matter at all.
<p/>To-morrow will do just as well for the alder.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) rose and walked beside her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) to help her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at one place in the wood, and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cool, firm hand thrilled him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>).
<p/>Once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) thought to take this noble opportunity and utter the thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) heart; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) could not bring himself to do it.
<p/>Then, at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and they exchanged many assurances of mutual thanks and obligation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) promised to bring the ferns in three days' time, and undertook to spend an evening with the Linterns, build the rockery, and stay to supper with the family afterwards.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) walked home treading on air, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) mind full of hope and happiness.
<p/>Cora had never been so close as on this day; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had never vouchsafed such an intimate glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) beautiful spirit before.
<p/>Each word, each look seemed to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) nearer; and yet, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) reflected on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) own imperfections, a wave of doubt swept coldly over him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) supped in silence, but, after the meal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) confessed the thoughts in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) mind.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never broke a twig this evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was just going to begin, when who should come along but Cora Lintern.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) forgiven parson for turning her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) out of the choir?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not with a face like hers?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're wrong there.
<p/>I'll swear it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s very different to what you reckon.
<p/>Why, this very evening, there she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was under the Water Stone all alone--walking along by herself just for love of the place.
<p/>Often goes there, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tells me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very surprised to find you there--eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was.

 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Baskerville smoked and looked into the fire.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went out and left his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father alone.
<p/>Elsewhere Phyllis Lintern had eagerly inquired of Cora as to the interview with the bellringer.
<p/>The girls shared many secrets and were close friends.
<p/>They knew unconsciously that their brother was more to the mother than were they.
<p/>Heathman adored Mrs. Lintern and never wearied of showing it; but for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sisters he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cared little, and they felt no interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
<p/>Now Phyllis sympathised with Cora's ambitions and romances.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How was it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I warrant you brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) to the scratch!''

<p/>The word was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) tongue coming up-along in the dimpsy; but it stuck in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) throat.
<p/>I know the signs well enough.
<p/>However, `twill slip out pretty soon, I reckon.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>)'s a good sort, though fidgety, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>)'s gotten lovely eyes.
<p/>I'll wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) up and smarten him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) up, too--presently.''
<p/>CHAPTER VII  When man builds a house on Dartmoor, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plants trees to protect it.
<p/>Sometimes they perish; sometimes they endure to shield his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dwelling from the riotous and seldom-sleeping winds.
<p/>Round the abode of Humphrey Baskerville stood beech and pine.
<p/>A solid old house lurked beneath, like a bear in its grove.
<p/>People likened its face to the master's--the grey, worn, tar-pitched roof to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hair, and the small windows on either side of the door to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>A few apple trees were in the garden, and currant and gooseberry bushes prospered indifferent well beneath them.
<p/>Rhubarb and a row of elders also flourished here.
<p/>The latter were permitted to exist for their fruit, and of the berries Mrs. Susan Hacker, Humphrey's widowed housekeeper, made medicinal preparations supposed to possess value.
<p/>Hawk House lay under a tor, and behind it the land towered to a stony waste that culminated in wild masses of piled granite, where the rowan grew and the vixen laid her (<font color='blue'><b>vixen</b></font>) cubs.
<p/>From this spot one might take a bird's-eye survey of Humphrey Baskerville's domain.
<p/>Gold lichens had fastened on the roof, and the folk conceited that since there was no more room in the old man's house for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money, it began to ooze out through the tiles.
<p/>Humphrey himself now sat on a favourite stone aloft and surveyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) possessions and the scene around them.
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) custom in fair weather to spend many hours sequestered upon the tor.
<p/>Dwarf oaks grew in the clitters, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) marked the passage of the time by their activity, by the coming of migrant birds, by the appearance of the infant foxes and by other natural signs and tokens.
<p/>Beneath Hawk House there subtended a great furze-clad space flanked with woods.
<p/>The Rut, as it was called, fell away to farms and fertile fields, and terminated in a glen through which the little Torry river passed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) way to Plym.
<p/>Cann Wood fringed the neighbouring heights, and far away to the south Laira's lake extended and Plymouth appeared--faint, grey, glittering under a gauze of smoke.
<p/>The tor itself was loved by hawks and stoats, crows and foxes.
<p/>Not a few people, familiar with the fact that Humphrey here took his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) solitary walks and kept long vigils, would affirm that he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) held a sort of converse with these predatory things and learned from them their winged and four-footed cunning.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) sympathy, indeed, was with fox and hawk rather than with hunter and hound.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) admitted it, but in no sense of companionship with craft did he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) interest himself in the wild creatures.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) made no fatuous imputation of cruelty to the hawk, or cunning to the fox.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) bent of mind, none the less, inclined him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) to admire their singlehanded fight for life against long odds; and thus he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>), too, fell into fallacy; but his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) opinion took a practical turn and was not swiftly shattered, as such emotions are apt to be, when the pitied outlaw offers to the sentimental spectator a personal taste of his (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) quality.
<p/>If a hawk stooped above his (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) chickens, he (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) felt a sort of contempt for the screaming, flying fowls--let the hawk help itself if it could--and did not run for his (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) gun.
<p/>Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) had no gun.
<p/>As men said of this or that obstinate ancient that he (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) had never travelled in a train, so they affirmed, concerning Humphrey Baskerville, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had never in his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) life fired a gun.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) sat and smoked a wooden pipe and reflected on the puzzles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) days.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was held in little esteem, but that had never troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) inquiring spirit rose above his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) fellow-creatures; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) prided himself upon the fact, and did not see that just in this particular of a flight too lofty did he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) fail of the landmarks and sure ground he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) sought.
<p/>A discontent, in substance very distinguished and noble, imbued his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) consciousness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was still seeking solace out of life and a way that should lead to rest.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) could not find it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was in arms on the wrong road.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) missed the fundamental fact that from humanity and service arise not only the first duties of life, but also the highest rewards that life can offer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had little desire towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) fellow-creatures.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) mind appeared to magnify their deficiencies and weakness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was ungenerous in his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) interpretation of motives.
<p/>Mankind awoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) highest impatience.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) sneered at his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) own shortcomings daily, and had no more mercy for the manifold disabilities of human nature in general.
<p/>In the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) religion and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) learning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) conceived that man should be by many degrees a nobler and a wiser thing than he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>); and this conclusion awoke impatience and a fiery aversion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) groped therefore in a blind alley, for as yet service of man had not brought its revelation to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spirit, or opened the portals of content.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) failed to perceive that the man who lives rationally for men, with all thereby involved in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty to himself, is justifying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own existence to the limit of human capacity.
<p/>Instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fulfilled obligations to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) particular God with all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might, and supposed this rule of conduct embraced every necessity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) despised his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbour, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) despised himself also.
<p/>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was logical, but such a rule of conduct left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lonely.
<p/>Hence it came about that darkness clothed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like a garment, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kind shunned him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and cared not to consider him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat silent and motionless.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gift of stillness had often won some little intimate glimpse of Nature, and it did so now.
<p/>A fox went by him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) at close quarters.
<p/>It passed absorbed in its own affairs, incautious and without fear.
<p/>Then suddenly it saw him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>), braced its muscles and slipped away like a streak of cinnamon light through the stones.
<p/>It made for the dwarf oaks beneath the head of the tor, and the watcher saw its red stern rise and its white-tipped brush jerk this way and that as it leapt from boulder to boulder.
<p/>A big and powerful fox--so Humphrey perceived; one that had doubtless stood before hounds in his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) time, and would again.
<p/>Arrived at the confines of the wood, the brute hurried himself no more; but rested awhile and, with a sort of highwayman insolence, surveyed the object of alarm.
<p/>Then it disappeared, and the man smiled to himself and was glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen this particular neighbour.
<p/>At the poultry-house far below, moved Mrs. Hacker.
<p/>Viewed from this elevation she (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) presented nothing but a sun-bonnet and a great white square of apron.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) wore black, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) bust disappeared seen thus far away, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) capacious person might be noted at a mile.
<p/>Susan Hacker was florid, taciturn, and staunch to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) master.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) had a hero, it was Mr. Baskerville; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) had an antipathy, Miss Eliza Gollop stood for that repugnance.
<p/>Of Susan it might be said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was honest and not honest.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) case, though, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) would have scorned to take a crust; she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) listened at doors.
<p/>To steal a spoon was beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) power; but to steal information not intended for her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) ears did not outrage her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) moral sense.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) rare triumphs were concerned with Humphrey's ragged wardrobe; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) could prevail with him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) to buy a new suit of clothes, or burn an old one, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) felt the day had justified itself.
<p/>Now, through the clitters beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>), there ascended a man, and Humphrey prepared to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) nephew.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) had marked Rupert speak with Mrs. Hacker and seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) point to the tor.
<p/>It pleased the uncle that this youth should sometimes call unasked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) rated Rupert as the sanest and usefulest of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) kindred.
<p/>In a sense Rupert pleased Humphrey better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) own son did.
<p/>A vague instinct to poetry and sentiment and things of abstract beauty, which belonged as an ingredient to Mark's character, found no echo in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) father's breast.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I be come to eat my dinner along with you and fetch a message for Mark,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>began the young man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Masterman's meeting, to tell everybody about the play, will be held in the parish room early next month, and parson specially wants you and Mark to be there.
<p/>There's an idea of reviving some old-fangled customs.
<p/>I dare say 'tis a very good idea, and there will be plenty to lend a hand; but I doubt whether Mark will dress up and spout poetry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>)--any more than I would.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) means to perform `St.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, one man's meat is another man's poison.

<p/>You and me might say, `don't wake 'em up'; but 'tisn't our business.
<p/>It is his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) business, as a minister, to open their eyes and polish their senses.
<p/>So let him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) try with childish things first--not that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'ll succeed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) won't.''

<p/>But Head will be thinking.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) laughed at me for one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rupert/Rupert Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Rupert; <div class="bookquote">``and though I laughed back, I smarted under his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) tongue.

 (<font color='red'><b>Rupert/Rupert Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Baskerville scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) head with the mouthpiece of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) pipe, and surveyed Rupert for some time without speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll walk a bit and I'll show you something,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said.

 (<font color='red'><b>Hawk</b></font>)</div><p/>They stood on Hawk Tor, and beneath them stretched, first, the carpet of the heath.
<p/>Then the ground fell into a valley, where water meadows spread about a stream, and beyond, by woods and homesteads, the earth ascended again to Shaugh Prior.
<p/>The village, perched upon the apex of the hill, twinkled like a jewel.
<p/>Glitter of whitewash and rosy-wash shone under the grey roofs; sunlight and foliage sparkled and intermingled round the church tower; light roamed upon the hills, revealing and obscuring detail in its passage.
<p/>To the far west, above deep valleys, the world appeared again; but now it had receded and faded and merged in tender blue to the horizon.
<p/>Earth spread before the men in three huge and simple planes: of heath and stone sloping from north to south; of hillside and village and hamlet perched upon their proper crest; of the dim, dreaming distance swept with the haze of summer and rising to sky-line.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not small--that's big,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey Baskerville.

<p/>And every man and woman of the lot lived and died, and suffered and sweated, and did good or evil within this picture-frame.''

<p/>To take such a woman is the best day's work that even the hardest working man can do in this world.
<p/>But meantime don't whine, but go ahead and gather wisdom and learn a little about the things that happen outside the picture-frame--as I do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They turned presently and went back to dinner.
<p/>Rupert praised his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) uncle, and declared that life looked the easier for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) advice.
<p/>'''Tis no good being called `The Hawk' if you can't sharpen your wits as well as your claws,'' said the old man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--you're astonished--but I know what they call me well enough.''

<p/>I can't see the way very clear yet.
<p/>Let me know if ever you come by it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You!
<p/>Why, you'm the most contented of any of us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and eat, and don't talk of what you know nought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Baskerville.
<p/>They went through the back yard of the homestead presently, where a hot, distinctive odour of pigs saturated the air.
<p/>As they passed by, some young, very dirty, pink porkers grunted with fat, amiable voices and cuddled to their lean mother, where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lay in a lair of ordure.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's content,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>explained Humphrey; <div class="bookquote">``it belongs to brainless things, and only to them.
<p/>I haven't found it among men and women yet, and I never count to.
<p/>Rainbow gold in this world.
<p/>Yet, don't mistake me, I'm seeking after it still.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why seek for it, if there's no such thing, uncle?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well may you ask that.
<p/>But the answer's easy.
<p/>Because 'tis part of my character to seek for it, Rupert.
<p/>Character be stronger than reason's self, if you can understand that.
<p/>I seek because I'm driven.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might find it after all, uncle.
<p/>There must be such a thing--else there'd be no word for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The older sighed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A young and hopeful fashion of thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you're out there.
<p/>Men have made up words for many a fine, fancied thing their hearts long for; but the word is all--stillborn out of poor human hope.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) brooded deep into his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) own soul upon this thought and spoke little more that day.
<p/>But Mark was waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) dinner when they returned, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) and Rupert found themes in common to occupy them through the meal.
<p/>The great project of the new vicar chiefly supplied conversation.
<p/>Rupert felt indifferent, but Mark was much interested.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very willing to lend a hand all I can, and I expect the parish will support it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But as for play-acting myself, and taking a part, I wouldn't for all the world.
<p/>It beats me how anybody can get up on a platform and speak a speech afore his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) fellow-creatures assembled.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The girls will like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rupert/Rupert Baskerville</b></font>)</div>foretold Rupert.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cora Lintern is to play a part,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mark/Mark Baskerville</b></font>)</div>declared Mark; <div class="bookquote">``and no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll do it amazing well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mark/Mark Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Rupert was up in arms at once.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think they'll ask Milly Luscombe too.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>)'s got more wits than any of 'em.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) may have as much as Cora, but not more, I can assure you of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mark/Mark Baskerville</b></font>)</div>answered Mark firmly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) rarely contradicted a statement or opposed an assertion; but upon this great subject his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) courage was colossal.
<p/>CHAPTER VIII  Mr. Masterman and his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) sister made more friends than enemies.
<p/>The man's good-nature and energy attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) parishioners; while Miss Masterman, though not genial, was sincere.
<p/>A certain number followed the party of Mr. Gollop and Eliza, yet, as time passed, it diminished.
<p/>The surplices arrived; the girls were turned out of the choir; but the heavens did not fall.
<p/>Even the Nonconformists of Shaugh Prior regarded the young vicar with friendliness, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) called a meeting at the parish room, Mr. Nathan Baskerville and others who stood for dissent, attended it in an amiable spirit.
<p/>Rumours as to the nature of the proposition had leaked out, and they were vague; but a very general interest had been excited, and when the evening came the vicar, his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) churchwardens, and friends, found a considerable company assembled.
<p/>There were present Vivian and Nathan Baskerville, with most of the former's family.
<p/>Mrs. Lintern and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) two daughters from Undershaugh also came; while Heathman Lintern, Ned Baskerville, and other young men stood in a group at the rear of the company.
<p/>From Trowlesworthy arrived the warrener, Saul Luscombe, his (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) niece, Milly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) man, Jack Head.
<p/>People looked uneasy at sight of the last, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) was a revolutionary and firebrand.
<p/>The folk suspected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) held socialistic views, and were certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) worked harm on the morals of younger people.
<p/>Susan Hacker, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) master's wish, attended the meeting and sat impassive among friends.
<p/>Thomas Gollop and Joe Voysey, the vicarage gardener, sat together; but Miss Gollop was not present, because her (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) services were occupied with the newly-born.
<p/>A buzz and babel filled the chamber and the heat increased.
<p/>Jack Head opened a window.
<p/>Whereupon Mr. Gollop rose and shut it again.
<p/>The action typified that eternal battle of principle which waged between them.
<p/>But Vivian Baskerville was on the side of fresh air.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let be!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) shouted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Us don't want to be roasted alive, Thomas!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So the window was opened once more, and Head triumphed.
<p/>Dennis Masterman swiftly explained his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) desire and invited the parish to support him (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) in reviving an ancient and obsolete ceremonial.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The oldest men among you must remember the days of the Christmas mummers,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've heard all about them from eye-witnesses, and it strikes me that to get up the famous play of `St.
<p/>George,' with the quaint old-world dialogue, would give us all something to do this winter, and be very interesting and instructive, and capital fun.
<p/>There are plenty among you who could act the parts splendidly, and as the original version is rather short and barren, I should have some choruses written in, and go through it and polish it up, and perhaps even add a character or two.
<p/>In the old days it was all done by the lads, but why not have some lasses in it as well?
<p/>However, these are minor points to be decided later.
<p/>Would you like the play?
<p/>that's the first question.
<p/>It is a revival of an ancient custom.
<p/>It will interest a great many people outside our parish; and if it is to be done at all, it must be done really well.
<p/>Probably some will be for it and some against.
<p/>For my part, I only want to please the greater number.
<p/>Those who are for it had better elect a spokesman, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>spokesman</b></font>) say a word first; then we'll hear those who are against.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The people</b></font>)</div><p/>The people listened quietly; then they bent this way and that, and discussed the suggestion.
<p/>Some rose and approached Vivian Baskerville, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) sat beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) brother.
<p/>After some minutes of buzzing conversation, during which Vivian shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) head vigorously, and Nathan as vigorously nodded, the latter rose with reluctance, and the folk stamped their feet.
<p/>'''Tis only because of my brother's modest nature that I get up,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) explained.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``As a Church of England man and a leader among us, they very properly wanted for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to speak.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) won't do it, and no more will young Farmer Waite, and no more will Mr. Luscombe of Trowlesworthy; so I'll voice 'em to the best of my power.
<p/>Though I'm of t`other branch of the Christian Church, yet my friends will bear me out that I've nothing but kind feeling and regard for all of them, and in such a pleasant matter as this I shall do all in my power to help your reverence, as we all shall.
<p/>For I do think there's none but will make the mummers welcome again, and lend a hand to lift the fun into a great success.
<p/>Me and my brother and Luscombe, and Waite and Gollop, and Joe Voysey, and a good few more, can well remember the old mumming days; and we'll all do our best to rub up our memories.
<p/>So what we all say is, `Go ahead, Mr. Masterman, and good luck to it!'''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>Applause greeted Nathan.
<p/>The folk were filled with admiration at his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) ready turn of speech.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) sat down again between Mrs. Lintern and Cora.
<p/>Everybody clapped their hands.
<p/>Then came a hiss from the corner where Jack Head stood.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A dissentient voice,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>declared the clergyman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is Jack Head, and I be gwaine to offer objections,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man stoutly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better save your wind then!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gollop/Gollop</b></font>)</div><p/>snapped Mr. Gollop.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You be one against the meeting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>individual</b></font>)</div><p/>Head was a middle-aged, narrow-browed, and underhung individual of an iron-grey colour.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) body was long and thin; his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) shoulders were high; his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) expression aggressive, yet humorous.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) had swift wits and a narrow understanding.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) was observant and impressed with the misery of the world; but he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) possessed no philosophical formulas to balance his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) observation or counsel patience before the welter of life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) was honest, but scarce knew the meaning of amenity.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One or not won't shut my mouth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm a member of the parish so much as you, though I don't bleat a lot of wild nonsense come every seventh day, and I say that to spend good time and waste good money this way be a disgrace, and a going back instead of going forward.
<p/>What for do we want to stir up a lot of silly dead foolishness that our grandfathers invented?
<p/>Ban't there nothing better to do with ourselves and our wits than dress up like a ship-load of monkeys and go play-acting?
<p/>We might so well start to wassail the apple-trees and put mourning on the bee-butts when a man dies.
<p/>I'm against it, and I propose instead that Mr. Masterman looks round him (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) and sees what a miserable Jakes of a mess his (<font color='blue'><b>Jakes</b></font>) parish be in, and spends his (<font color='blue'><b>Jakes</b></font>) time trying to get the landlords to--''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Order!

<p/>Where's Ben North?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm here, Thomas,''  (<font color='red'><b>a policeman</b></font>)</div>said a policeman, who stood at the door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'm a silly old mumphead,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div>replied Jack.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To hear you about this parish--God's truth!
<p/>I'll tell you this, my brave hero.
<p/>When the devil was showing the Lord the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of 'em, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) thumb on Shaugh Prior, so as none should see what a dung-heap of a place it was.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Order!
<p/>Order!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Masterman/Masterman</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Miss Masterman shrilly, and Mr. Gollop grew livid.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I appeal to the chair!
<p/>I appeal to the nation!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) gasped.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) fist at Jack.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no chair--not yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div>explained Dennis.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``As soon as we decide, I'll take the chair, and we'll appoint a committee to go into the matter and arrange the parts, and so on.
<p/>The first thing is, are we agreed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>One loud shout attested to the sense of the meeting.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Mr. Head, you're in a minority of one, and I hope we may yet convince you that this innocent revival is not a bad thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div>said Dennis.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And further than that, you mustn't run down Shaugh Prior in this company.
<p/>We've got a cheerful conceit of ourselves, and why not?
<p/>Don't think I'm dead to the dark side of human life, and the sorrows and sufferings of the poor.
<p/>I hope you'll all very soon find that I'm not that sort, or my sister either.
<p/>And the devil himself can't hide Shaugh Prior from the Lord and Saviour of us all, Mr. Head--have no fear of that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, Jack, and say you'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Luscombe</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Luscombe.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've stated my views at a free meeting, and I'm on the losing side, like men of my opinions always be where parsons have a voice.
<p/>But me and my friends will be up top presently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gollop/Gollop</b></font>)</div><p/>shouted Mr. Gollop; but Ben North refused.
<p/>Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>North</b></font>) was of Jack's party.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>North</b></font>)'ve done nought but say his (<font color='blue'><b>North</b></font>) say, and I shan't turn him (<font color='blue'><b>North</b></font>) out,''  (<font color='red'><b>the policeman</b></font>)</div>the policeman answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nobody in the chair yet, and therefore there's none here with power to command the Law to move.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A committee was swiftly formed.
<p/>It consisted of the clergyman and certain parishioners.
<p/>Nathan joined it for his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) family; Mr. Luscombe also joined, and Dennis promised that certain local antiquaries and the lord of the manor would assist the enterprise.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``While we are here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dennis</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``we may as well get the thing well advanced and decide about the characters.
<p/>All those interested are here, so why not let me read through the old play as it stands?
<p/>Then we'll settle the parts, and each can copy his (<font color='blue'><b>Dennis</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) part in turn.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing like being fore-handed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>admitted Nathan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's have it by all means.
<p/>We shall want young and old to play, if my memory serves me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall, and a good company to sing the songs that I hope to add.
<p/>My sister, our organist, will undertake the music.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And right well she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'ll do it, without a doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>declared Nathan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``On all hands 'tis admitted how the church music has mended a lot since she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) took it up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Masterman/Masterman</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Masterman then read a version of the old play, and its ingenuous humour woke laughter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>said the vicar when his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) recital was at an end, <div class="bookquote">``I'll ask those among us who will volunteer to act--ladies and gentlemen--to come forward.

 (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only to look nice, and I'm sure that won't cost 'em an effort, for they can't help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>declared Nathan.
<p/>None immediately rose.
<p/>Then Ned Baskerville strolled down the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Best-looking young man in Shaugh,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried an anonymous voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the laziest!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>answered another unknown.
<p/>There was a laugh and Ned turned ruddy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou`lt never take trouble enough to learn thy part, Ned!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Heathman Lintern.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Play Turkish knight, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then thou can`st be knocked on the head and die comfortable without more trouble.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Others</b></font>)</div><p/>Others followed Ned, and Mr. Masterman called for Mark.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll not desert us, Mark?
<p/>I shall want your help, I know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And glad to give it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the young man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grew very hot and nervous to find himself named.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice broke, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coughed and cut a poor figure.
<p/>Somebody patted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the back.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be frighted, Mark,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vivian/Vivian Baskerville/Mr. Vivian Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Vivian Baskerville; <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) reverence only wants for you to do what you can.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) wouldn't ask impossibilities.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vivian/Vivian Baskerville/Mr. Vivian Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Baskerville compared her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) handsome son to stammering Mark and felt satisfied.
<p/>Cora Lintern also contrasted the young men, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) bosom was anything but satisfaction.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't act, but you must help in many ways.
<p/>You're so well up in the old lore--all about our legends and customs,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>explained the clergyman.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gollop/Gollop</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Mr. Gollop.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me to play-act!

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must play, Thomas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vivian/Vivian Baskerville/Mr. Vivian Baskerville</b></font>)</div>urged Vivian Baskerville of Cadworthy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For that matter I've took the stage often enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vivian/Vivian Baskerville/Mr. Vivian Baskerville</b></font>)</div>admitted Vivian; <div class="bookquote">``but 'twas to work, not to talk.
<p/>All the same, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) reverence would like for me to play a part, why, I'm ready and willing, so long as there isn't much to say to it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vivian/Vivian Baskerville/Mr. Vivian Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hurrah for Mr.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) head, however, and answered under his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) breath.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter a button about his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) being a dissenter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Princess Sabra, the King of Egypt's daughter, will be a novelty, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sabra</b></font>) didn't come into the old play in person.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Lintern for Princess Sabra!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mark/Mark Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mark.
<p/>Everybody laughed, and the young man came in for some chaff; but Dennis approved, and Mrs. Lintern nodded and smiled.
<p/>Cora blushed and Nathan patted Mark on the back.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A good idea, and we're all for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) said.
<p/>To Cora, as the belle of the village, belonged the part by right.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) was surprised and gratified at this sudden access of importance.
<p/>Then the vicar prepared to close his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) meeting.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For Mother Dorothy we want a lady of mature years and experience.

 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Nathan's heart sank, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) could not object.
<p/>The company was divided.
<p/>Then, to the surprise of not a few, Mrs. Hacker spoke again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll do it, and chance master,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And very fine you'll look.
<p/>You've got to kiss Father Christmas at the end of the play, though.
<p/>I hope you don't mind that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's why she (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>)'s going to act the part!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>shouted Heathman, and laughter drowned Mrs. Hacker's reply.
<p/>In good spirits the company broke up, and the young folk went away excited, the old people interested and amused.
<p/>Merriment sounded on the grey July night; many women chattered about the play till long after their usual hour for sleep; and plenty of coarse jests as to the promised entertainment were uttered at the bar of `The White Thorn' presently.
<p/>As for the vicar and his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) sister, they felt that they had achieved a triumph.
<p/>Two shadows alone darkened the outlook in Miss Masterman's eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) objected to the Nonconformist element as undesirable or unnecessary; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) did not like the introduction of Queen Sabra.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That showy girl is quite conceited enough already,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said.
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brother was young and warm-hearted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s lovely, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``By Jove!
<p/>the play will be worth doing, if only to see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) got up like a princess!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be silly, Dennis,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Dennis</b></font>) sister.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s a rude wretch, and the Linterns are the most independent people in the parish.''
 (<font color='red'><b>men maids</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IX  At high summer two men and two maids kept public holiday and wove romance under the great crown of Pen Beacon.
<p/>From this border height the South Hams spread in a mighty vision of rounded hills and plains; whole forests were reduced to squat, green cushions laid upon the broad earth's bosom; and amid them glimmered wedges and squares of ripening corn, shone root crops, smiled water meadows, and spread the emerald faces of shorn hayfields.
<p/>It was a day of lowering clouds and illumination breaking through them.
<p/>Fans of light fell between the piled-up cumuli, and the earth was mottled with immense, alternate patches of shadow and sunshine.
<p/>Thick and visible strata of air hung heavy between earth and sky at this early hour.
<p/>They presaged doubt, and comprehended a condition that might presently diffuse and lift into unclouded glory of August light, or darken to thunderstorm.
<p/>Southerly the nakedness of Hanger Down and the crags of Eastern and Western Beacons towered; while to the east were Quickbeam Hill, Three Barrows, and the featureless expanses of Stall Moor.
<p/>Northerly towered Penshiel, and the waste spread beyond it in long leagues, whose planes were flattened out by distance and distinguished against each other by sleeping darkness and waking light.
<p/>A fuliginous heaviness, that stained air at earth's surface, persisted even on this lofty ground, and the highest passages of aerial radiance were not about the sun, but far beneath it upon the horizon.
<p/>Rupert Baskerville trudged doubtfully forward, sniffing the air and watching the sky, while beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) came Milly Luscombe; and a quarter of a mile behind them walked Mark and Cora Lintern.
<p/>The men had arranged to spend their holiday up aloft, and Milly was well pleased; but Cora held the expedition vain save for what it should accomplish.
<p/>To dawdle in the Moor when she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) might have been at a holiday revel was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) idea of pleasure; but as soon as Mark issued his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) invitation she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) guessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) did so with an object, and promised to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>).
<p/>As yet the definite word had not passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) lips, though it had hovered there; but to-day Miss Lintern was resolved to return from Pen Beacon betrothed.
<p/>As for Mark, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) hope chimed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) intention.
<p/>Cora was always gracious and free of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) time, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) played the devout lover and sincerely held her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) above him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) every way.
<p/>Only the week before Heathman, obviously inspired to do so, had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) kept off, and declared that it would better become him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) to speak.
<p/>And now, feeling that the meal presently to be taken would be of a more joyous character after than before the deed, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) stopped Cora while yet a mile remained to trudge before they should reach the top of the tor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rest a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let Rupert and Milly go forward.
<p/>They don't want us, and we shall all meet in the old roundy-poundies up over, where we're going to eat our dinner.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Looks as if 'twas offering for bad weather,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) answered, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) eyes to the sky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad I didn't put on my new muslin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) sat on a stone and felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was now going to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) was not enthusiastic about him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) at the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) heart; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) would be rich and a good match for a girl in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) position.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was prone to exaggerate her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beauty, and had hoped better things from it than Mark Baskerville; but certain minor romances with more important men had come to nothing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was practical and made herself see the bright side of the contract.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was humble and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could influence him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pleased.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) worshipped her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and would doubtless continue to do so.
<p/>Once his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) wife she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) proposed to waken in him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) a better conceit of himself and, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) father died, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would be able to `blossom out,' as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) put it to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sister, and hold her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head high in the land.
<p/>There were prospects.
<p/>Nathan Baskerville was rich also, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was childless.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) liked Mark well, and on one occasion, when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came into the farm kitchen at Undershaugh suddenly, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) overheard Nathan say to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``No objection--none at all--a capital match for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Mark put down the basket that carried their meal and took a seat beside Cora.
<p/>'''Tisn't going to rain,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always know by my head if there's thunder in the elements.
<p/>It gets a sort of heavy, aching feeling.
<p/>Look yonder, the clouds are levelling off above the Moor so true as if they'd been planed.
<p/>That's the wind's work.
<p/>Why, there's enough blue showing to make you a new dress a`ready, Cora.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd love a dress of such blue as that.
<p/>Blue's my colour,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is--though you look lovely enough in any colour.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like to please you, Mark.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cora, and don't you please me?
<p/>Little you know--little you know.
<p/>I've had it on my tongue a thousand times--yet it seems too bold--from such as me to you.
<p/>Why, there's none you mightn't look to; and if you'd come of a higher havage, you'd have been among the loveliest ladies in the land.
<p/>And so you are now, for that matter--only you're hid away in this savage old place--like a beautiful pearl under the wild sea.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>This had long been Cora's own opinion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) smiled and touched the hair on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hot forehead.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If there comes on a fog, I shall go out of curl in a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said.
<p/>Then, seeing that this prophecy silenced him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) spoke again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I love to hear you tell these kind things, Mark.
<p/>I'd sooner please you than any man living.
<p/>Perhaps 'tis over-bold in me to say so; but I'm telling nought but truth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Truth ban't often so beautiful as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) said slowly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And 'tis like your brave heart to say it out; and here's truth for your truth, Cora.
<p/>If you care to hear me say I think well of you, then I care to hear you speak well of me; and more: nobody else's good word is better than wind in the trees against your slightest whisper.
<p/>So that I please you, I care nothing for all the world; and if you'll let me, I'll live for you and die for you.
<p/>For that matter I've lived for only you these many days, and if you'll marry me--there--'tis out.
<p/>I'm a vain chap even to dare to say it; but 'tis you have made me so--'tis your kind words and thoughts for me--little thoughts that peep out and dear little kind things done by you and forgotten by you; but never by me, Cora.
<p/>Can you do it?
<p/>Can you sink down to me, or is it too much of a drop?
<p/>Others have lowered themselves for love and never regretted it.
<p/>'Tis a fall for such a bright, lovely star as you; but my love's ready to catch you, so you shan't hurt yourself.
<p/>I--I--''   (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) broke off and she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) seemed really moved.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) two, which were knotted together; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) looked love into his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) straining eyes and nodded.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) hands opened and seized hers and squeezed them till she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) drew in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) breath.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't move, for God's sake!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``D'you know what you've done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Given myself to a dear good chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) answered.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was thanking heaven that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had not worn the new muslin dress.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Weather or no weather, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'d have creased it and mangled it all over and ruined it for ever,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) thought.
<p/>They proceeded presently, but made no haste to overtake their companions.
<p/>Their talk was of the future and marriage.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) pressed for an early union; she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was in no hurry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must learn a bit more about me first,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe I'm not half as nice as you think.
<p/>And there's your father.
<p/>I'm terrible frightened of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not be, Cora.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>)'ll be right glad for my sake, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>)'ll be sure to tell me I've had better luck than I deserve.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) considered awhile without speaking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I shan't bring you much money,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's money?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will your father do?
<p/>Then there's your uncle, Mr. Nathan.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be all right.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me just one more lovely kiss, before we get over the hill-top and come in sight of them.
<p/>We're to meet at the `old men's' camp.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>anybody</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and then silence fell between them.
<p/>It lasted a long while until he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) broke it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't fancy because I'm so still that I'm not bursting with joy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But when I think of what's happened to me this minute, I feel 'tis too big for words.
<p/>The thoughts in me can't be spoken, Cora.
<p/>They are too large to cram into little pitiful speeches.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm getting hungry; and there's Milly waving,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Milly's hungry too, belike.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pen Beacon</b></font>)</div><p/>Eastward, under Pen Beacon, lay an ancient lodge of the neolithic people.
<p/>The circles of scattered granite shone grey, set in foliage and fruit of the bilberry, with lichens on the stone and mosses woven into the grass about them.
<p/>A semicircle of hills extended beyond and formed a mighty theatre where dawn and storm played their parts, where falling night was pictured largely and moonshine slept upon lonely heights and valleys.
<p/>In the glen beneath spread Dendles Wood, with fringes of larch and pine hiding the River Yealm and spreading a verdant medley of deep summer green in the lap of the grey hills.
<p/>Gold autumn furzes flashed along the waste, and the pink ling broke into her (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) first tremble of colourless light that precedes the blush of fulness.
<p/>The party of four sat in a hut circle and spoke little while they ate and drank.
<p/>Rupert, unknown to the rest, and much to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) own inconvenience, had dragged up six stone bottles of ginger-beer hidden under his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) coat.
<p/>These he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) produced and was much applauded.
<p/>A spring broke at hand, and the bottles were sunk therein to cool them.
<p/>They talked together after a very practical and businesslike fashion.
<p/>Milly and Rupert were definitely engaged in their own opinion, and now when Mark, who could not keep in the stupendous event of the moment, announced it, they congratulated the newly engaged couple with the wisdom and experience of those who had long entered that state.
<p/>'''Tis a devilish unrestful condition, I can promise you,'' said Rupert, <div class="bookquote">``and the man always finds it so if the girl don't.
<p/>Hanging on is just hell--especially in my case, where I can't get father to see with my eyes.
<p/>But, thank God, Milly's jonic.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) won't change.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rupert/Rupert Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Milly/Milly Luscombe/Luscombe</b></font>)</div>said Milly, <div class="bookquote">``I shan't change.
<p/>'Tis you have got to change.
<p/>I respect your father very much, like the rest of the world, but because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) didn't marry till he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was turned forty-five, that's no reason why you should wait twenty years for it.
<p/>Anyway, if you must, so will I--only I shall be a thought elderly for the business by that time.
<p/>However, it rests with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Milly/Milly Luscombe/Luscombe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going--that's what she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rupert/Rupert Baskerville</b></font>)</div>explained Rupert.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jack Head and me have had a talk, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>)'s thrown a lot of light on things in general.
<p/>I can't be bound hand and foot to my father like this; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) won't meet me, I must take things into my own hands and leave home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mark/Mark Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Mark was staggered at the enormity of such a plan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't do anything in a hurry and without due thought.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well for you to talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Milly/Milly Luscombe/Luscombe</b></font>)</div>said Milly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do nought but ring the bells on Sundays, and play at work the rest of the week.
<p/>Mr. Humphrey won't stand in your way.
<p/>I suppose you could be married afore Christmas, if you pleased.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) sighed at the glorious possibility.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope we shall be; but Cora's in no hurry, I'm afraid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And when I've got work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rupert/Rupert Baskerville</b></font>)</div>continued Rupert, <div class="bookquote">``then I shall just look round and take a house and marry; and why not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rupert/Rupert Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father will never let you go.
<p/>It isn't to be thought upon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mark/Mark Baskerville</b></font>)</div>declared Mark.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) must be reasonable.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) appears to forget I'm nearly twenty-four,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) cousin.
<p/>Conversation ranged over their problems and their hopes.
<p/>Then Rupert touched another matrimonial disappointment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks as if we were not to be fortunate in love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's Ned terrible down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) luck.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>)'s offered marriage again--to Farmer Chave's second daughter; and 'twas as good as done; but Mr. Chave wouldn't hear of it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chave</b></font>)'s talked the girl round and Ned's got chucked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Chaves are a lot too high for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mark/Mark Baskerville</b></font>)</div>asserted Mark.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>)'s a very well-born and rich man, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) father was a Justice of the Peace, and known in London.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div>said Cora feelingly.

<p/>`That's where you'll find me, mother,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) says.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), poor soul, was frightened out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wits.
<p/>And father's worried too, for Ned can't go wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>).
<p/>Ned may always do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) likes, though I may not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Cora declared her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sympathy, but Mark did not take the incident as grave.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) assured Ned's brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Men that talk openly of killing themselves, never do it.
<p/>Words are a safety-valve.
<p/>'Tis the sort that go silent and cheerful under a great blow that be nearest death.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Cora spoke of Ned's looks with admiration and feared that this great disappointment might spoil them; but Milly was not so sympathetic.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) stood to work and didn't think so much about the maidens, they might think a bit more about him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) swears he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) won't play St. George now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rupert/Rupert Baskerville</b></font>)</div>added Rupert.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mark will be jealous then.
<p/>'Tis a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) don't play St. George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Milly/Milly Luscombe/Luscombe</b></font>)</div>said Milly.
<p/>But Mark laughed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A pretty St. George me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; I'm not jealous of Ned.
<p/>Safety in numbers, they say.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) be St. George and welcome; and very noble he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'ll look--if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s got brains enough in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) empty noddle to get the words and remember them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Cora cast a swift side glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) betrothed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) did not speak, but the look was not all love.
<p/>Discontent haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) for a little space.
<p/>The ginger-beer was drunk and the repast finished.
<p/>The men lighted their pipes; the girls talked together.
<p/>Milly congratulated Cora very heartily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>)'s a fine, witty chap, as I've always said.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>These things pleased the other, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) was still more pleased when Milly discussed Mark's father.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I often see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``oftener than you might think for.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>)'ll ride to Trowlesworthy twice and thrice a month sometimes.
<p/>Why for?
<p/>To see my uncle, you might fancy.
<p/>But that's not the reason.
<p/>To talk with Jack he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) comes.
<p/>Jack Head and me be the only people in these parts that ban't afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).
<p/>And that's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) likes.
<p/>You be fearless of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), Cora, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>)'ll think nought of thee.
<p/>Fearless and attentive to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) says--that's the rule with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>).
<p/>And pretend nothing, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>)'ll see through it and pull you to pieces.
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) and Jack Head says the most tremendous things about the world and its ways.
<p/>They take Uncle Saul's breath away sometimes, and mine too.
<p/>But don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) frighten you--that's the fatal thing.
<p/>If a creature's feared of him (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) despises it.
<p/>Never look surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) speeches.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Cora listened to this advice and thanked the other girl for it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I care a button for the old man, anyway?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it comes to that, I'm as good as him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>There's nought to fear really, when all's said.
<p/>And I won't fear.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div><p/>The men strolled about the old village and gathered whortleberries; then Rupert judged that the storm that had skulked so long to the north, was coming at last.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'd best be getting down-along,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) said.
<p/>``Let's go across to Trowlesworthy; then, if it breaks, we can slip into the warren house a bit till the worst be over.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You be all coming to drink tea there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Milly/Milly Luscombe/Luscombe</b></font>)</div>said Milly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Uncle Saul and Jack Head are away, but aunt be home, and I made the cakes specially o' Saturday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the couples</b></font>)</div><p/>Drifting apart by a half a mile or so, the young couples left the Beacon, climbed Penshiel, and thence passed over the waste to where the red tor rose above Milly Luscombe's home.
<p/>A sort of twilight stole at four o'clock over the earth, and it seemed that night hastened up while yet the hidden sun was high.
<p/>The sinister sky darkened and frowned to bursting; yet no rain fell, and later it grew light again, as the sun, sinking beneath the ridges of the clouds, flooded the Moor with the greatest brightness that the day had known.
<p/>CHAPTER X  Some few weeks after it was known that young Mark Baskerville would marry Cora Lintern, a small company drank beer at `The White Thorn' and discussed local politics in general, and the engagement in particular.
<p/>The time was three in the afternoon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll look to you for a wedding present without a doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gollop/Gollop</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gollop to Nathan, who stood behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) bar.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And they'll be right,''  (<font color='red'><b>the innkeeper</b></font>)</div>answered the innkeeper.

<p/>Mark's different--clever enough, but made of another clay.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) mother was a retiring, humble woman--frightened of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own shadow, you might say.
<p/>However, Cora will wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) into a cheerfuller conceit of himself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div><p/>There was an interruption, for Dennis Masterman suddenly filled the doorway.

<p/>I hate to see him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) running after the ball at cricket, like a school-child.
<p/>'Tisn't decent, and it lessens the force of the man in the pulpit come Sunday, just as it lessened the force of physician Dawe to Tavistock when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawe</b></font>) took to singing comic songs at the penny readings.
<p/>Why, 'twas money out of the doctor's pocket, as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) lived to find out, too late.
<p/>When Old Master Trelawny lay dying, and they axed un to let Dawe have a slap at un, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawe</b></font>) wouldn't do it.
<p/>`Be that the man that sang the song about locking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother-in-law into the coal-cellar?'
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) axed.
<p/>`The same,' said they; `but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a terrible clever chap at the stomach, and may save you yet if there be enough of your organs left for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to work upon.'
<p/>`No, no,' says old Trelawny.
<p/>`Such a light-minded feller as that couldn't be trusted with a dying man's belly.'
<p/>I don't say 'twas altogether reasonable, because the wisest must unbend the bow now and again; but I will maintain that that minister of the Lord didn't ought to take off his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) coat and get in a common sweat afore the people assembled at a cricket match.
<p/>'Tis worse than David making a circus of himself afore the holy ark; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) does so, he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) must take the consequences.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The consequences be that everybody will think a lot better of him (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>), as a manly and sensible chap, wishful to help the young men,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>declared Mr. Baskerville.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One thing I can bear witness to: I don't get the Saturday custom I used to get, and that's to the good, anyway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hacker</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Hacker rang the bell, and the thin, black figure of Humphrey Baskerville appeared and began to creep down the side of the hill.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) shook hands and hoped that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother was well.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A harvest to make up for last year,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) relapsed into a long silence, and Cora's remarks were rewarded with no more than nods of affirmation or negation.
<p/>Then, suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) broke out on the subject of apparel long after she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) had forgotten it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Terrible tearing fine I suppose you think your clothes are, young woman--terrible tearing fine; but I hate 'em, and they ill become a poor man's wife and a poor man's daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to say the thing that will please you, if I can.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mark says puzzling things like that sometimes.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ride a pony, don't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) asked presently; and the girl brightened up.

<p/>Upon the tor he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) many things concerning the clouds above them, the cries of the birds, and the names of the flowers.
<p/>The ordeal proved terrible, because her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) ignorance of these matters was almost absolute.

<p/>Once out of sight of the old man she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) slowed down, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) wrongs and affronts crowded upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) bosom pant.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) clenched her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) hands and bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) handkerchief.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) desired to weep, but intended that others should see her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) tears.
<p/>Therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) controlled them until she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) reached home, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) cried copiously in the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) mother, her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) sister, and Nathan Baskerville, who had come to learn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) success.
<p/>The directions of Mark, to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) at Torry stepping-stones, Cora had entirely forgotten.
<p/>Nor would she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) have kept the appointment had she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) remembered it.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) storm of passion she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) hated even Mark for being his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) father's son.

<p/>Another aspect of the case suddenly presented itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>), and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) grew calmer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) decided to keep out of this quarrel, though natural instincts drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) into it.
<p/>A few moments later, as thought progressed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) found himself wishing that Humphrey would die.
<p/>But the desire neither surprised nor shocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) had often wished it before.
<p/>Humphrey's life was of no apparent service to Humphrey, while to certain other people it could only be regarded in the light of a hindrance.
<p/>CHAPTER XI  Some days later Mark Baskerville spoke with Mrs. Lintern, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) was relieved to find that Cora's fears had been exaggerated.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) said very little indeed about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>), except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) didn't like her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) clothes and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) had a poor appetite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mark/Mark Baskerville</b></font>)</div>explained Mark.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) a thousand questions, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) wouldn't answer them.
<p/>I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) knows in the least how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) flustered Cora.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) said one queer thing that I couldn't see sense in, though perhaps you may.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) said, `She (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>)'s told me more about herself than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) knows herself--and more than I'll tell again--even to you, though some might think it a reason against her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>).'
<p/>Whatever did he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) mean by that?
<p/>But it don't much matter, anyway, and my Cora's quite wrong to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) was a failure or anything of that kind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) asked only this morning, as natural as possible, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) was coming over again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>These statements satisfied the girl's mother, but they failed to calm Cora herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) took the matter much to heart, caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) lover many unquiet and anxious hours, and refused point-blank for the present to see Mr. Baskerville.
<p/>Then fell the great first rehearsal of the Christmas play, and Dennis Masterman found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) had been wise to take time by the forelock in this matter.
<p/>The mummers assembled in the parish room, and the vicar and his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) sister, with Nathan Baskerville's assistance, strove to lead them through the drama.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not going to be quite like the version that a kind friend has sent me, and from which your parts are written,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div>explained Dennis.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've arranged for an introduction in the shape of a prologue.
<p/>I shall do this myself, and appear before the curtain and speak a speech to explain what it is all about.
<p/>This answers Mr. Waite here, who is going to be the Turkish Knight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) didn't want to begin the piece.
<p/>Now I shall have broken the ice, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) will be discovered as the curtain rises.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Waite/Mr. Waite</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Timothy Waite on this occasion, however, began proceedings, as the vicar's prologue was not yet written.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) proved letter-perfect but exceedingly nervous.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Open your doors and let me in, I hope your favours I shall win.
<p/>Whether I rise or whether I fall, I'll do my best to please you all!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Waite/Mr. Waite</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Waite spoke jerkily, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) voice proved a little out of control, but everybody congratulated him (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) rolls his (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) eyes to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vivian/Vivian Baskerville/Mr. Vivian Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Vivian Baskerville.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very daps of a Turk, for sartain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to stride about more, Waite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>suggested Ned Baskerville, who had cheered up of recent days, and was now standing beside Cora and other girls destined to assist the play.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The great thing is to stride about and look alive--isn't it, Mr.
<p/>Masterman?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll talk afterwards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div>answered Dennis.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We mustn't interfere with the action.
<p/>You have got your speech off very well, Waite, but you said it much too fast.
<p/>We must be slow and distinct, so that not a word is missed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Waite/Mr. Waite</b></font>)</div><p/>Timothy, who enjoyed the praise of his (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) friends, liked this censure less.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``As for speaking fast,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the man would speak fast.
<p/>Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) expects St. George will be on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) tail in a minute.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) says, 'I know he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'ll pierce my skin.'
<p/>In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s pretty well sweating with terror from the first moment he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) comes on the stage, I should reckon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mr. Masterman was unprepared for any such subtle rendering of the Turkish Knight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) only hoped that the more ancient play-actors would not come armed with equally obstinate opinions.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll talk about it afterwards,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you go off to the right, Waite, and Father Christmas comes on at the left.
<p/>Mr. Baskerville--Father Christmas, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>Nathan put his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) part into his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) pocket, marched on to the imaginary stage and bowed.
<p/>Everybody cheered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't bow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div>explained Dennis; but the innkeeper differed from him (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I must, your reverence.
<p/>When I appear before them, the people will give me a lot of applause in their usual kindly fashion.
<p/>Why, even these here--just t`other actors do, you see--so you may be sure that the countryside will.
<p/>Therefore I had better practise the bow at rehearsal, if you've no great argument against it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, push on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div>said Dennis.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must really be quicker,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Masterman/Masterman</b></font>)</div>declared Miss Masterman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Half an hour has gone, and we've hardly started.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Off I go then; and I want you chaps--especially you, Vivian, and you, Jack Head, and you, Tom Gollop--to watch me acting.
<p/>Acting ban't the same as ordinary talking.
<p/>If I was just talking, I should say all quiet, without flinging my arms about, and walking round, and stopping, and then away again.
<p/>But in acting you do all these things, and instead of merely saying your speeches, as we would, just man to man, over my bar or in the street, you have to bawl 'em out so that every soul in the audience catches 'em.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Having thus explained his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) theory of histrionics Mr. Baskerville started, and with immense and original emphasis, and sudden actions and gestures, introduced himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here come I, the dear old Father Christmas.
<p/>Welcome or welcome not, I hope old Father Christmas Will never be forgot.
<p/>A room--make room here, gallant boys, And give us room to rhyme--''    (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>Nathan broke off to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) reading of the part.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I say `make room' I fly all round the stage, as if I was pushing the people back to give me room.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) speech, and panted and mopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's acting, and what d'you think of it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) asked.
<p/>They all applauded vigorously excepting Mr. Gollop, who now prepared to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) part.
<p/>Nathan then left the stage and the vicar called him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) back.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't go off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) explained.

<p/>Then Ned proceeded--  <div class="bookquote">``I fought the Russian Bear And brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) to the slaughter; By that I won fair Sabra, The King of Egypt's daughter.

 (<font color='red'><b>The girls</b></font>)</div><p/>The girls, glad of something to do, sang vigorously, and the song went well.

 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Baskerville bellowed with laughter and slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) immense thigh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dammy!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, St. George, kill the Giant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div>commanded Dennis.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Giant will have a club, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dennis</b></font>)'ll try to smash you; then you run him (<font color='blue'><b>Dennis</b></font>) through the body.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care you don't hit Ned in real earnest, however, else you'd settle him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) and spoil the play,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Voysey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Voysey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it, Ned?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>Nathan and Ned's sisters appreciated this family joke.
<p/>Then Mr. Gollop advanced a sentimental objection.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may be wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) admitted, <div class="bookquote">``but I can't help thinking it might be a bit ondecent for Ned Baskerville here to kill his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) father, even in play.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'm a silly old grandmother, and never no King of Egypt was such a fool afore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div>said Jack.

 (<font color='red'><b>Gollop/Eliza/Eliza Gollop</b></font>)</div><p/>Gollop snarled at Head, and they began to wrangle fiercely.

 (<font color='red'><b>Hawk House/House</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XII  In a triangle the wild land of the Rut sloped down from Hawk House to the valley beneath, and its solitary time of splendour belonged to Spring, when the great furzes were blooming and the white thorns filled the valley with light.
<p/>Hither came Mark to keep tryst with Cora beside the stream.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) walked not loverly but languid, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) mind was in trouble, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) gait reflected it.
<p/>To water's brink he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) came, sat on a familiar stump above Torry Brook, and watched sunshine play over the ripples and a dance of flies upon the sunshine.
<p/>Looked at in a mass, the insects seemed no more than a glimmering, like a heat haze, over the water and against the background of the woods; but noted closer the plan and pattern of these myriads showed method: the little storm of flies gyrated in a circle, and while the whole cluster swept this way and that with the proper motion of the mass, yet each individual, like planets round the sun, revolved about a definite but shifting centre.
<p/>The insects whirled round and round, rose and sank again, each atom describing repeated circles; and though the united motion of this company suspended here in air appeared inconceivably rapid and dazzling, yet the progress of each single gnat was not fast.
<p/>Mark observed this little galaxy of glittering lives, and, knowing some natural history, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) considered intelligently the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) saw.
<p/>For a moment it distracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>).
<p/>A warm noon had wakened innumerable brief existences that a cold night would still again.
<p/>All this immense energy must soon cease and the ephemeral atoms perish at the chill touch of evening; but to Nature it mattered neither more nor less if a dance of nebul√¶ or a dance of gnats should make an end that night.
<p/>Countless successions of both were a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) work.
<p/>From awful marriages of ancient suns new suns would certainly be born; and out of this midge dance here above the water, potential dances for another day were ensured, before the little system sank to rest, the aureole of living light became extinguished.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) turned from the whirl and wail of the gnats to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) own thoughts, and found them also revolving restlessly.
<p/>But their sun and centre was Cora.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) here, in a favourite and secret place, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) might speak harsh things to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>).
<p/>There was no love-making toward just now.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) had angered him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) once and again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) considered his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) grievances, strove to palliate them, and see all with due allowance; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) habit of mind, if vague, was not unjust.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) passionately, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) should put deliberate indignities upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) argued a faulty reciprocity of love.
<p/>Time had revealed that Cora did not care for Mark as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) cared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>); and that would not have mattered--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) held it reasonable.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) desired a larger measure of affection and respect than he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) had received.
<p/>Then to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) quick senses even the existing affection diminished, and respect appeared to die.
<p/>These dire shadows had risen out of the rehearsals for the play.
<p/>Cora's attitude towards other young men first astonished Mark and then annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) annoyance to himself, however, for fear of being laughed at.
<p/>Then, thanks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) cousin, Ned Baskerville, and the young farmer, Timothy Waite, he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) was laughed at, for Cora found these youths better company than Mark himself, and Jack Head and others did not hesitate to rally him (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) indifferent lady.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s more gracious with either of them than with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) reflected.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, actually, when I offered as usual to walk home with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) last week, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said yonder man had promised to do so and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) need not trouble me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes where a farm showed on the hills westerly through the trees.
<p/>Coldstone was a prosperous place, and the freehold of a prosperous man, young Waite, the Turkish Knight of the play.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) had seen Cora home according to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wish, and Mark had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) temper and afterwards made the present appointment by letter.
<p/>Now Cora came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>), late from another interview--but concerning it she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said nothing.
<p/>On her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) way from Undershaugh it happened that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had fallen in with Mark's father.
<p/>The old man rode his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pony, and Cora was passing him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) hastily when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) stopped and called her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>).
<p/>They had not met since the occasion of the girl's first and last visit to Hawk House.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come hither,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've fretted you, it seems, and set you against me.
<p/>I'm sorry for that.
<p/>You should be made of stouter stuff.
<p/>Shake hands with me, Cora, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) hand and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took it silently.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll turn and go a bit of your road.
<p/>If you intend to marry my son, you must make shift to be my daughter, you see.
<p/>What was it made you so cross that you ran away?
<p/>But I know--I spoke against your clothes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You spoke against everything.
<p/>I felt in every drop of blood in my body that you didn't like me.
<p/>That's why I had to run.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was silent a moment.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) pointed to one faint gold torch above their heads, where a single bough of an elm was autumn-painted, and began to glow on the bosom of a tree still green.
<p/>It stood out shining against the deep summer darkness of the foliage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What d'you make of that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) asked.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) looked up.
<p/>'''Tis winter coming again, I suppose.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--winter for us, death for the leaves.
<p/>I'm like that--I'm frost-bitten here and there--in places.
<p/>'Twas a frosty day with me when you came to dinner.
<p/>I'm sorry I hurt you.
<p/>But you must be sensible.
<p/>It's a lot harder to be a good wife than a popular maiden.
<p/>My son Mark will need a strong-minded woman, not a silly one.
<p/>The question is, are you going to rise to it?
<p/>However, we'll leave that.
<p/>How did you know in every drop of your blood, as you say, that you'd failed to please me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew it by--oh, by everything.
<p/>By your eyes and by the tone of your voice.
<p/>You said you wanted to talk to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I did.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never asked me nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was no need, you told me everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said all I wanted to hear and told me a lot more than I wanted, or expected, to hear for that matter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I don't understand you, Mr.
<p/>Baskerville.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No need--no need.
<p/>That's only to say you're like the rest.
<p/>They wonder how 'tis they don't understand me--fools that they are!--and yet how many understand themselves?
<p/>I'll tell you this: you're not the right wife for Mark.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I won't marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>).
<p/>There's quite as good as him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>), and better, for that matter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Plenty.
<p/>Take young Waite from Coldstone Farm, for instance.
<p/>A strong man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is.
<p/>My son Mark is a weak man--a gentle character he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) hath.
<p/>'Tis the strong men--they that want things--that alter the face of the world, and make history, and help the breed--not such as Mark.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>)'d spoil you and bring out all the very worst of you.
<p/>Such a man as Waite would do different.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>)'d not stand your airs and graces, and little silly whims and fancies.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>)'d break you in; he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>)'d tame you; and you'd look back afterwards and thank God you fell to a strong man and not a weak one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Women marry for love, not for taming,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) said.

<p/>You ban't built to love, if you want to know the whole truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered calmly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You belong to a sort of woman who takes all and gives nought.
<p/>I wish I could ope your eyes to yourself, but I suppose that's beyond human power.
<p/>But this I'll say: I wish you nothing but good; and the best good of all for such a one as you is to get a glimpse of yourself through a sensible and not unkindly pair of eyes.
<p/>If you are going to marry Mark, and want to be a happy woman and wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) to be a happy man, you must think of a lot of things beside your wedding frock.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For two pins I wouldn't marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) at all after this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm only telling you what I've often told myself.
<p/>I'm always open to hear sense from any man, save now and again when I find myself in a black mood and won't hear anything.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't want to give me good advice,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face was red and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice high; <div class="bookquote">``you only want to make me think small things of myself, and despise myself, and to choke me off Mark.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To choke you off Mark might be the best advice anybody could give you, for that matter, my dear; and as to your thinking small things of yourself--no such luck I see.
<p/>You'll go on thinking a lot of your little, empty self till you stop thinking for good and all.
<p/>Life ban't going to teach you anything worth knowing, because you've stuffed up your ears with self-conceit and vanity.
<p/>So go your way; but if you get a grain of sense come back to me, and I shall be very glad to hear about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) standing still in a mighty temper.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) felt inclined to fling a stone after him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
<p/>And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) rejoiced at the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) heart, because this scene made her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) future actions easier.
<p/>Only one thing still held her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to Mark Baskerville, and that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) money.
<p/>The sickly ghost of regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>), which she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was pleased to call love, existed merely as the answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) conscience.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had never loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>), but when the opportunity came, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could not refuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) worldly wealth and the future of successful comfort it promised.
<p/>Now, however, were appearing others who attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) far more.
<p/>Two men had entered into her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) life since the rehearsals, and both pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) better than Mark.
<p/>One she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) liked for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) person and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) charms of manner and of speech; the other for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) masterful character and large prosperity.
<p/>One was better looking than Mark, and knew far better how to worship a woman; the other was perhaps as rich as Mark would be, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) appealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) much more by virtue of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) masculinity and vigour.
<p/>Mr. Baskerville had actually mentioned this individual during the recent conversation; and it was of him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>), too, that Mark considered where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) sat and waited for Cora by the stream.
<p/>But though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt Timothy Waite's value, yet a thing even stronger drew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to the other man.
<p/>Ned Baskerville was the handsomest, gallantest, most fascinating creature that Cora had ever known.
<p/>Chance threw them little together until the rehearsals, but since then they had met often, and advanced far along a road of mutual admiration.
<p/>Like clove to like, and the emptiness of each heart struck a kindred echo from the other; but neither appreciated the hollowness of the sound.
<p/>Under these circumstances Humphrey Baskerville's strictures, though exceedingly painful to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) self-love, were not unwelcome, for they made the thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) designed to do reasonable and proper.
<p/>It would be simple to quote his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) father to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) betrothed when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) over.
<p/>In this temper Cora now appeared to Mark.
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) been aware of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) might have hesitated before adding further fuel to the flames.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) began in a friendly fashion, rose and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're late, Cora.
<p/>Look here.
<p/>Sit down and get cool and watch these flies.
<p/>The merry dancers, they are called, and well they may be.
<p/>'Tis a regular old country measure they seem to tread in the air--figure in and cross over and all--just like you do when you go through the old dance in the play.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was in no mood of softness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A tidy lot of dancing I'll get when I'm married to you!
<p/>You know you hate it, and hate everything else with any joy and happiness to it.
<p/>You're only your father over again, when all's said, and God defend me from him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!
<p/>I can't stand no more of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and I won't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've met him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mark/Mark Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mark.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was afraid you might.
<p/>I'm sorry for that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so sorry as I am.
<p/>If I was dirt by the road he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) couldn't have treated me worse.
<p/>And I'm not going to suffer it--never once more--not if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) was ten times your father!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) say?
<p/>Not a kind word, anyway.
<p/>And 'tis vain your sticking up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) don't think any better of you than he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) do of me seemingly.
<p/>'Twas to that man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pointed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arm towards the farm through the trees.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks a lot more of Timothy Waite than he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) does of you, I can tell you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll talk to father.
<p/>This can't go on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it can't go on.
<p/>Life's too short for this sort of thing.
<p/>I won't be bullied by anybody.
<p/>People seem to forget who I am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't talk so, Cora.
<p/>I'm terrible sorry about it; but father's father, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll go his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own rough way, and you ought to know what way that is by now.
<p/>Don't take it to heart--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) means well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>''`Heart!'
<p/>I've got no heart according to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--no heart, no sense, no nothing.
<p/>Just a dummy to show off pretty clothes.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never said that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did; and worse, and I'm tired of it.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose not; but I've got my self-respect, and I can't marry the son of a man that despises me openly like he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not given her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) time to strike the definite blow.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) supposed that it was as good as struck.
<p/>After such a departure and such words, they could not meet again even as friends.
<p/>The engagement was definitely at an end in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind, for by no stretch of imagination might this be described as a lovers' quarrel.
<p/>All was over; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rejoiced at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) renewal of liberty and resolved not to see Mark any more, no matter how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) desired it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flung away the luncheon that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had brought and set off for home, trusting that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might meet Humphrey Baskerville upon the way.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) longed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) again now and repay him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) for a little of the indignity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had put upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not meet Mark's father.
<p/>On the evening of the same day a congenial spirit won slight concessions from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Ned Baskerville arrived on some pretext concerning the play.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) knew very well by this time that, in the matter of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) engagement, Cora was a victim, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) felt, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) had often felt before in other cases, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was the only woman on earth to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) a happy man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) despised Mark and experienced little compunction with respect to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>).
<p/>Upon this night Mrs. Lintern was out, and Cora made no objection to putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) hat and going to the high ground above Shaugh Prior to look at the moon.
<p/>''`Twon't take above ten minutes, and then I'll see you back,'' said Ned.
<p/>They went together, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) flattered her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) and paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) many compliments and humbled himself before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) purred and was pleased.
<p/>They moved along together and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) was like the princess in the play.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say nought, but, my God, you look every inch a princess!
<p/>If 'twas real life, I'd slay fifty giants and a hundred bears for you, Cora.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mark's out of the way then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Ned.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that I'm afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>), or any other man.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sick of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) bell-ringing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) said violently.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So would any maiden be.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mark/Mark Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Elsewhere in the belfry Mark rang himself into better humour.
<p/>The labour physicked his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) grief and soothed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) soul.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) told himself that all the fault was his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>), and when the chimes were still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) coat and went to Undershaugh to beg forgiveness.
<p/>Phyllis met him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cora's out walking,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Out walking!

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) asked.
<p/>But Phyllis was nothing if not cautious.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) had more heart, but not more conscience than her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) sister.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know--alone, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) answered.
<p/>CHAPTER XIII  A day of storm buffeted the Moor.
<p/>Fitful streaks of light roamed through a wild and silver welter of low cloud; and now they rested on a pool or river, and the water flashed; and now they fired the crests of the high lands or made the ruddy brake-fern flame.
<p/>Behind Shaugh Moor was storm-cloud, and beneath it, oozing out into the valleys, extended the sullen green of water-logged fields hemmed in with autumnal hedges.
<p/>Hither came Mark Baskerville on his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) way to Shaugh, and then a man stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and changed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plan.
<p/>For some time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had neither seen nor heard from Cora, and unable longer to live with this cloud between them, Mark was now on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) way to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>).
<p/>Consideration had convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) was much in fault, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) did well to keep aloof until he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) came penitent back again; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) had already striven more than once to do so, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) had refused to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) told himself that it was natural she (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) should feel angered at the past, and natural that she (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) should be in no haste to make up so serious a quarrel.
<p/>But the catastrophe had now shrunk somewhat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) estimation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) doubted not that Cora, during the passage of many days, also began to see it in its proper perspective.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) did not wholly regret their difference, and certain words that she (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) had spoken still stung painfully when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) considered them; but the dominant hunger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) mind was to get back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>), kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) lips and hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) voice again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) would be very circumspect henceforth, and doubtless so would she (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) felt sure that Cora regretted their difference now, and that the time was over-ripe for reconciliation.
<p/>The next rehearsal would take place upon the following day, and Mark felt that friendly relations must be re-established before that event.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) road to see Cora and take no further denial, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) brother met him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucky I ran against you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div>said Heathman; <div class="bookquote">``I've got a letter for you from my sister, and meant to leave it on my way out over to Lee Moor.
<p/>Coarse weather coming by the look of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mark/Mark Baskerville</b></font>)</div>answered Mark.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've saved me a journey then.
<p/>I was bound for Undershaugh.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Heathman, who knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) bore evil news, departed quickly, while the other, with true instinct of sybarite, held the precious letter a moment before opening it.
<p/>It happened that Cora seldom wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>), for they met very often; but now, having a difficult thing to say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathman</b></font>) sought this medium, and Mark, knowing not the truth, was glad.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like me--couldn't keep it up no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I almost wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathman</b></font>)'d let me say I was sorry first; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathman</b></font>) might have heard me say so a week ago, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathman</b></font>)'d liked.
<p/>Thank Heaven we shall be happy again before dark.
<p/>I'll promise everything in the world she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathman</b></font>) wants to-night--even to the ring with the blue stone she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathman</b></font>) hungered after at Plymouth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) looked round, then the wind hustled him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) and the rain broke in a tattered veil along the edge of the hill.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll get up to Hawk Tor, and lie snug there, and read her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathman</b></font>) letter in the lew place I filled with fern for her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawk</b></font>) thought.
<p/>There was a natural cavern facing west upon this height, and here, in a nook sacred to Cora, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) sat presently and lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) pipe and so came to the pleasant task.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) determined that having read her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathman</b></font>) plea for forgiveness, it would be impossible to wait until nightfall without seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathman</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go down and take dinner with them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) decided: then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) read the letter:--   ``DEAR MARK,  ``After what happened a little while ago you cannot be surprised if I say I will not marry you.
<p/>There is nothing to be said about it except that I have quite made up my mind.
<p/>I have thought about it ever since, and not done nothing in a hurry.
<p/>We would not suit one another, and the older we grew, the worse we should quarrel.
<p/>So it will be better to part before any harm is done.
<p/>You will easily find a quieter sort of girl, without so much spirit as me.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will suit you better than what I do.
<p/>I have told my mother that I am not going to marry you.
<p/>And Mr. Nathan Baskerville, your own uncle, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) is very sorry indeed about it, is our family friend and adviser, and he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) says it is better we understand and part at once.
<p/>I hope you won't make any fuss, as  nothing will change me .
<p/>And you will have the pleasure of knowing your father will be thankful.
<p/>No doubt you will soon find a better-looking and nicer girl than me, and somebody that your father won't treat the same as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) treated  ``Yours truly, <div class="bookquote">``CORA LINTERN.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Through the man's stunned grief and above the chaos of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thoughts, one paramount and irrevocable conviction reigned.
<p/>Cora meant what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wrote, and nothing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) had power to say or to do would win her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would never change; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) in anger and the sight had determined her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had met his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) father and had felt that such antagonism must ruin her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) possessed imagination and was able swiftly to feel what life must mean without her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) believed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) days would be impossible henceforth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) read the letter again and marked how she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) began with restraint and gradually wrote herself into anger.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) smarted when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) reflected on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) father; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) soon convinced himself that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) father who had driven her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to these conclusions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) told himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) did not blame her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>The pipe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) mouth had been given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) by Cora.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) emptied it now, put it into its case, rose up and went home.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) planned the things to say to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) father and determined to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) the letter.
<p/>Mark desired to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) father suffer, and did not doubt but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) would suffer when this catastrophe came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) ears.
<p/>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) father appeared before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), far off, driven by the wind; and Mark, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) tortured mind, marvelled to think that a thing so small as this dim spot, hastening like a dead leaf along, should have been powerful enough, and cruel enough, deliberately to ruin his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) life.
<p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) was now obsessed by the belief that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) father alone must be thanked for the misfortune.
<p/>They came together, and Humphrey shouted to be heard against the riot of the wind.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) hat was pressed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) ears; the tails of his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) coat and the hair on his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) head leapt and danced; his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) eyes were watering.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A brave wind!

<p/>What are you doing up here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Read that,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said the other, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father stopped and stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Despite the rough air and the wild music of heath and stone, Mark's passion was not hidden and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) face as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) voice proclaimed it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``See what you have done for your only son,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) cried.
<p/>Humphrey held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) hand for the letter, took it and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) back to the wind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) read it slowly, then returned it to Mark.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) means that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) answered.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) stood and stared at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) fallen hopes and ruined plans; while from a dry spot beside the wall, there came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) the sweet, sleepy chirruping of chickens that cuddled together under their mother's wings.
<p/>CHAPTER XIV  While the desolation of Mark Baskerville came to be learnt, and some sympathised with him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) and some held that Cora Lintern had showed a very proper spirit to refuse a man cursed with such a father, lesser trouble haunted Cadworthy Farm, for the parent of Rupert Baskerville declared himself to be suffering from a great grievance.
<p/>Vivian was an obstinate man and would not yield to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) son's demand; but the situation rapidly reached a climax, for Rupert would not yield either.
<p/>Night was the farmer's time for long discussions with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) wife; and there came a moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) faced the present crisis with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and strove for some solution of the difficulty.

<p/>CHAPTER XV  Some weeks after Christmas had passed, Mr. Joseph Voysey and others met at `The White Thorn' and played chorus to affairs according to their custom.
<p/>The great subject of discussion was still the play.
<p/>It had been enacted twice to different audiences, and it proved but an indifferent success.
<p/>Everybody agreed that the entertainment promised better than its ultimate performance.
<p/>At rehearsal all went well; upon the night of the display a thousand mishaps combined to lessen its effect.
<p/>Joe Voysey summed up to Thomas Gollop, who sat and drank with him (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What with us all being so busy about Christmas, and the weather, and Nathan here getting a cold on his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) chest and only being able to croak like a frog, and parson losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) temper with Head at the last rehearsal, and other things, it certainly failed.
<p/>'Tis a case of least said soonest mended; but I'm keeping this mask of the French Eagle what I wore, for it makes a very pretty ornament hanged over my parlour mantelshelf.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In my judgment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>declared Nathan, '''twas Jack Head that played the mischief with the show.
<p/>After parson cooled him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) down at rehearsal, I allow he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) went a bit lighter on his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) part and didn't act quite so forcible, but well I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) was saving it up for the night; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) was.
<p/>'Twas all Jack all the time, and even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was supposed to be dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) must still keep growling to make the people laugh.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s had a right down row with Mr. Masterman since.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A make-strife sort of man; and yet a cheerful man; and yet, again, a very rebellious man against the powers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe Voysey/Joe/Voysey</b></font>)</div>said Voysey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, 'tis over and it shows, like everything else do, how much may grow out of little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>added Nathan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a bit of fun at Christmas, you'd say, wouldn't leave no very great mark, yet--look at it--how far-reaching.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's brought the eyes of the county on us, as I said it would,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parish clerk</b></font>)</div>replied the parish clerk.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Rural Dean was here afterwards and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) luncheon at the vicarage and came to the church to see the font-cover; but Nancy Mumford--maiden to the vicarage--waits at table, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) told my sister that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mumford</b></font>) reverence said to Mr. Masterman that we'd fallen between two stools and that the performance was a sort of a mongrel between a modern pantomime and the old miracle play, and that the masks and such-like were out of order.
<p/>And Miss Masterman was a bit acid with the Rural Dean and said, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) face, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>)'d only had to see the thing through, as they had, she (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) was sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>)'d be more charitable like about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Us shan't have no more play-acting, mark me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe Voysey/Joe/Voysey</b></font>)</div>foretold Joe Voysey; then others entered the bar, among them being Saul Luscombe from Trowlesworthy and Heathman Lintern.
<p/>The warrener was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) way home and stayed only for a pint and a few friendly words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should hear Jack Head tell about the play,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) should hear us tell about him (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe Voysey/Joe/Voysey</b></font>)</div>answered Voysey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jack, so near as damn it, spoilt the play.
<p/>In fact, innkeeper here thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) did do so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) vows that he (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) saved the whole job from being a hugeous failure.
<p/>And young farmer Waite swears 'twas Miss Lintern as the Princess that saved it; and Mr. Ned, your nephew, Nathan--he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) swears 'twas himself that saved it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I think 'twas I that saved it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Gollop</b></font>)</div>declared Thomas.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``However, enough said.
<p/>'Tis of the past and will soon be forgot, like a dead man out of mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's where you're wrong, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div>said Heathman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't forget a thing so easy.
<p/>Besides, there's all that hangs to it.
<p/>There's Polly Baskerville, that was one of Cora's maidens in the play, got engaged to be married on the strength of it--to Nick Bassett--him (<font color='blue'><b>Bassett</b></font>) as waited on the Turkish Knight.
<p/>And now--bigger news still for me and mine.
<p/>Cora's taken Ned Baskerville!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew it was going to happen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>admitted Nathan.
<p/>'''Tis a very delicate thing, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)'s only broken with the man's cousin a matter of a few months.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) mother asked me about it a bit ago.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got to remember this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div>said Heathman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have been the first to make a row--me being Cora's only brother and the only man responsible to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/>I say I should have been the first to make a row, for I was terrible savage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) and thought it hard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) to throw over Mark, just because his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) father was an old carmudgeon.
<p/>But seeing how Mark took it--''   (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Luscombe</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To the eye, I grant you that; but these quiet chaps as hide their feelings often feel a lot more than they show,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Luscombe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Luscombe.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) was hard hit, and well I know it, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) father told me so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>continued Nathan Baskerville.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother, Humphrey, in a sort of way, blamed me and Mrs. Lintern, and, in fact, everybody but himself.
<p/>One minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) said that Mark was well out of it, and the next he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) got to be very jealous for Mark and told me that people were caballing against his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) son.
<p/>I go in fear of meeting my brother now, for when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) hears that Cora Lintern is going to take Ned Baskerville, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>)'ll think 'twas all a plot and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>)'ll rage on Mark's account.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mark/Mark Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>'''Tis Mark that I fear for,'' said Heathman; then Gollop suddenly stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) cried, and held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) hand.
<p/>After a brief silence, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) begged young Lintern to proceed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I heard something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear for Mark,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued the other, <div class="bookquote">``because I happen to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) still secretly hoped a bit.
<p/>I don't like my sister Cora none too well, and I reckon Mark's worth a million of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) I was glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) so cheerful about it.
<p/>`You'm very wise to keep up your pecker, Mark,' I said to the man; `because she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'m not your sort really.
<p/>I know her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) better than you do and can testify to it.'
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) said I mustn't talk so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) told me, very private, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) hadn't gived up all hope.
<p/>Poor chap, I can let it out now, for he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) knows 'tis all over now.
<p/>`While she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s free, there's a chance,' he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) told me.
<p/>'I won't never think,' he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) said, `that all that's passed between us is to be blown away at a breath of trouble like this.'
<p/>That's how he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) put it, and I could see by the hollow, wisht state of his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) nerves all ajolt, that he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'d been through a terrible lot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'d built on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) coming round, poor fellow--eh?
<p/>That's why he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) put such a brave face on it then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>murmured Nathan.
<p/>Then Voysey spoke again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``As it happens, I can tell you the latest thing about him (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was to work two days agone `pon the edge of our garden, doing nought in particular because the frost was got in the ground and you couldn't put a spade in.
<p/>But I was busy as a bee according to my wont--tying up pea-sticks I think 'twas, or setting a rat-trap, or some such thing--when who should pass down t`other side of the hedge but Mark Baskerville?
<p/>Us fell into talk about the play, and I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) down to my house to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) where my grand-darter had stuck the mask what made me into the French Eagle.
<p/>Then I said there were changes in the air, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) said so too.
<p/>I remarked as Rupert Baskerville had left Cadworthy and gone to work at the Lee Moor china clay, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) said `Yes; and I be going too.'
<p/>`Never!'
<p/>I said.
<p/>`What'll Mr. Humphrey do without you?'
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) didn't know or care.
<p/>`Who ever will ring your bell when you're gone?'
<p/>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>), and--''   (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Gollop</b></font>)</div>Thomas Gollop again interrupted.
<p/>'''Tis a terrible queer thing you should name the bell, Joe,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``for I'll take my oath somebody's ringing it now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ringing the bell!
<p/>What be talking of?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Heathman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, 'tis hard on ten o'clock.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet I'm right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Saul Luscombe/Saul</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment Saul Luscombe, who had set out a minute sooner, returned.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's ago?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The bell's tolling.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They crowded to the door, stood under the clear stillness of night, and heard the bell.
<p/>At intervals of a minute the deep, sonorous note throbbed from aloft where the church tower rose against the stars.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nobody sick to death that I know about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>said Nathan.
<p/>''`Twill be Mark ringing, no doubt.
<p/>None touches tenor bell but him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>).''
<p/>Mr. Luscombe remounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Luscombe</b></font>) pony.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cold bites shrewd after your bar, Nathan.
<p/>Good night, souls.
<p/>Us shall hear who 'tis to-morrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The bell tolled thrice more; then it stopped.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bide a minute and I'll come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gollop/Gollop</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gollop.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't sleep this night without knowing who 'tis.
<p/>A very terrible sudden seizure, for certain.
<p/>Eliza may know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) crossed the road and entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) own house, which stood against the churchyard wall.
<p/>They waited and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) returned in a minute.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) knows nought,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mark dropped in a little bit ago and axed for the key.
<p/>`What do 'e want in belfry now, Mr.

<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) axed him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/>`Passing bell,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said; and Eliza was all agog, of course, for 'twas the first she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>)'d heard of it.
<p/>`What's the name?'
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) answered nought and went down the steps and away.
<p/>A minute after the bell began.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'''Tis over now, anyway.
<p/>I'll step across and meet Mark,'' said Mr. Baskerville.
<p/>One or two others accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>); but there was no sign of the ringer.
<p/>Then, led by Gollop, they entered the silent church and shouted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where be you, Mark Baskerville, and who's dead?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gollop/Eliza/Eliza Gollop</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Gollop.
<p/>In the belfry profound silence reigned, and the ropes hanging from their places above, touched the men as they groped in the darkness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)'s gone, anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>declared Nathan.
<p/>Then suddenly a man's boot rubbed against his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) face.
<p/>The impact moved it a moment; but it swung back heavily again.
<p/>The innkeeper yelled aloud, while Gollop fetched a lantern and lighted it.
<p/>Then they found that Mark Baskerville had fastened a length of stout cord to the great rope of the tenor bell at twenty feet above the floor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had mounted a ladder, drawn a tight loop round his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) neck, jumped into the air, and so destroyed himself.
<p/>CHAPTER XVI  Certain human dust lay in a place set apart from the main churchyard of St. Edward's.
<p/>Here newborn babies, that had perished before admission into the Christian faith, were buried, because the ministers of the church felt doubtful as to the salving of these unbaptised ones in another world.
<p/>The spot was known as `Chrisomers' Hill,' a name descended from ancient use.
<p/>By chrisom-cloths were first understood the anointed white garments put upon babes at baptism; and afterwards they came to mean the robes of the newly-baptised.
<p/>Infants were also shrouded in them if they perished a month after baptism; while a chrisom-child, or chrisomer, signified one who thus untimely died.
<p/>Among these fallen buds the late vicar of the parish had also buried a woman who took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own life; and Thomas Gollop, nothing doubting but that here, and only here, the body of Mark Baskerville might decently be laid, took it upon himself to dig the grave on Chrisomers' Hill.
<p/>But the ground was very hard and Thomas no longer possessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) old-time strength of arm.
<p/>Therefore a young man helped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and during the intervals of labour, the elder related incidents connected with past interments.
<p/>Some belonged to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own recollection; others had been handed down by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And touching these childer took off afore the holy water saved 'em, my parent held the old story of the Heath Hounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Gollop</b></font>)</div>concluded Thomas.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And there might be more in it than us later-day mortals have a right to deny.
<p/>For my father solemnly swore that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d heard 'em in winter gloamings hurrying through the air, for all the world like a flock of night-flying birds, and barking like good-uns in full cry after the Dowl.
<p/>'Tis Satan that keeps 'em out of the joys of Paradise; but only for a time, you must know, because these here babbies never done a stroke of wrong, being too young for it; and therefore, in right and reason, they will be catched up into Heaven at the last.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But no doubt 'tis different if a human takes their own life,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Different altogether,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gollop/Gollop</b></font>)</div>declared Mr. Gollop.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To take your own life be to go to a party afore you'm invited--a very presumpshuss and pushing thing, to say the least.
<p/>No charity will cover it.
<p/>For argument's sake, we'll say as I cut my throat, and then I stand afore the Throne of Grace so soon as the life be out of me.
<p/>`Who be you?'
<p/>says the A'mighty.
<p/>`Thomas Gollop, your Reverence,' says I.
<p/>Then they fetch the Books and it all comes out that I've took the law of life into my own hands and upset the record and made a far-reaching mess of everything; because you must know you can't live to yourself alone, and if you lay hands on your body, you be upsetting other lives beside your own, and making trouble in the next world so well as this.
<p/>So down I go to the bad place--and very well I should deserve it.
<p/>I can't be sure of Masterman, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>)'ll hardly have the face to treat this rash corpse like a God-fearing creature, I should hope.
<p/>The parish will ring with it if he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Crowner's sitting now over to `The White Thorn,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gollop</b></font>)</div>said Tom's assistant.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and since Jack Head's `pon the jury, there'll be no paltering with truth.
<p/>I hate the man and have little good to say of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a general thing; but there's no nonsense to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s oftener wrong than any chap I know, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't be wrong to-day, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told me nought would shake him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'Tis the feeble-minded fashion to say that them that kill themselves be daft.
<p/>They always bring it in so.
<p/>Why?
<p/>Because the dust shall cheat justice and get so good Christian burial as the best among us.
<p/>But Head won't have that.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)'s all for bringing it in naked suicide without any truckling or hedging.
<p/>The young man was sane as me, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life with malice aforethought; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must lie `pon Chrisomers' Hill with the doubtfuls, not along with the certainties.''

<p/>Poor Mark is thrown over by a girl--not to blame her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), either, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had to be true to herself.
<p/>But still he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) won't believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s not for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s put it plain as you please in writing; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) goes on hoping and dreaming and building castles in the air.

<p/>Then comes the crashing news for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) that all is over and the maiden has taken another man.
<p/>Wasn't it enough to upset such a frail, fanciful creature?
<p/>Enough, and more than enough.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hides his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trouble and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain fails and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart breaks--all unseen by any eye.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) departed and Mr. Gollop walked off to the vicarage.
<p/>A difficult task awaited Nathan, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) courted it in hope of future advantage.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) was terribly concerned for his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) brother and now designed to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>).
<p/>As yet Humphrey had seen nobody.
<p/>Vivian had called at Hawk House the day after Mark's death, but Mrs. Hacker had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) master was out.
<p/>On inquiries as to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) state, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) had merely replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was not ill.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had directed that his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) son's body should remain at the church, and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had not visited Shaugh again or seen the dead since the night that Mark perished.
<p/>Now Nathan, secretly hoping that some better understanding between him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) and Humphrey might arise from this shattering grief, and himself suffering more than any man knew from the shock of it, hastened to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bereaved brother and acquaint him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the circumstances of the inquest.
<p/>Humphrey Baskerville was from home and Nathan, knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) familiar haunt, proceeded to it.
<p/>But first he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) asked Mrs. Hacker how her (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) master fared.
<p/>The woman's eyes were stained with tears and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) nerves unstrung.

<p/>It went out again, I grant you; still it shows the nature of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) could light it.
<p/>Not a word will he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) say about our dear blessed boy--done to death--that's what I call it--by that picture-faced bitch to Undershaugh.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was glad that, at a time when nature has a large voice in the affairs of the individual and sways him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) through sense, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not incurred the customary responsibilities.
<p/>Chance threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>) but a single child; and when the mother of the child was taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>) felt a sort of dreary satisfaction that fate could only strike one more vital blow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>) had dwarfed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>) affections obstinately; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>) had estimated the power of life to inflict further master sorrows, and imagined that by the death of one human creature alone could added suffering come.
<p/>So at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>) believed before the event.
<p/>And now that creature was actually dead.
<p/>Out of the ranks of man, the bullet had found and slain his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son.
<p/>Yet, when Mark sank to the grave and the first storm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) passing was stilled in the father's heart, great new facts and information, until then denied, fell upon Humphrey Baskerville's darkness and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) that even this stroke could not sever his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) spirit from its kind.
<p/>The looked-for deliverance did not descend upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>); the universal indifference did not come.
<p/>Instead his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) unrest persisted and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) found the fabric of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) former dream as baseless as all dreaming.
<p/>Because the alleged saint and the detached philosopher are forms that mask reality; they are poses only possible where the soul suffers from constitutional atrophy or incurred frost-bite.
<p/>They who stand by the wayside and watch, are freezing to death instead of burning healthily away.
<p/>Faulty sentience is not sublime; to be gelded of some natural human instinct is not to stand upon the heights.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) who lifts a barrier between himself and life, shall be found no more than an unfinished thing.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) ambition for detachment is the craving of disease; his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) content is the content of unconsciousness; his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) peace is the peace of the mentally infirm.
<p/>A complete man feels; a complete man suffers with all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tingling senses; a complete man smarts to see the world's negligences, ignorances, brutalities; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) endures them as wrongs to himself; and, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a complete man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too blunders and adds his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) errors to the sum of human tribulation, even while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fights with all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power for the increase of human happiness.
<p/>The world's welfare is his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own; its griefs are also his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) errs and makes atonement; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) achieves and helps others to achieve; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loathes the cloister and loves the hearth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suffers when society is stricken; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mourns when the tide of evolution seems to rest from its eternal task `of pure ablution round earth's human shores'; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is troubled when transitory victories fall to evil or ignorance; in fine, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lives.
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watch-tower and beacon is not content, not peace, but truth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stands as high above the cowardly serenity of any anchorite or chambered thinker, as the star above glimmering and rotten wood in a forest hidden; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows that no great heart is ever passionless, or serene, or emparadised beyond the cry of little hearts, until it has begun to grow cold.
<p/>To be holy to yourself alone is to be nought; a piece of marble makes a better saint; and he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) who quits the arena to look on, though he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) may be as wise as the watching gods, is also as useless.
<p/>Dimly, out of the cloud of misery that fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) when his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) son perished, Baskerville began to perceive and to feel these facts.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had consoled himself by thinking that the only two beings he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) loved in the whole world were gone out of it, and now waited together in eternity for his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) own arrival thither.
<p/>Their battle was ended; and since they were at rest, nothing further remained for him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) to trouble about.
<p/>But the anticipated peace did not appear; no anodyne poured into his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) soul; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) discovered, that for his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) nature, the isolated mental standpoint did not exist.
<p/>There could arise no healing epiphany of mental indifference for him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) might be estranged, but to exile himself was impossible.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) must always actively hate what he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) conceived to be evil; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) must always suspect human motives; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) must always feel the flow and ebb of the human tide.
<p/>Though his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) own rocky heart might be lifted above them, the waves of that sea would tune its substance to throb in sympathy, or fret it to beat with antagonism, so long as it pulsed at all.
<p/>This discovery surprised the man; for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had believed that a radical neutrality to human affairs belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attributed the sustained restlessness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spirit to recent griefs and supposed that the storm would presently disappear; and meantime he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plunged into a minor whirlwind by falling into the bitterest quarrel with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elder brother.
<p/>Nathan indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) had suffered to depart in peace; but as soon as the bereaved father learned that Vivian's son, Ned, was engaged to Cora, and perceived how it was this fact that had finally killed hope in Mark and induced the unhappy weakling to destroy himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) rage burst forth against the master of Cadworthy; and when Vivian called upon the evening of the funeral to condole with Humphrey, an enduring strife sprang up between them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm come as the head of the family, Humphrey,''  (<font color='red'><b>the veteran</b></font>)</div>began the veteran, <div class="bookquote">``and it ban't seemly that this here terrible day should pass over your head without any of your kith and kin speaking to you and comforting you.

<p/>My word!

<p/>That evening Dennis Masterman came to see the farmer, and on the following day he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) called again.
<p/>None knew what passed between them, but it seemed that by some happy inspiration the clergyman achieved what Vivian Baskerville's wife and brother had failed to do.
<p/>Dennis had heard, from the master of `The White Thorn,' that the sick man was passing at enmity with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother and with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strove successfully against this determination and, before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left Cadworthy, Vivian agreed to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) relations.

<p/>Only his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grave stuck in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, and I read over the epitaph till I was weary of it.

<p/>`To think o' me lying there alone among dead folk of evenings, wi' nought but the leather-birds-LSB-1-RSB- squeaking over the graves,' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flickered and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flickered, and wandered in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speech, and the last words I could catch was, `What's all this pucker about?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) runned up the stairs white from the clay-works.
<p/>But there was only more clay on the bed to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>).
<p/>I left 'em at that sacred moment, as my custom is, and went down house, and was just in time to see Humphrey Baskerville ride up in hot haste on his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) one-eyed pony.
<p/>`How is it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)?'
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said, getting off very spry.

<p/>END OF FIRST BOOK     BOOK II    CHAPTER I  Upon the highway between Cadworthy and the border village of Cornwood there stands an ancient granite cross.
<p/>For many years the broken head reposed in the heather; then it was lifted upon the pedestal again and the vanished shaft restored.
<p/>To north and south the white road sweeps by it; easterly tower Penshiel and Pen Beacon, and westerly rolls Shaugh Moor.
<p/>Here, upon a day one year after the death of Vivian Baskerville, there met two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) sons, and the conversation that took place between them served roughly to record the development of their affairs, together with the present situation and future interests of the family.
<p/>Ned Baskerville was riding home from Cornwood, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) brother Rupert, knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) must come this way, sat by St. Rumon's Cross, smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) pipe and waited.
<p/>The younger had found himself forgotten when his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) father's will came to be read.
<p/>It was a pious fiction with Hester Baskerville that her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) husband had striven, when too late, against his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) own hasty deed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) believed that near his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) end the dying man attempted to repair this wrong.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) declared that his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) mutterings both spoke to that effect.
<p/>But the fact of disinheritance was all that remained for Rupert to face, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) bitterness he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) had turned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) family and continued to toil at the china-clay works, despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) mother's entreaties and Ned's handsome propositions.
<p/>Now, however, the case was altered.
<p/>After nine months of this unwisdom, Milly prevailed with Rupert to go back to Cadworthy and take her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) mother was thankful to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) home, and Ned did what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) might to further the prospect.
<p/>Rupert stood within sight of marriage, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) wife were presently to dwell at Cadworthy.
<p/>Then control of the farm would be made over by Ned Baskerville to his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) brother.
<p/>Now Rupert, in working clothes, sat by the cross.
<p/>Opportunity to see Ned was not always easy, for the elder lived a life of pure pleasure and occupied much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) time from home.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) was only concerned to spend money, but showed no interest in the sciences of administering and making it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) rode up presently, stopped, and, bending over, shook hands with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) brother, but did not dismount.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo!
<p/>Don't often see you smoking and taking your ease.
<p/>Look at my new mare.
<p/>Isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) a beauty?
<p/>But Lord knows what Uncle Nathan will say when I come down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) for the cash.
<p/>And I've got another unpleasant surprise in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>).
<p/>I've bought a horse for Cora.
<p/>It'll be my wedding-present to her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) may as well have it now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pity we couldn't have all been married together; then one fuss and flare up and expense would have done for the lot of us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't have minded; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) didn't take to the idea at all.
<p/>Wants to have a first-prize wedding all to herself.
<p/>And about time too.
<p/>I'm sick of waiting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>As a matter of fact Ned had found no difficulty in suspense.
<p/>With possession of money, life's boundaries considerably enlarged for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) became a person of increased importance.
<p/>Cora was not jealous, and finding Ned extremely generous, she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) continued content with the engagement.
<p/>The present year was to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) married, however; but when Nathan Baskerville suggested a triple wedding, Cora objected very strongly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) intended that her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) nuptials should be in a style considerably grander than those of Milly Luscombe, or Polly Baskerville; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) finally promised Ned to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) during the following autumn.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A nice mare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rupert/Rupert Baskerville</b></font>)</div>admitted Rupert; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)'s got a temper, though--won't carry beer.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) very near broke his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the night after Cornwood revel.''

<p/>Well, I'm here to meet you, Ned.
<p/>I want to run over the ground.
<p/>You hate business so bad that 'tis difficult to talk about it with you; but, all the same, as a man with money you must think a bit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Uncle Nathan thinks for me.

<p/>Uncle Nathan, since that bad bout of health last winter, isn't what he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) was.
<p/>Clever enough, I grant; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) has got his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) own affairs, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) own worries too, for that matter.
<p/>Everything be safe and proper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) hands; but suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) fell ill?

<p/>I trust Uncle Nathan like the rest of the world trusts him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>).
<p/>I sign his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) blessed papers and I get my quarter's allowance very regular, with a bit of money over and above when I want it, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) grumbles.
<p/>I ask for no more but to be allowed to enjoy life as long as I can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to do this anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rupert/Rupert Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Rupert.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you my hopes and plans.

<p/>You go in as my tenant at just what rent you please to pay in reason; and you pay me as much over and above the rent as you can afford till the price of the farm is polished off.
<p/>And mother stops with you, and May stops with you.
<p/>Mother has her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) allowance and May has hers, so they'll be no charge on you.
<p/>And I stop too--till I'm married.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all clear, then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and what I'm going to do is this.

<p/>Uncle Nathan's on the look-out for some such a thing for a bit of my money.
<p/>And I hope it will be in Plymouth for choice, because Cora's frightfully keen to be near Plymouth.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wants to make some decent woman pals, naturally.
<p/>It's ridiculous such a girl messing about in a hole like Shaugh.

<p/>The first use of money is to learn the world, Rupert.
<p/>That's where that old fool at Hawk House has messed up his (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) life.
<p/>No better than a miser, that man.
<p/>A spendthrift may be a fool, but a miser always is.
<p/>And so it comes back to the fact that Uncle Humphrey's a fool, as I always said he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) was--a fool and a beast both.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s done it before to-day.
<p/>'Tis in him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) to do kind things, only there's no easy outlet for 'em.

 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Ned galloped off, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) brother, having sat a little longer by St. Rumon's Cross, rose and struck over Shaugh Moor in the direction of Humphrey Baskerville's dwelling.
<p/>The old man was expecting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nephew and came upon the waste to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>They had not spoken together for many days and Rupert was glad to see the elder again.
<p/>A year had stamped its record upon Humphrey Baskerville, and the significance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) son's death might now be perceived.
<p/>Mark's passing left a permanent scar, but the expected callosity of spirit by no means overtook the sufferer.
<p/>Man, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) did not delight him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>), bulked upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) mind as the supreme experience.
<p/>It was an added tribulation that, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) brother's estrangement and death, one of the few living beings with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) enjoyed the least measure of intimacy had dropped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) life.
<p/>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) became increasingly sensitive to the opinion of the people and developed a morbidity that was new.
<p/>Mrs. Hacker was his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) frank intelligencer, and more than once he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) smarted to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) tell how sensible men had spoken ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>).
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) fell into talk with Rupert and uttered the things uppermost in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) mind.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well enough in body, but sometimes I doubt if my brain's all it used to be.
<p/>Mayhap in the head is where I'll go first.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rupert/Rupert Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Rupert laughed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much fear of that, uncle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must know,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the other, <div class="bookquote">``that every man in this life has to suffer a certain amount of injustice.
<p/>From the king on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) throne to the tinker in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) garret, there are thorns stuffed in all pillows.
<p/>Human nature misunderstands itself at every turn, and the closest, life-long friends often catch their secret hearts full of wonder and surprise at each other.
<p/>But I--I've had more than my share of that.
<p/>The injustice that's heaped upon me is insufferable at times.

<p/>They parted, and Humphrey trotted off on his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) pony.
<p/>Meantime at `The White Thorn' a considerable gathering had met to discuss the weddings, and Nathan Baskerville, his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) namesake, the sailor, Heathman Lintern, Joe Voysey, and others enjoyed a morning drink.
<p/>For some the entertainment was now ended, but not a few had been bidden to the feast at Cadworthy, where a double banquet was planned, and many would soon set out on foot or in market-carts for the farm.

<p/>Others came and went; Joe and Thomas matured their Fabian tactics; Nathan Baskerville, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) nephew and young Lintern, set off in a pony trap for Cadworthy.
<p/>The bells still rioted and rang their ceaseless music; for these new-made wives and husbands were being honoured with the long-drawn, melodious thunder of a full five-bell `peal.'
<p/>CHAPTER III  Cora Lintern waited for Ned Baskerville at the fork of the road above Shaugh.
<p/>Here, in the vicarage wall, the stump of a village cross had been planted.
<p/>Round about stitchwort flashed its spring stars, and foxgloves made ready, while to the shattered symbol clung ivy tighter than ever lost sinner seeking sanctuary.
<p/>Upon a stone beneath sat the woman in Sunday finery, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was beautiful despite her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) garments.
<p/>They spoke of untutored taste and a mind ignorantly attracted by the garish and the crude.
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face was fair until examined at near range.
<p/>Then upon the obvious beauty, like beginning of rust in the leaf, there appeared delicate signs of the spirit within.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes spoke unrest and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mouth asperity.
<p/>The shadow of a permanent line connected her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyebrows and promised a network too soon to stretch its web, woven by the spiders of discontent, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) forehead.
<p/>Cora built always upon to-morrow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suffered the fate of those that do so.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was ambitious and vain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) harboured a false perspective in every matter touching her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own welfare, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own desert, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own position in the world.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) largely overrated her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beauty and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) talents.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was satisfied with Ned Baskerville, but had ceased to be enthusiastic about him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/>A year of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) society revealed definite limitations, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) understood that though her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband was well-to-do, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would never be capable.
<p/>The power to earn money did not belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rated his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) windy optimisms and promises at their just value.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) perceived that the will and intellect were hers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew that, once married, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would follow and not lead.
<p/>The advantage of this position outweighed the disadvantages.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) desired to live in a town, and rather favoured the idea of setting up a shop, to be patronised by the local leaders of rank and fashion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loved dress, and believed herself possessed of much natural genius in matters sartorial.
<p/>At present Ned absolutely refused any suggestion of a shop; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doubted not that power rested with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) presently to insist, if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pleased to do so.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) was a generous and fairly devout lover.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) more than satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) requirements in that direction.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had, indeed, cooled his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) ardour a little, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) supposed that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) common-sense was gradually modifying his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) amorous disposition.
<p/>But another's common-sense is a weak weapon against lust, and Ned's sensual energies, dammed by Cora, found secret outlet elsewhere.
<p/>So it came about that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) endured the ordeal of the lengthy engagement without difficulty, and the girl wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) fancied sobriety and self-control as a feather in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cap.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) related her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) achievement to Ned and explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) how much his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) character already owed to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chastening influence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) admitted it without a blush, and solemnly assured her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) whole attitude to the sex.
<p/>Now the man arrived, and they walked together by Beatland Corner, southerly of Shaugh, upon the moor-edge.
<p/>Their talk was of the autumn wedding and the necessity for some active efforts to decide their domicile.
<p/>Cora was for a suburb of Plymouth, but Ned wanted to live in the country outside.
<p/>The shop she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not mention after his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) recent strong expressions of aversion from it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) desired the first step to be such that transition to town might easily follow, when marriage was accomplished and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) power became paramount.
<p/>They decided, at length, to visit certain places that stood between town and country above Plymouth.
<p/>There were Stoke and Mannamead to see.
<p/>A villa was Cora's ambition--a villa and two servants.
<p/>Ned's instincts, on the other hand, led to a small house and a large stable.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) owned some horses and took great part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) pleasure upon them.
<p/>Since possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own steed, however, Cora's regard for riding had diminished.
<p/>It was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way to be quickly satisfied with a new toy.
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) spoke of a `victoria,' so that when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was married she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might drive daily upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shopping and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) visiting.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The thing is to begin well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``People call according to your house, and often the difference between nice blinds and common blinds will decide women whether they'll visit a newcomer or not.
<p/>With my taste you can trust the outside of your home to look all right, Ned.
<p/>At Mannamead I saw the very sort of house I'd like for us to have.
<p/>Such a style, and I couldn't think what 'twas about it till I saw the short blinds was all hung in bright shining brass rods across the windows, and the window-boxes was all painted peacock-blue.
<p/>`I'll have my house just like that!'
<p/>I thought.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you shall--or any colour you please.
<p/>And I'll have my stable smart too, I promise you.
<p/>White tiles all through.
<p/>I shall have to do a bit myself, you know--looking after the horses, I mean--but nobody will know it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll keep a man, of course?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A cheap one.
<p/>Uncle Nathan went into figures with me last week.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) was a bit vague, and I was a bit impatient and soon had enough of it.
<p/>`All I want to know,' I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>), `is just exactly what income I can count upon,' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) said five hundred a year was the outside figure.
<p/>Then, against that, you must set that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>)'s getting a bit old and, of course, being another person's money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>)'s extra cautious.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) admitted that if I sold out some shares and bought others, I could get pretty near another one hundred a year by it.
<p/>But, of course, we've got to take a bite out of the money for furnishing and all the rest of it.
<p/>My idea, as you know, is to invest a bit in a sleeping partnership, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) hasn't found anything of the sort yet, apparently.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>)'s not the man he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) was at finding a bargain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Here opened a good opportunity for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ambitions, and Cora ventured to take it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd think twice about letting me start a little business.
<p/>It's quite a ladylike thing, or I wouldn't offer it, but with my natural cleverness about clothes, and with all the time I've given to the fashions and all that--especially with the hats I can make--it seems a pity not to let me do it.
<p/>You don't want much money to start with, and I should soon draw the custom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Time enough if ever we get hard up.
<p/>I'm not going to have you making money.
<p/>'Tis your business to spend it.
<p/>You'll be a lady, with your own servants and all the rest of it.
<p/>You'll walk about, and pick the flowers in your garden, and pay visits; and if you do have a little trap, you can drive out to the meets sometimes when I go hunting.
<p/>Why, damn it all, Cora, I should have thought you was the last girl who would ever want to do such a thing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``People who keep hat shops often get in with much bigger swells than ever we're likely to know at Mannamead, or Stoke either.
<p/>They come into the shop and they see, of course, I'm a lady, and I explain that I only keep the shop for fun, and then I get to know them.
<p/>I'd make more swell friends in my hat shop than ever you do on your horse out fox-hunting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know a lot of swells, for that matter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask 'em to come to tea and then you'll see if you know 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said.
<p/>'''Tis no use for us to be silly.
<p/>We're poor people, compared to rich ones, and we always shall be, so far as I can see.
<p/>We must be content with getting up the ladder a bit--and that's all I ask or expect.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know my place all right, if that's what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>answered Ned.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not anxious to get in with my betters, for they're not much use to me.
<p/>I'm easily satisfied.
<p/>I want for you to have a good time, and I mean for myself to have a good time.
<p/>You can only live your life once, and a man's a fool to let worry come into his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) life if he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) can escape from it.
<p/>The great thing in the world is to find people who think as you do yourself.
<p/>That's worth a bit of trouble; and when you've found them, stick to them.
<p/>A jolly good motto too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>an acquaintance</b></font>)</div><p/>They spilt words to feeble purpose for another half-hour, and then there came an acquaintance.
<p/>Timothy Waite appeared on his (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) way from Coldstone Farm.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) overtook them and walked beside them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you don't want company,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but I'll leave you half a mile further on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We do want company, and always shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div>declared Cora.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yours most of all, I'm sure.
<p/>We're past the silly spooning stage.
<p/>In fact, we never got into it, did we, Edward?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>betrothed</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) betrothed, <div class="bookquote">``and as you didn't, I couldn't.
<p/>Spooning takes two.''
 (<font color='red'><b>betrothed</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Waite remained a bachelor and no woman had ever been mentioned in connection with him (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) was highly eligible and, indeed, a husband much to be desired.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) enjoyed prosperity, good looks, and a reputation for sense and industry.
<p/>Cora he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) had always admired, and still did so.
<p/>At heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) wondered why she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had chosen Ned Baskerville, and sometimes, since the marriage hung fire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) suspected that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not entirely satisfied of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bargain and might yet change her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) would have married her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) willingly, for there was that in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) practical and unsentimental character which appealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had indeed contemplated proposing when the announcement of young Baskerville's engagement reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) met Cora sometimes and always admired her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) outlook on life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) did so now, yet knowing Ned too, doubted at heart whether the woman had arrested his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) propensities as completely as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asserted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The question on our lips when you came along was where we should set up shop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Ned.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A shop is what I really and truly want to set up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div>declared Cora; <div class="bookquote">``but Edward won't hear of it--more fool him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), I say.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) can't earn money, but that's no reason why I shouldn't try to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Waite entirely agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No reason why you shouldn't.
<p/>If Cadworthy's to be handed over to Rupert and you're going to live in Plymouth, as I hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``then why not business?
<p/>There's nothing against it that I know, and there's nothing like it.
<p/>If I wasn't a farmer, I'd keep a shop.
<p/>For that matter a farmer does keep a shop.
<p/>Only difference that I can see is that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) has fields instead of cupboards and loses good money through the middleman between him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) customers.
<p/>I'm going to take another stall in Plymouth market after Midsummer.
<p/>There's nought like market work for saving cash.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And as nearly half our money will come from the rent that Rupert pays for Cadworthy, we shall be living by a shop in a sense whether you pretend to or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div>added Cora.
<p/>But Ned denied this.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) aired his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) views on political economy, while Waite, who valued money, yet valued making it still more, reduced the other's opinions to their proper fatuity and laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) into the bargain.
<p/>Timothy's contempt for Baskerville was not concealed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) even permitted himself a sly jest or two at the expense of the other's mental endowments; and these thrusts, while unfelt by the victim, stabbed Cora's breast somewhat keenly.
<p/>Even Timothy's laughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) told herself, was more sane and manly than Ned's.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) fell into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) own vice of contrasting the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) had with the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) had not, to the detriment of the former.
<p/>It was an instinct with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) to under-value her (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) own possessions; but the instinct stopped at herself--an unusual circumstance.
<p/>With herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) attributes of mind and body, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) never quarrelled; it was only her (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) environment that by no possibility compared favourably with that of other people.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) mother, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) sister, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) brother, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) betrothed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) prospects--none but seemed really unworthy of Cora when dispassionately judged by herself.
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) weighed Timothy's decision against Ned's doubt, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) knowledge against Ned's ignorance, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) sense against Ned's nonsense.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) felt the farmer's allusions, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) throbbed with discomfort because Ned did not also feel them and retort upon Mr. Waite in like manner.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) told herself that the difference between them was the radical difference between a wise man and a fool.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) fell back in self-defence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) own judgment, and assured herself that, physically, there could be no comparison, and that Ned had a better heart and would make a gentler husband.
<p/>Timothy had admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) remembered that; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) was caution personified and, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) had considered, Ned had plunged.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) strove to see this as a virtue in Ned.
<p/>Yet Timothy's old attitude to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) forbade any slighting of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) remembered very well how, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) congratulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) engagement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) had pointedly praised Ned for one thing alone: his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) precipitation.
<p/>A fault at other seasons may be a virtue in the love season.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) not very clever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Waite/Mr. Waite</b></font>)</div>said Timothy on that occasion; <div class="bookquote">``but now I see he (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) was cleverer than any of us.
<p/>Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) was too clever to waste a moment in getting what every other chap wanted.
<p/>We learn these things too late.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Waite/Mr. Waite</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) said that and said it with great significance.
<p/>It comforted Cora now to remember the circumstance.
<p/>Whatever else Ned might not know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) knew a good deal about women; and that would surely make him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) by so much a better husband.
<p/>Then her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wits told her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) the opposite might be argued from this premise.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was not enjoying herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) felt glad when Waite left them.
<p/>Anon Ned rallied her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) for lengthened taciturnity and even hinted, as a jest, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was regretting her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) choice.
<p/>They turned presently and went back over Shaugh Moor to drink tea at the man's home.
<p/>But upon the threshold Cora changed her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mind.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) pleaded headache and some anxiety about her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) health.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got a cold coming--else I wouldn't be so low-spirited,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll get back through North Wood and go to bed early.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) instantly expressed utmost solicitation and concern.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll come back with you, then.
<p/>If you like, I'll put in the pony and drive you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) said.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would neither of these things.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be all right.
<p/>You go in and have your tea, and don't trouble.
<p/>I'll get back by the wood path, and you'll find I shall be better to-morrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'''Tis that flimsy dress that lets the wind through like a net,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The weather's not right for such clothes as you will wear.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) laughed and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) to mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) own business.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) on the cheek and went away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) stood doubtful.
<p/>First he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) felt moved to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) knew Cora better than she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) did, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) was aware that at the present moment she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) felt perfectly well but desired to be alone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) had not missed the significance of Mr. Waite's views on his (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) sweetheart's mind, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) had failed to appreciate Timothy's sly humour at his (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) own expense.
<p/>Now, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) let Cora have her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) will and made no further effort to overtake her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) waited only until she (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) looked back, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) would; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) hand, turned, and departed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) passed along through the forest homeward, and, when hidden in a silent place, dusted a stone and sat down to think.
<p/>A wild apple tree rose above her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>), half smothered in a great ivy-tod.
<p/>But through the darkness of the parasite, infant sprays of bright young foliage sprang and splashed the gloomy evergreen with verdure.
<p/>Aloft, crowning this gnarled and elbowed crab, burst out a triumphant wreath of pale pink blossom--dainty, diaphanous, and curled.
<p/>Full of light and pearly purity it feathered on the bough, and its tender brightness was splashed with crimson beads of the flower-buds that waited their time and turn to open.
<p/>Higher still, dominating the tree, thrust forth a crooked, naked bough or two.
<p/>They towered, black, dead, and grim above the loveliness of the living thing beneath.
<p/>From reflections not agreeable, this good sight attracted Cora and turned the tide of her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) thoughts.
<p/>Even here the instinct of business dominated any sentiment that might have wakened in another spirit before such beauty.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) gazed at it, then rose and plucked a few sprays of the apple-blossom.
<p/>Next she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) hat and began to try the effect of the natural flowers therein.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) efforts pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) not a little.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord!
<p/>What a hand I have for it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) said aloud.
<p/>Then, refreshened by this evidence of her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) skill, she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) rose and proceeded to Shaugh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know one thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``and that is, man or no man, I shall always be able to make my living single-handed in a town.
<p/>'Tisn't for that I want a husband.
<p/>And be it as `twill, when master Ned finds a lot more money coming in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>)'d very soon give over crying out at a shop.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IV  Humphrey Baskerville still sought to determine his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) need, and sometimes supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had done so.
<p/>More than once he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had contemplated the possibility of peace by flight; then there happened incidents to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) mind.
<p/>Of late the idea of a home further from distracting influences had again seemed good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/>More than once he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) considered the advantages of isolation; more than once he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) rode upon the Moor and distracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) gloom with visions of imaginary dwellings in regions remote.
<p/>The folly of these thoughts often thrust him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) with a rebound into the life of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) fellow-beings, and those who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) best observed a rhythmic alternation in Humphrey.
<p/>After periods of abstention and loneliness would follow some return to a more sociable style of living.
<p/>From a fierce hectic of mind that sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) sore and savage into the heart of the wilderness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) cooled and grew temperate again as the intermittent fever passed.
<p/>And then, when the effort towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) kind had failed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) own ineptitude and the world's mistrust, he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) retreated once more to suffer, and banished himself behind the clouds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) own restless soul.
<p/>Humanity has no leisure to decipher these difficult spirits; the pathos of their attempts must demand a philosophic eye to perceive it; and unless kind chance offers the key, unless opportunity affords an explanation, the lonely but hungry heart passes away unfathomed, sinks to the grave unread and unreconciled.
<p/>Inner darkness turned Baskerville to the Moor again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) rode--where often he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) had already ridden: to inspect the ruin of an old dwelling upon the side of a great hill above the waters of Plym.
<p/>Brilliant summer smiled upon this pilgrimage, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) went, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) fell in with a friend, where Jack Head tramped the high road upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) way to Trowlesworthy.
<p/>Jack now dwelt at Shaugh, but was head man of Saul Luscombe's farm and rabbit warren.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A fine day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey as he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) slowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) pony.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and a finer coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>answered the other.
<p/>Mr. Baskerville was quick to note the militant tone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Been at your silly books again, I warrant,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's one book I could wish you'd read along with t`others, Jack.
<p/>'Tis the salt to all other books, for all you scorn it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bible's a broken reed, master, as you'll live to find out yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Jack.
<p/>'Tis what makes all other writing but a broken reed.

<p/>No man will ever get the whole truth out of the Bible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, by Gor!
<p/>Because it ban't there,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's there all right--hidden for the little children to find it.
<p/>You bandage your eyes and then you say you can't see--a fool's trick that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can see so far as you.
<p/>'Tis you put coloured spectacles on your nose to make things look as you'd have 'em.
<p/>Your book be played out, master.
<p/>Let the childer read it, if you like, along with the other fairy tales; but don't think grown men be going to waste their time with it.
<p/>The whole truth is that the book be built on a lie.
<p/>There never was no Jehovah and never will be.
<p/>Moses invented Him (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) to frighten the folk from their naughtiness, same as you invent a scarecrow to frighten the birds from the seed.
<p/>And the scarecrow works better than Jehovah did, by all accounts.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You talk out of your narrow, bitter books, Jack.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No need to call my books names.
<p/>That's all your side can do.
<p/>Why don't they try to answer 'em instead of blackguarding 'em?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'''Tis a great danger to the poor that they begin to think so much.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you say that.

<p/>'Tis the only weapon for a poor man.
<p/>And what will it soon show 'em?
<p/>It'll show 'em that the most powerful thing on this earth be the poor.
<p/>They are just going to find it out; then you rich people will hear of something that will terrible astonish you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a rank Socialist, Jack.
<p/>I've no patience with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There you are: `no patience!'
<p/>But that's another thing we men of the soil be going to teach you chaps who own the soil.
<p/>`Patience,' you say.
<p/>There's a time coming when the rich people will have to be mighty patient, I warn you!
<p/>And if you're impatient--why, 'tis all one to us, for never was heard that any impatient man could stop the tide flowing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Baskerville grimly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll pay us presently for teaching you, and clothing you, and helping to enlarge your minds.
<p/>When you're learned enough, you'll turn round, like the snake, and bite the hand that fed you.

<p/>Knowledge is poison to low natures, and we ought to have kept you ignorant and harmless.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div><p/>Jack Head stared.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a pretty speech!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a good healthy bit of Christian charity--eh?
<p/>Why for should you ax so much credit for your side?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And look at you now--a prosperous man and saving money.
<p/>Who fed you and taught you and brought you up?
<p/>The State.

<p/>That's how you'd pay your debts.
<p/>You take a base and a narrow view--dishonest too.
<p/>The State have got to look after the rich as well as the poor.
<p/>Why not?
<p/>The poor aren't everybody.
<p/>You're the sort that think no man can be a decent member of society unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was born in a gutter.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Class be damned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Head</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Class is all stuff and nonsense.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And t`other half have got more sense than you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the rider</b></font>)</div>returned the rider.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's summed up in a word.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Another of your silly Christian sayings.

<p/>These things can't be changed.
<p/>And you can't say where any man can reach to; you can't put up a mark and tell your fellow-man, `you shan't go higher than that.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Granted.

<p/>That's not justice but tyranny.
<p/>Give every man his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chance and make every man work--that's all I ask.
<p/>If a man's only got the wits to break stones, then see that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breaks 'em; and let them who can do better and earn better money not grudge the stone-breaker a little over and above what his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) poor wits earn in the market.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I grant that's good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>admitted Baskerville.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let the strong help the weak.

 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div><p/>Humphrey did not immediately reply.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) was following Head's argument to a still larger conclusion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'd argue that as the strong man can help the weak one, so in time the strong State might help the weak one instead of hindering it, and the powerful of the earth give of their abundance to strengthen the humble and feeble?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?
<p/>Instead of that, the great Powers be bristling with fighting men, and all the sinews of the world be wasted on war.
<p/>And it shows the uselessness of the Book, anyway, that the Christian nations--so-called--keep the biggest armies and the largest number of men idle, rotting their bodies and souls away in barracks and battleships.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Baskerville nodded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's sense of a lop-sided sort in much that you say, Jack.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They chattered on and set the world right according to their outlook, instinct, and understanding.
<p/>Then the conversation turned into personal channels, and Mr. Baskerville, while admitting the justice of much that Jack asserted, yet blamed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) for a certain impatience and bitterness.

<p/>The ruin that alternately drew and repelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) lay below; but for the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) did not seek it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) climbed to the high ground, dismounted, turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) pony loose, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) pipe out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>The great cone of granite known as Hen Tor lies high upon the eastern bank of Plym, between that streamlet and the bog-foundered table-land of Shavercombe beyond.
<p/>From its crown the visitor marked Cornwall's coastline far-spreading into the west, and Whitsand Bay reflecting silver morning light along the darker boundaries of earth.
<p/>Spaces of grass and fern extended about the tor, and far below a midget that was a man moved along the edge of the ripe bracken and mowed it down with a scythe.
<p/>Half a dozen carrion crows took wing and flapped with loud croaking away as Humphrey ascended the tor and sat upon its summit.
<p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) traversed the familiar scene in his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) mind, again perceived the difficulties of transit to this place.
<p/>Occasionally, before these problems, he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) had set to work obstinately and sought solutions.
<p/>Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) had determined to rebuild the ruin in the valley, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) might turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) back on man and make trial of the anchorite's isolation and hermit's bastard peace; but to-day he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) was in no mood for such experiments; his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) misanthropic fit passed upon the west wind, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) thoughts took to themselves a brighter colour.
<p/>Where he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) sat two roof-trees were visible, separated by the distant height of Legis Tor.
<p/>Trowlesworthy and Ditsworthy alone appeared, and for the rest the river roamed between them, and flocks and herds wandered upon the hills around.
<p/>The man still moved below, and long ribbons of fallen fern spread regularly behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>A foul smell struck on Baskerville's nostrils, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) saw death not far distant, where the crows had been frightened from their meal.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) climbed away from the main pile of the tor and sat in a natural chair hollowed from the side of an immense block of granite that stands hard by.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) smoked, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) pony grazed.
<p/>A storm of rain fell and passed.
<p/>The sun succeeded upon it, and for a little while the moor glittered with moisture.
<p/>Then the wind dried all again.
<p/>The old man was now entirely out of tune with any thought of a dwelling here.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not even descend the hill and inspect the ruin beneath.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come to spend the day alone, and was contented to do so.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind busied itself with the last thing that a fellow-man had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repeated Jack Head's word over and over to himself.
<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ate the food that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), drank at a spring, and walked about to warm his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body.
<p/>The carrion crows cried in air, soared hither and thither, settled again on the rocks at hand and waited, with the perfect patience of unconscious nature, for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to depart.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remained until the end of the day.
<p/>Then occurred a magnificent spectacle.
<p/>After gold of evening had scattered the Moor and made dark peat and grey rock burn, there rolled up from the south an immense fog, that spread its nacreous sea under the sunset.
<p/>Born of far-off fierce heat upon the ocean, it advanced and enveloped earth, valley by valley, and ridge by ridge.
<p/>Only the highest peaks evaded this flood of vapours, and upon them presently sank the sun.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) light descending touched many points and uplifted sprays of mist; whereon, like magic, a thousand galleons rode over the pearl and advanced in a golden flotilla upon this fleeting sea.
<p/>The rare, brief wonder passed, and the sky above it faded; the sun sank; the fog rolled forward--heavy, cold, a burden for the wet wings of night.
<p/>Humphrey set off, and the carrion crows, full hungry, returned to sup.
<p/>In Baskerville's mind certain words reverberated still, as they had often done since they were spoken during the morning.
<p/>They chimed to the natural sounds that had fallen upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) ear throughout the day; they were echoed in the wind and the distant water-murmur; in the cry of birds and call of beasts; in the steady rasping of his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) pony's teeth through the herbage; and now, in its hoof-beat as it trotted by a sheep-track homeward.
<p/>And louder than all these repetitions of it, louder than the natural music that seemed to utter the words in many voices, there came the drumming of his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) own pulse, laden with the same message, and the answering beat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) heart that affirmed the truth of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A man sitting hungry in a wheat-field, because you don't know and won't learn how to turn corn into bread.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Milly/Milly Luscombe/Luscombe</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER V  Milly and her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) husband Rupert came on a Sunday to drink tea at Hawk House.
<p/>They found Humphrey from home, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) had left a message with Susan Hacker to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) would return before five o'clock.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)'s got the rheumatics,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hacker</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hacker.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have fastened cruel in his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) shoulder-blades, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)'ve started on his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) pony and gone off to see the doctor.
<p/>Won't have none of my cautcheries, though I know what's good for rheumatics well enough, and I've cured three cases to common knowledge that neither doctor nor that Eliza Gollop could budge, do as they would.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rupert/Rupert Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Rupert expressed concern, and went out to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) uncle, while Milly stopped and helped Susan Hacker to prepare tea.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do 'e like being married?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>asked the elder.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; but not quite so well as I thought to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Milly/Milly Luscombe/Luscombe</b></font>)</div>answered Milly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) usual frankness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>same with most, though few have the pluck to confess it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Being married is a very fine thing if you've got such a husband as Rupert; but living along with your husband's people ain't so fine, if you understand me.

<p/>But sometimes his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) mother gets a bit restive at Rupert's orders, and sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says, in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) quiet way, as her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband never would have held with this or that.
<p/>'Tis a thought awkward now and again, because, you see, Rupert ban't the favourite, and never was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Baskerville returned in half an hour, and Rupert walked beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>).
<p/>Then, with some silent suffering, the old man alighted, and a boy took the pony to its stable.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doctor was out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``so I'll have to trouble you to make up a bit of your ointment after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Baskerville was in a hard mood and would allow no credit to the sex.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) endured his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) pain without comment, but it echoed itself in impatient and rather bitter speeches.
<p/>Rupert fell back on other members of the family, and spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) uncle, the master of `The White Thorn.'
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The good that man does isn't guessed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div><p/>Humphrey conceded the nobility of this trait, and Milly spoke.

 (<font color='red'><b>visitors</b></font>)</div><p/>There came an interruption here, and unexpected visitors in the shape of Nicholas Bassett, the young man who had married Polly Baskerville, and Polly herself.
<p/>Nicholas was nervous and stood behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) wife; Polly was also nervous, but the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) brother Rupert gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) courage.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) uncle welcomed her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) with astonishment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wonders never cease,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We came for advice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Polly/Polly Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Polly, <div class="bookquote">``and I made bold to bring Nicholas.

 (<font color='red'><b>Polly/Polly Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Baskerville was gratified, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) nature forbade him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) to show it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A new thing to come to Uncle Humphrey when you might go to Uncle Nathan,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) said.
<p/>'''Tis just about Uncle Nathan is the difficulty,'' declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) niece.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) husband.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak, Nick.
<p/>You must know that Nick's rather slow of speech, and can't get his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) words always, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>)'s improving.
<p/>Tell Uncle Humphrey how 'tis, Nick.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bassett</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bassett nodded, dried a damp brow with a red handkerchief, and spoke.
<p/>'''Tis like this here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassett</b></font>) began.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Under Mr. Vivian Baskerville's will--him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) being my wife's father--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had five hundred pound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I haven't.

<p/>We've had six months' interest on it; but we want the money--at least, half of it--because we've got ideas about leasing a field where we live to Bickleigh, and buying a cow in calf and a lot of poultry.
<p/>With all Polly's farm cleverness we can do better with a bit of money than leave it in the bank.
<p/>At least, that's what we think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Polly husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask Rupert here to help,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>suggested her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) uncle.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had fallen into deep private thought upon this news, and now was only aroused by his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) niece getting up to depart.

 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>The young couple departed in a good deal of agitation, and debated this advice very earnestly all the way home; but Rupert stuck to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) own opinion, and, when they were gone, chode Humphrey for giving such counsel.

<p/>Very different to a woman there.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) tea and aired his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) opinions.
<p/>But Mr. Baskerville was in no mood for Jack's philosophy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) retired presently with Rupert, stripped to the waist, and endured a great and forcible application of Mrs. Hacker's ointment.
<p/>The friction brought comfort with it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) declared himself better as a result.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) did not again descend from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) chamber, and presently the three visitors departed together.
<p/>Mr. Head expressed great admiration for Susan Hacker.

<p/>CHAPTER VI  The setting sun burnt upon Dewerstone's shoulder and beat in a sea of light against the western face of North Wood, until the wind-worn forest edge, taking colour on trunk and bough, glowed heartily.
<p/>Already the first summer splendour was dimmed, for these lofty domains suffered full fret of storm and asperity of season.
<p/>A proleptic instinct, stamped by the centuries, inspired this wood; it anticipated more sheltered neighbours in autumn, though it lagged behind them in spring.
<p/>Upon its boughs the last vernal splendour fluttered into being, and the first autumnal stain was always visible.
<p/>Now beech and larch revealed a shadow in their texture of leaf and needle though August had not passed, for their foliage was born into elemental strife.
<p/>Here homed the west wind, and the salt south storms emptied their vials; here the last snows lingered, and May frost pinched the young green things.
<p/>Now roseal and gracious light penetrated the heart of the wood, warmed its recesses, and dwelt upon a grass-grown track that wound through the midst.
<p/>Toward this path by convergent ways there came a man and woman.
<p/>As yet half a mile separated them, for they had entered the wood at opposite places; but one desire actuated both, and they moved slowly nearer until they met at a tryst in the deep heart of the trees.
<p/>Undergrowth rose about them, and their resort was carefully chosen and perfectly concealed.
<p/>Here oak closely clad the hill, and granite boulders offered an inner rampart against observation.
<p/>The man and woman were elderly, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was still personable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) retained a measure of unusual good looks.
<p/>They came to perform a little rite, sacred and secret, an event celebrated these many years, and unknown to any other human beings but themselves.
<p/>Nathan Baskerville put his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) arms round Priscilla Lintern and drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall never find it this year, I'm much afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The time is past.
<p/>'Tis always later far than other lilies in the garden, but not so late as this.
<p/>However, I'll do my best.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter for the flower,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``so long as we keep up our custom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A slant flame from the sunset stole deliciously through the dusky hiding-places of the wood, and played on the deep mosses and fern-crowns and the tawny motley of the earth, spread like a coverlet beneath.
<p/>Here dead litter of leaf and twig made the covering of the ground, and through it sprang various seedling things, presently to bear their part in the commonwealth and succeed their forefathers.
<p/>The ground was amber-bright where the sunshine won to it, and everywhere stretched ivy and bramble, gleamed the lemon light of malempyre, sparkled green sorrel, and rose dim woodbine that wound its arms around the sapling oaks.
<p/>Wood-rush and wood-sage prospered together, and where water spouted out of the hill there spread green and ruddy mosses, embroidered with foliage of marsh violet and crowned by pallid umbels of angelica.
<p/>The silver of birches flashed hard by, and the rowan's berries already warmed to scarlet.
<p/>Hither after their meeting came the man and woman, and then Nathan, searching sharply, uttered a cry of triumph, and pointed where, at their feet, grew certain dark green twayblade leaves that sprouted from the grass.
<p/>Here dwelt lilies-of-the-valley--their only wild haunt in Devon--and the man now made haste to find a blossom and present it to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistress.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) failed to do so.
<p/>Only a dead spike or two appeared, and presently he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave up the search with some disappointment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They must have bloomed just when I was ill and couldn't come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/>'''Tis no matter at all,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The thought and the meeting here are the good thing.
<p/>We'll go back into the wood now, further from the path.
<p/>To me 'tis marvellous, Nat, to think the crafty world has never guessed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) admitted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And sometimes in my dark moments--however, we can leave that to-day.
<p/>We're near at the end of our labours, so far as the children are concerned.
<p/>Cora was always the most difficult.
<p/>But the future's bright, save for the cash side.
<p/>I hope to God `twill come right afore the wedding; but--''   (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't pretend to be so happy as usual this year.
<p/>Let's face it.
<p/>I know you're worried to death.

<p/>And nothing else matters to us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'm all right, I hope.
<p/>But I'm a bit under the weather.

<p/>I was a fool.
<p/>I won't disguise that; but somehow my luck seemed so good that a few little troubles never looked worth considering.
<p/>Then, just before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) went, I got into a regular thunderstorm.
<p/>It blew up against the steady wind of my good fortune, as thunderstorms will.
<p/>Vivian did me a good turn by dying just when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) did--I can't deny it; and everything is all right now--for all practical purposes.

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) sighed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How it weighs heavier and heavier after all these years!

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll know in good time, and none else.
<p/>When I come to my end, I'm going to tell 'em I'm their father, according to your wish, and because I've promised you on my oath to do it; but none else must ever know it; and it would be a wiser thing, Priscilla, if you could only see it so, that they didn't either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it may be sooner than anybody thinks.
<p/>The position is clear enough: I might have married and still kept the five thousand, because the lawyers said that my dead wife's wish wouldn't hold water in law; but I didn't know that till 'twas too late, and your first child had come.
<p/>Then we talked it out, and you was content and so was I.
<p/>Now there are three of them, and though I'd face the music so brave as you and go to my grave spurned by all men, if necessary, what would better it for them?
<p/>Nothing short of an Act of Parliament would make 'em legitimate now.
<p/>I kept the condition of my dead wife, because you urged me to do it and weren't feared of the consequences; but now, though I can make you my lawful wife, I can't make them my lawful children, and therefore surely 'tis better they shall never know they are my children at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The sun began to sink where Cornwall, like a purple cloud, rose far off against the sky; yet still the undulations of the land, mingling with glory, melted into each other under the sunset, and still North Wood shone above the shadows.
<p/>But a deep darkness began to stretch upwards into it, where the Dewerstone's immense shade was projected across the valley.
<p/>At length only the corner of the forest flashed a final fire; then that, too, vanished, and the benighted trees sighed and shivered and massed themselves into amorphous dimness under the twilight.
<p/>The man and woman stopped together a while longer, and after that their converse ended.
<p/>They caressed and prepared to go back by different ways into the world.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come good or evil, fair weather or foul, may we have a few happy returns yet of this day; and may I live to find you the lily-of-the-valley again once or twice before the end,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/>For answer she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again, but could not trust herself to speak.
<p/>CHAPTER VII  Life is a compromise and a concession.
<p/>According to the measure of our diplomacy, so much shall we win from our fellows; according to our physical endowment, so much will Nature grant.
<p/>All men are envoys to the court of the world, and it depends upon the power behind them whether they are heard and heeded, or slighted and ignored.
<p/>To change the figure, each among us sets up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little shop in the social mart and tries to tempt the buyer; but few are they who expose even necessary wares, and fewer still the contemporary purchasers who know a treasure when they see it.
<p/>An accident now lifted the curtain from Humphrey Baskerville's nature, threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) for a day into the companionship of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) kind, and revealed to passing eyes a gleam of the things hidden within him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/>No conscious effort on his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) part contributed to this illumination, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was incapable of making such.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) curse lay in this: that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) desired to sell, yet lacked wit to win the ear of humanity, or waken interest in any buyer's bosom.
<p/>Yet now the goods he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) offered with such ill grace challenged attention.
<p/>Accident focussed him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) in a crowd; and first the people were constrained to admit his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) presence of mind at a crisis, and then they could not choose but grant the man a heart.
<p/>It happened that on the day before Princetown pony fair Mr. Baskerville's groom fell ill and had to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) bed; but twenty ponies were already at Princetown.
<p/>Only Humphrey and his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) man knew their exact value, and the market promised to be unusually good.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) stock represented several hundred pounds, for Mr. Baskerville bred a special strain possessing the Dartmoor stamina with added qualities of speed and style.
<p/>The irony of chance ordained that one who despised all sport should produce some of the best polo ponies in the West of England.
<p/>Mr. Baskerville saw nothing for it but to sell by deputy at loss, or withdraw his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) stock from the fair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) debated the point with Mrs. Hacker, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) common-sense revealed an alternative.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, man alive, what are you frightened of?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you go up along, like any other chap with summat to sell, and get rid of your beasts yourself?
<p/>You did use to do it thirty year ago, and nobody was any the worse, I believe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go in a crowd like that and barter my things like a huckster?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, why not?
<p/>You'm only made of flesh and bone like t`others.
<p/>You won't melt away.
<p/>'Tis just because you always avoid 'em, that they think you give yourself airs, and reckon they ban't good enough company for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't avoid 'em.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you do.

<p/>And if you'd ope your eyes wider, you'd find a plenty others.

 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div><p/>They started presently, and Humphrey made sour remarks at the expense of Susan's bonnet.
<p/>Then by steep ascent and descent they went their way and fell in with other folk also bound for the festivity.
<p/>Some they passed and some passed them.
<p/>Cora Lintern and Ned Baskerville drove together in a flashy, high-wheeled dog-cart; and the sight of Cora brought a cloud upon Mr. Baskerville.

<p/>None like you for barking; and them as hear you bark take it for granted you bite as well.
<p/>And when I tell 'em you don't bite, they won't believe it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care I never bite you for so much plain speaking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and I'll thank you to lay hold on the reins while we walk up this hill; for I want to read a letter.
<p/>'Tis about the ponies from a would-be buyer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) read and Mrs. Hacker drove.
<p/>They traversed the miles of moorland at a slow pace, and not a few who passed them displayed surprise at the spectacle of Mr. Baskerville on his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) way to the fair.
<p/>At Devil's Bridge, beneath the last long hill into Princetown, a vehicle from Shaugh overtook them and the Linterns appeared.
<p/>Heathman was driving, and beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) sat his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) mother; while at the back of the cart were Nathan Baskerville and Phyllis Lintern.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo!
<p/>Wonders never cease!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the publican</b></font>)</div><p/>cried the publican.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good luck and long life to you, Humphrey!
<p/>Now I couldn't have seen a better sight than this.
<p/>Hold on!
<p/>I want to have a talk afore the fair.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you want to talk, I'll onlight and you do the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>said Nathan's brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The women can drive on, and we'll walk into Princetown.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Priscilla/Priscilla Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Priscilla Lintern and Mrs. Hacker kept their places and drove slowly up the hill side by side; but not before Nat had chaffed Susan and applauded her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) holiday bonnet.
<p/>Heathman and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) sister walked on together; the brothers remained behind.
<p/>The younger was in uproarious mood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) laughed and jested and congratulated Humphrey on his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) courage in thus coming among the people.
<p/>None would have recognised in this jovial spirit that man who walked not long before with a woman in North Wood, and moved heavily under the burdens of sickness and of care.
<p/>But to Nathan belonged the art of dropping life's load occasionally and proceeding awhile in freedom.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) felt physically a little better, and intended to enjoy himself to-day to the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) power.
<p/>Resolutely he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) banished the dark clouds from his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) horizon and let laughter and pleasure possess him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How's your throat?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Humphrey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't look amiss, but they tell me you're not well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope it may mend.
<p/>'Tis up and down with me.
<p/>I can't talk so loud as once I could, and I can't eat easy; but what's the odds as long as I can drink?
<p/>I'm all right, and shall be perfectly well again soon, no doubt.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My ponies.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We ought to be pleased,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the other complacently.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a way, yes.

 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div><p/>Humphrey did not answer and his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) brother spoke again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's only us two left now--you and me.

 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>Nathan's high spirits sank for a little while; then Princetown was reached and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) brother and strove to put this pain from him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) for the present, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) had banished all other sources of tribulation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) was soon shaking hands with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) acquaintance and making merry among many friends.
<p/>But Humphrey proceeded to the place where his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) ponies were stalled, and immediately began to transact business with those who were waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>).
<p/>CHAPTER VIII  Gipsy blood runs thin in England to-day, but a trickle shall be found to survive among the people of the booth and caravan; and glimpses of a veritable Romany spirit may yet be enjoyed at lesser fairs and revels throughout the country.
<p/>By their levity and insolence; by their quick heels and dark faces; by the artist in them; by their love of beauty and of music; by their skill to charm money from the pockets of the slow-thinking folk; and by their nimble wits you shall know them.
<p/>A few mongrels of the race annually find Princetown, and upon days of revel may there be seen at shooting-galleries, `high-fliers,' and `roundabouts.'
<p/>Here they are chaffing the spectators and cajoling pennies from young and old; here, astounding the people by their lack of self-consciousness; here, singing or dancing; here, chafering; here, driving hard bargains for the local ponies; here, changing their doubtful coins for good ones, or raising strife between market-merry folk and prospering from the quarrels of honest men, after the manner of their kind.
<p/>Two streams of holiday-makers drifted through each other and through the little fair.
<p/>They passed up and down the solitary street, loitered and chattered, greeted friends, listened to the din of the music, to the altercations of the customers and salesmen, to the ceaseless laughter of children and whinny of the ponies.
<p/>On either side of that open space spread in the village midst, an array of carts had been drawn up, and against these barricades were tethered various animals which the vehicles had brought.
<p/>They stood or reposed on litter of fern and straw cast down for them.
<p/>Here were pigs, flesh-coloured and black, and great raddled rams in a panting row.
<p/>Amid the brutes tramped farmers and their men.
<p/>The air was full of the smell of live mutton and swine; and among them--drifting, stopping in thoughtful knots, arguing, and laughing heavily, the slow-eyed yokels came and went.
<p/>The rams bleated and dribbled and showed in a dozen ways their hatred of this publicity; the pigs cared not, but exhibited a stoic patience.
<p/>Upon the greensward beside the road stood separate clusters of guarded ponies.
<p/>Old and young they were, gainly and ungainly, white, black, and brown, with their long manes and tails often bleached to a rusty pallor by the wind and sun.
<p/>In agitated groups the little creatures stood.
<p/>Company cried to company with equine language, and the air was full of their squealings, uttered in long-drawn protests or sudden angry explosions.
<p/>Occasionally a new drove from afar would arrive and trot to its place in double and treble ranks--a passing billow of black and bright russet or dull brown, with foam of tossing manes, flash of frightened eyes, and soft thud and thunder of many unshod hoofs.
<p/>The people now came close, now scattered before a pair of uplifted heels where a pony, out of fear, showed temper.
<p/>The exhibits were very unequal.
<p/>Here a prosperous man marshalled a dozen colts; here his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) humbler neighbour could bring but three or four to market.
<p/>Sometimes the group consisted of no more than a mare and foal at foot.
<p/>Round about were children, who from far off had ridden some solitary pony to the fair, and hoped that they might get the appointed price and carry money home to their parents or kinsfolk.
<p/>Hanging close on every side to the main business and thrusting in where space offered for a stall, rows of small booths sprang up; while beyond them on waste land stood the merry-go-rounds, spinning to bray of steam-driven organs, the boxing-tent, the beast show and the arena, where cocoanuts were lifted on posts against a cloth.
<p/>Here worked the wanderers and played their parts with shout and song; but at the heart of the fair more serious merchants stood above their varied wares, and with unequal skill and subtlety won purchasers.
<p/>These men displayed divergent methods, all based on practical experience of human nature.
<p/>A self-assertive and defiant spirit sold braces and leather thongs and buckles.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>merchants</b></font>) art was to pretend the utmost indifference to his (<font color='blue'><b>merchants</b></font>) audience; he (<font color='blue'><b>merchants</b></font>) seemed not to care whether they purchased his (<font color='blue'><b>merchants</b></font>) goods or no, yet let it be clearly understood that none but a fool would miss the opportunities he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) offered.
<p/>A cheap-jack over against the leather-seller relied upon humour and sleight of hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) sold watches that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) asserted to be gold; but he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was also prepared to furnish clocks of baser metal for more modest purses.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) dwelt upon the quality of the goods, and defied his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) audience to find within the width and breadth of the United Kingdom such machinery at such a price.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) explained also very fully that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) proposed to return among them next year, with a special purpose to make good any defective timepieces that might by evil chance lurk unsuspected amid his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) stock.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) reminded them he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had been among them during the previous year also, as a guarantee of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) good faith.
<p/>Beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) a big, brown half-caste sold herb pills and relied upon a pulpit manner for his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) success.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) came with a message of physical salvation from the God of the Christians.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mingled dietetics and dogma; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) prayed openly; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) showed emotion; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) spoke of Nature and the Power above Nature; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) called his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) Maker to witness that nothing but the herbs of the field had gone to make his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) medicine.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had good store of long words with which to comfort rustic ears.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) spoke of 'a palliative,' 'a febrifuge,' and 'a panacea.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wanted but three-pence for each box, and asserted that the blessing of the Lord accompanied his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) physic.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why am I here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who sent me?
<p/>I tell you, men and women, that God sent me.
<p/>We must not carry our light under a bushel.
<p/>We must not hide a secret that will turn a million unhappy men and women into a million happy men and women.
<p/>God gave me this secret, and though I would much sooner be sitting at home in my luxurious surroundings, which have come to me as the result of selling this blessed corrective of all ills of the digestion and alimentary canals, yet--no--this world is no place for idleness and laziness.
<p/>So I am here with my pills, and I shall do my Master's work so long as I have hands to make the medicine and a voice to proclaim it.
<p/>And in Christ's own blessed words I can say that where two or three just persons are gathered together, there am I in the midst of them, my friends--there am I in the midst of them!''
 (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div><p/>Amid the welter of earth-colour, dun and grey there flashed yellow or scarlet, where certain Italian women moved in the crowd.
<p/>They sold trinkets, or offered to tell fortunes with the aid of little green parakeets in cages.
<p/>The blare and grunt of coarse melody persisted; and the people at the booths babbled ceaselessly where they sold their sweetmeats, cakes, and fruit.
<p/>Some were anchored under little awnings; some moved their goods about on wheels with flags fluttering to attract attention.
<p/>Old and young perambulated the maze.
<p/>Every manner of man was gathered here.
<p/>Aged and middle-aged, youthful and young, grey and white, black and brown, bearded and shorn, all came and went together.
<p/>Some passed suspicious and moody; some stood garrulous, genial, sanguine, according to their fortunes or fancied fortunes in the matter of sale and barter.
<p/>And later in the day, by the various roads that stretch north, south, and west from Princetown, droves of ponies began to wend, some with cheerful new masters; many with gloomy owners, who had nothing to show but their trouble for their pains.
<p/>This spacious scene was hemmed in by a rim of sad-coloured waste and ragged hills, while overhead the grey-ribbed sky hung low and shredded mist.
<p/>Humphrey Baskerville had sold his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) ponies in an hour, and was preparing to make a swift departure when accident threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) into the heart of a disturbance and opened the way to significant incidents.
<p/>The old man met Jack Head and was speaking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>), but suddenly Jack caught the other by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shoulders and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) aside just in time to escape being knocked over.
<p/>A dozen over-driven bullocks hurtled past them with sweating flanks and dripping mouths.
<p/>Behind came two drovers, and a brace of barking dogs hung upon the flanks of the weary and frightened cattle.
<p/>Suddenly, as the people parted, a big brute, dazed and maddened by the yelping dogs now at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) throat, now at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heels, turned and dashed into the open gate of a cottage by the way.
<p/>The door of the dwelling stood open and before man or sheepdog had time to turn him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), the reeking bullock had rushed into the house.
<p/>There was a crash within, the agonised yell of a child and the scream of a woman.
<p/>Then rose terrified bellowings from the bullock, where it stood jammed in a passageway with two frantic dogs at its rear.
<p/>A crowd collected, and Mr. Baskerville amazed himself by rushing forward and shouting a direction.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get round, somebody, and ope the back door!''
 (<font color='red'><b>A woman</b></font>)</div><p/>A woman appeared at the cottage window with a screaming and bloody child in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no way out; there's no way out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no door to the garden!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get round; get round!
<p/>Climb over the back wall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>repeated Baskerville.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) turned to the woman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ope the window and come here, you silly fool!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) obeyed, and Humphrey found the injured child was not much hurt, save for a wound on its arm.
<p/>Men soon opened the rear door of the cottage and drove the bullock out of the house; then they turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) round in the garden and drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) back again through the house into the street.
<p/>The hysterical woman regarded Mr. Baskerville as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saviour and refused to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) side.
<p/>The first drover offered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a shilling for the damage and the second stopped to wrangle with Jack Head, who blamed him (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) forcibly.
<p/>'''Twas the dogs' fault--anybody could see that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) declared.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're not to blame.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The dogs can't pay, you silly fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you let loose a dog that don't know his (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) business, you've got to look out for the trouble he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) makes.
<p/>'Tis the devil's own luck for you as that yowling child wasn't killed.
<p/>And now you want to get out of it for nought!
<p/>There's a pound's worth of cloam smashed in there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman, who was alone, sent messengers for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband, but they failed to find him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) declared that Mr. Baskerville should assess the amount of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) claim and the people upheld her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Thus most reluctantly he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was thrust into a sort of prominence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You was the only one with sense to tell 'em what to do; and so you'd better finish your good job and fix the price of the breakages,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div>said Jack.
<p/>The man with the bullocks, when satisfied that Humphrey would be impartial and indifferent to either party, agreed to this proposal, and Mr. Baskerville, quite bewildered by such a sudden notoriety, entered the cottage, calculated the damage done, and soon returned.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got to pay ten shillings,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your bullock upset a tray and smashed a terrible lot of glass and china.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) also broke down four rails of the balusters and broke a lamp that hung over his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) head.
<p/>The doctor will charge a shilling for seeing to the child's arm also.
<p/>So that's the lowest figure in fairness.
<p/>Less it can't be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The drover</b></font>)</div><p/>The drover cursed and swore at this.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was a poor man and would be ruined.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) master would not pay, and if the incident reached headquarters his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) work must certainly be taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/>None offered to help and Humphrey was firm.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Either pay and thank God you're out of it so easily,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``or tell us where you come from.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The drovers talked together, and then they strove to bate the charges brought against them.
<p/>Their victim, now grown calmer, agreed to take seven shillings, but Mr. Baskerville would not hear of this.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) insisted upon observance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) ruling, and the man with the bullocks at length brought out a leather purse and counted from it seven shillings.
<p/>To these his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion added three.
<p/>Then the leader flung the money on the ground, and to accompaniment of laughter and hisses hastened after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stock.
<p/>The cattle were not for Princetown, and soon both men and their cavalcade plodded onward again into the peace and silence of a mist-clad moor.
<p/>They cursed themselves weary, kicked the offending dog and, with a brute instinct to revenge their mishap, smote and bruised the head of the bullock responsible for this misfortune when it stopped to drink at a pool beside the road.
<p/>Humphrey Baskerville won a full measure of applause on this occasion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) took himself off as swiftly as possible afterwards; but words were spoken of approval and appreciation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) could not help hearing them.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) heart grew hot within him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/>A man shouted after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Good for the old Hawk!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had driven off, Nathan Baskerville met him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) at `The Duchy Hotel' and strove to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) drink.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A drop you must have along with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, there's a dozen fellows in the street told me how you handled those drovers.
<p/>You ought to have the Commission of the Peace, that's what you ought to have.
<p/>You're cut out for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A lot of lunatics,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the elder.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No presence of mind in fifty of 'em.
<p/>Nought was done by me.
<p/>The job might have cost a life, but it didn't, so enough's said.
<p/>I won't drink.
<p/>I must get back home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did the ponies go off well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very.
<p/>If you see Susan Hacker, tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) I've gone.
<p/>The old fool's on one of they roundabouts, I expect.
<p/>And if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) breaks it down, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) needn't come back to me for the damages.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A joke!
<p/>A joke from you!
<p/>This is a day of wonders, to be sure!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Nathan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now crown all and come along o' me, and we'll find the rest of the family and the Linterns, and all have a merry-go-round together!''
 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) brother was gone, and Nathan turned and rejoined a party of ram-buyers in the street.
<p/>Elsewhere Mrs. Lintern and Mrs. Baskerville walked together.
<p/>Their hearts were not in the fair, but they spoke of the pending marriage and hoped that a happy union was in store for Ned and Cora.
<p/>The young couple themselves tasted such humble delights as the fair could offer, but Cora's pleasure was represented by the side glances of other girls, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) regarded the gathering as a mere theatre for her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) own display.
<p/>Ned left her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) now and again and then returned.
<p/>Each time he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) came back he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) hat to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) and exhibited some new sign of possession.
<p/>Cora affected great airs and a supercilious play of eyebrow that impressed the other young women.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) condescended to walk round the fair and regarded this perambulation as a triumph, until the man who sold watches marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) among his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) listeners, observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) vanity, and raised a laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) expense.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) temper and declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) wish to depart.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was actually going when there came up Milly and her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) husband, Rupert Baskerville.
<p/>Ned whispered to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) sister-in-law to save the situation if possible, and Milly with some tact and some good fortune managed to do so.
<p/>Cora smoothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) ruffled feathers and joined the rest of the family at the inn.
<p/>There all partook of the special ordinary furnished on this great occasion to the countryside.
<p/>In another quarter Thomas Gollop, Joe Voysey and their friends took pleasure after their fashion.
<p/>Every man won some sort of satisfaction from the fair and held his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) day as well spent.
<p/>Perhaps few could have explained what drew them thither or kept them for many hours wandering up and down, now drinking, now watching the events of the fair, now eating, now drinking again.
<p/>But so the day passed with most among them, and not until evening darkened did the mist thicken into rain and seriously damp the proceedings.
<p/>Humphrey Baskerville, well pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) sales and even better pleased with the trivial incident of the bullock, went his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) way homeward and was glad to be gone.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) state of mind was such that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) gave alms to two mournful men limping slowly on crutches into Princetown.
<p/>Each of these wounded creatures had lost a leg, and one lacked an arm also.
<p/>They dragged along a little barrel-organ that played hymns, and their faces were thin, anxious, hunger-bitten.
<p/>These men stopped Mr. Baskerville, but not to beg.
<p/>They desired to know the distance yet left to traverse before they reached the fair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We set out afore light from Dousland, but we didn't know what a terrible road 'twas,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, with but a pair o' legs between us, we can't travel very fast.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div><p/>Humphrey considered, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) heart being uplifted above its customary level of caution, he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) acted with most unusual impulse and served these maimed musicians in a manner that astounded them.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) only terror was that somebody might mark the deed; but this did not happen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) accomplished his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) charity unseen.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's up this hill,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but the hill's a steep one, and the fair will be half over afore you get there at this gait.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The men shrugged their shoulders and prepared to stump on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Baskerville.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get in, the pair of you, and I'll run you to the top.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) alighted and helped them to lift their organ up behind, while they thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) to the best of their power.
<p/>They talked and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) listened as he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) drove them; and outside the village, on level ground, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) dropped them again and gave them half-a-crown.
<p/>Much heartened and too astonished to display great gratitude, they crawled upon their way while Humphrey turned again.
<p/>The taste of the giving was good to the old man, and its flavour astonished him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) overtook the drovers and their cattle presently, and it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that this company it was who had made the day so remarkable for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) half determined with himself to stop and speak with them and even restore the money he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had exacted; for well he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew the gravity of their loss.
<p/>But, unfortunately for themselves, the twain little guessed what was in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind; they still smarted from their disaster, and when they saw the cause of it they swore at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), shook their fists and threatened to do him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) evil if opportunity offered.
<p/>Whereupon Mr. Baskerville hardened his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) heart, kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) pocket and drove forward.
<p/>CHAPTER IX  The sensitive Cora could endure no shadow of ridicule.
<p/>To laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>) was to anger her (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>) took herself too seriously, the common error of those who do not take their fellow-creatures seriously enough.
<p/>When, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>) committed a stupid error and Ned chaffed her (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>) about it, there sprang up a quarrel between them, and Cora, in her (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>) wounded dignity, even went so far as to talk of postponing marriage.
<p/>Nathan Baskerville explained the complication to a full bar; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had done so the tide of opinion set somewhat against Ned's future bride.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must know that Phyllis Lintern has gone away from home, and last thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) did before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) went was to ask Cora to look after a nice little lot of young ducks that belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) and were coming forward very hopeful.
<p/>Of course, Cora said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) would, and one day, mentioning it to my nephew Rupert's wife, Milly told her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) that the heads of nettles, well chopped up, were splendid food for young ducks.
<p/>Wishful to please Phyllis and bring on the birds, what does Cora do but busy herself for 'em?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) gets the nettle-tops and chops 'em up and gives 'em to the ducklings; and of course the poor wretches all sting their throats and suffocate themselves.
<p/>For why?
<p/>Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) let 'em have the food raw!
<p/>We all know she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) ought to have boiled the nettles.
<p/>And a good few have laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) about it and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) a bit savage.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's no reason, surely, why she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) should quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) sweetheart.
<p/>'Twasn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div>declared Jack Head, who was in the bar.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``None in the world; but Ned joked her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) rather snappy.
<p/>In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) went on a bit too long.
<p/>You can easily overdo a thing like that.
<p/>And none of us like a joke at our expense to be pushed too far.''

<p/>What d'you think she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said?
<p/>`You don't boil thistles for a donkey,' says she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), `so how was anybody to know you boil nettles for a duck?'
<p/>Pretty peart that--eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Voysey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>declared Nathan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very sharp, and a good argument for that matter.
<p/>I've bought Phyllis a dozen new birds and nothing more need come of it; but Ned's a bit of a fool here and there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) hadn't the sense to let well alone; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>)'s turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>)'ll fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) round, a chap so clever with the girls as him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe Voysey/Joe/Voysey</b></font>)</div>said Voysey; whereupon Timothy Waite, who was of the company, laughed scornfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can that man be clever at anything?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own uncle.

<p/>Come now!
<p/>An honest answer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>replied Nathan promptly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) was never known to fall off a horse.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Waite/Mr. Waite</b></font>)</div><p/>The laugh rose against Timothy, for the farmer's various abilities did not extend to horsemanship.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) had been thrown a week before and still went a little lame.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ned's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div>added Jack Head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lazy, no doubt--like everybody else who can be.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop there, Jack!''

<p/>`Gollop,' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, `the roots are being starved.

 (<font color='red'><b>a dozen</b></font>)</div><p/>Half a dozen raised their voices in support of this assertion.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?

<p/>We don't want our ministers to fly in the face of Providence, do we?
<p/>To pray for rain at present be equally mad as to pray for snow.
<p/>'Tis just courting failure.
<p/>Then this here man, Jack Head, and other poisonous members, will laugh, like Elijah when he (<font color='blue'><b>Elijah</b></font>) drawed on them false prophets, and say our Jehovah be asleep.''

<p/>But you're right.

<p/>All the same, Masterman's a better Christian than you.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak as a rank atheist, Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Waite/Mr. Waite</b></font>)</div>said Timothy Waite.

<p/>Faith have had a long run for its money.
<p/>Now we're going to give Works a bit of a show.

<p/>Chosen people!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s been judging us ever since He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made us; now let's judge Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) a bit, and see what His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) games look like to the eyes of a decently taught Board School boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER X  Thanks more to the diplomacy of Nathan Baskerville than Ned's own skill in reconciliation, Cora forgave her (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>) lover and their marriage day was fixed.
<p/>Not a few noticed that the master of `The White Thorn' held this union much to heart, and indeed appeared more interested in its achievement than any other save Ned himself.
<p/>A change had come over Nathan and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) strength failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>).
<p/>The affection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) throat gained upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) voice grew weaker.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) resented allusions to the fact and declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) was well.
<p/>Only his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) doctor and Priscilla Lintern knew the truth; and only she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) understood that much more than physical tribulation was responsible for the innkeeper's feverish activity of mind and unsleeping energy poured forth in secret upon affairs.
<p/>The extent of this immense diligence and devotion was hidden even from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) supposed that a temporary cloud had passed away; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) ceased not, therefore, from begging him (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) to save his (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) powers and so afford himself an opportunity to recover.
<p/>But the man believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) was doomed, and suspected that his (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) life could only be held upon uncertain tenure of months.
<p/>The doctor would not go so far as this gloomy opinion; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did not deny that it might be justified.
<p/>Nathan felt no doubt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) own mind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) believed that Cora's wedding was the last considerable event of a personal and precious nature that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) could hope to see accomplished.
<p/>Afterwards, but not until he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) found himself upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) deathbed, the innkeeper designed a confession.
<p/>Circumstances and justice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) conceived it, must make this avowal private; but those most interested were destined to know the hidden truth concerning themselves.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) had debated the matter with Priscilla, since decision rested with her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) was of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) mind and, indeed, had been the first to suggest this course.
<p/>Cora's shopping roused all the household of Undershaugh to a high pitch of exasperation.
<p/>Much to the girl's surprise her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother produced fifty pounds for a wedding outfit, and the bride employed agreeable days in Plymouth while she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) expended this handsome gift.
<p/>A house had been taken at Plympton.
<p/>The face of it was `genteel' in Cora's estimation; but the back was not.
<p/>However, the rear premises satisfied Ned, and its position with respect to town and country suited them both.
<p/>There remained contracts and settlements, in which Nathan Baskerville represented both parties.
<p/>Ned was generous and indifferent; Cora exhibited interest and a faculty for grasping details.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) told herself that it was only reasonable and wise to do so.
<p/>At any time the reckless Ned might break his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) neck; at any time the amorous Ned might find her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not all-sufficing.
<p/>No sentiment obscured Cora's outlook.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) astounded Nathan Baskerville by the shrewdness of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stipulations.
<p/>Few prophesied much joy of this marriage, and even Priscilla, albeit Nathan was impatient at her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) doubts, none the less entertained misgivings.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) knew the truth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) daughter, and had long since learned the truth concerning young Baskerville.
<p/>Those who desired to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) foretold that man and wife would go each their own way and mind each their own business and pleasure.
<p/>Not the most sanguine pretended to suppose that Ned and Cora would unite in any bonds of close and durable affection.
<p/>The man's mother trusted that Cora's common-sense and practical spirit might serve as a steady strain to curb his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) slothful nature; but May Baskerville was the only living soul who, out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) warm heart and trusting disposition, put faith in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) marriage to lift her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother toward a seemly and steadfast position in the ranks of men.
<p/>At Hawk House the subject of the wedding might not be mentioned.
<p/>In consequence renewed coolness had arisen between the brothers.
<p/>Then came a rumour to Humphrey's ear that Nathan was ill, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) felt concern.
<p/>The old man had no eye to mark physical changes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was slow to discern moods or read the differences of facial expression, begot by mental trouble on the one hand and bodily suffering on the other.
<p/>Now, greatly to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard that Nathan began to be very seriously indisposed.
<p/>The news came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) one morning a month before Cora's wedding.
<p/>Heathman Lintern called upon the subject of a stallion, and mentioned casually that Humphrey's brother had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) voice and might never regain it.
<p/>'''Tis terrible queer in the bar at `The White Thorn' not to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorn</b></font>) and to know we never may no more,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorn</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorn</b></font>)'s gone down and down very gradual; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorn</b></font>) can only whisper.
<p/>'Tis a wisht thing to lose the power of speech--like a living death, you might say.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When did this happen?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It comed gradual, poor chap.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div><p/>Humphrey rose and prepared on the instant to start for Shaugh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must see the man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're out for the minute owing to this wedding.
<p/>But, since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s fallen ill, I must go to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>We'll hope 'tis of no account.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>They set out together and Heathman was mildly surprised to learn the other's ignorance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keeps it so close; but you can't hide your face.
<p/>We've all marked it.
<p/>The beard of the man's grown so white as if the snow had settled on it, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheeks be drawed too.
<p/>For my part I never felt nothing in life to make me go down-daunted afore, except when your son Mark died; but, somehow, Nat Baskerville be a part of the place and the best part.
<p/>I've got a great feeling towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>).
<p/>'Tis making us all very uncomfortable.
<p/>Especially my mother.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) talks to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a lot, feeling how more than common wise she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) be; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knows a lot about him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s terrible down over it and, in fact, 'tis a bad job all round, I'm afraid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div><p/>Humphrey's answer was to quicken his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) pace.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) kept it from me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) replied.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) thought I ought to have seen it for myself.
<p/>Or he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) might have wrongly fancied I didn't care.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody cares--such a wonderful good sort as him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>).
<p/>`Twill cast a gloom over this blessed wedding.
<p/>I wish to God 'twas over and done with--the wedding, I mean--since it's got to be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you wish that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I'm sick of the thing and that awnself-LSB-1-RSB- baggage, my sister.

<p/>Everything's got to go down afore her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), like the grass afore the scythe.
<p/>You may work your fingers to the bone and never get a thank you.
<p/>I had a row with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) last night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) got lashing me with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) tongue till I rose up and fetched her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a damned hard box on the ear, grown woman though she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is.

<p/>`That's better than all the words in the dictionary.

 (<font color='red'><b>subjects</b></font>)</div><p/>They talked on various subjects, and Heathman informed Mr. Baskerville that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) would soon be a great-uncle.

<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) spoke no more, but worked his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) own thoughts into a ferment of jealous bitterness until the village was reached.
<p/>Arrived, he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) took no leave of Heathman, but forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) presence and hastened to the inn.

 (<font color='red'><b>companies</b></font>)</div><p/>They parted, and while one put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) hat and hastened with tremulous excitement to Undershaugh, the other breasted the hill homewards, and buttoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) coat to the wind which sent leaves flying in wild companies at the spinney edge by Beatland Corner.
<p/>The sick man rejoiced upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way; the hale man went moodily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can do no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey to himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)'s a Baskerville, despite the grip of death on him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>).
<p/>Perhaps I was a fool to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) I didn't respect him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'ll think of it again when he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'s got time for thought by night, and `twill rasp home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>Following upon this incident it seemed for a season that Nathan's health mended.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) disease delayed a little upon its progress, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) even hoped in secret that his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) brother might be right and the physicians wrong.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) flashed with a spark of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) old fire.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) whispered jokes that woke noisy laughter.
<p/>In secret he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) ticked off the days that remained before Ned and Cora should be married.
<p/>It wanted less than a fortnight to the event, and all was in readiness for it.
<p/>Humphrey Baskerville had sent Cora twenty pounds, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) had visited him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) personally for his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) goodness.
<p/>The old man had also seen Ned, and although his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nephew heard few compliments and came from the interview in a very indignant frame of mind, yet it was felt to be well that Humphrey had thus openly suffered the past to be obliterated.
<p/>Then came a midnight when Priscilla Lintern, lying awake and full of anxious thoughts, heard upon the silence a sound.
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) believed it to be the four feet of some wandering horse as he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) struck the ground with his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) hoofs in leisurely fashion, and slowly passed along the deserted road; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) perceived that it was the two feet of a man moving briskly and carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) swiftly forward.
<p/>The feet stopped, the outer wicket gate was opened, and some one came to the door.
<p/>Priscilla's window looked forth from a thatched dormer above, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) threw it up and leant out.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) knew by intuition the name of the man below.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that you, Jim?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes'm.
<p/>Master's took cruel bad and can't fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) breath.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) knocked me up, and I went first for Miss Gollop, who was to home luckily.
<p/>Then I comed for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Lintern was already putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) clothes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd best to go back,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be up over at once, after I've waked up my son and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) riding for doctor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Fifteen minutes later Heathman, still half asleep, cantered on a pony through a rainy night for medical help, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother hastened up to `The White Thorn,' and steeled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart for what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might find there.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had long learned to conceal all emotion of spirit, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew that under no possible stress of grief or terror would truth have power to escape the prison of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart.
<p/>CHAPTER XI  The accident of a heavy cold had suddenly aggravated the morbid condition of Nathan Baskerville's throat, and set all doubt of the truth at rest.
<p/>Often on previous occasions he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had anticipated death at short notice, and prepared to face it; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) trusted fate not to deal the final blow before his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) daughter's marriage.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) only concern was to be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) feet again swiftly, that none of the plans for the wedding should be changed.
<p/>The doctor warned him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was very ill, and took the gravest view of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) condition; but Nathan, out of a sanguine heart, declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) would make at least a transient recovery.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) obeyed the medical man's directions very carefully, however; he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) bed and put himself into the hands of the parish nurse.
<p/>In sombre triumph she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) came to this important case, and brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) certain errors of judgment and idiosyncrasies of character that went far to counter-balance real ability begot of experience.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was a good nurse, but an obstinate and foolish woman.
<p/>No more conscientious creature ruled a sick room or obeyed a doctor's mandate; but she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) added to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) prescribed duties certain gratuitous moral ministrations which were not required by science or demanded by reason.
<p/>Mrs. Lintern saw Mr. Baskerville often, and sometimes shared the night watches with Eliza Gollop.
<p/>The latter viewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) attentions to Nathan and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) emotion before his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) suffering with a suspicious eye.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) reserved comment until after the end.
<p/>The case was not likely to be a long one in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) opinion.
<p/>For one week little happened of a definite character, and during that time Nathan Baskerville saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) relations and several of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) more intimate friends.
<p/>Then ensued a malignant change, and at the dawn of this deterioration, after the doctor had left him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), Miss Gollop sat alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) patient and endeavoured to elevate his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) emotions.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've flashed a bit of light on a wandering soul at many a deathbed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) declared; <div class="bookquote">``and I hope I shall be spared to do so at many more.
<p/>There's not a few men and women that wouldn't hear me in health, but they listened, meek as worms, when the end was in sight, and they hadn't strength left to move an eye-lash.
<p/>That's the time to drive truth home, Mr. Baskerville, and I've done it.
<p/>But always cheerful, mind.
<p/>I'm not the sort to give up hoping.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) whispered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wasn't Christ's first and last message hope?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you talk.
<p/>Let me do the talking.
<p/>Yes, 'twas hope He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) brought into this hopeless world.
<p/>But even hope can be trusted too much.
<p/>You must put your hope in the next world now, not in this one, I'm afraid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) say so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) would.
<p/>Death was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) eyes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) went out of your chamber.
<p/>Still, there's plenty of time.
<p/>Things may mend.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)'s going to send a new physic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the good of that if I've got to go?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll know presently, my poor man.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bodily pain's nought.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you haven't--not yet.
<p/>Don't talk about that part.
<p/>You shan't suffer while I'm here--not if I can help it in reason, and under doctor's orders.
<p/>But I won't stray beyond them; I was never known to take anything upon myself, like some of they hospital chits, that call themselves nurses, do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When is Mrs. Lintern coming?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gollop/Eliza/Eliza Gollop</b></font>)</div><p/>Eliza's lips tightened.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very soon, without a doubt; though why, I can't ezacally say.
<p/>Listen to me a little afore she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>)'s here.
<p/>'Tis my duty to say these things to you, and you're not one that ever stood between man or woman and their duty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll not see them married now.
<p/>That's cruel hard after--''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How can you say that?
<p/>You may be there in the spirit, if not in the flesh.
<p/>I suppose you ban't one of they godless ones that say ghosts don't walk?
<p/>Haven't I beheld 'em with these eyes?
<p/>Didn't I go down to Mrs. Wonnacott at Shaugh Bridge in the dimpsy of the evening two year ago; and didn't I see a wishtness coming along out of they claypits there?
<p/>'Tis well known I seed it; and if it weren't the spirit of Abraham Vosper, as worked there for fifty year and then was run over by his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) own team of hosses and fractured to death in five places, whose spirit was it?
<p/>So you may be at your nephew's wedding with the best; and, for my part, I shall know you be there, and feel none the less cheerful for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much to do--so many to save--and no strength and no time--no time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) said.
<p/>The air was dark and hurtling with awful wings for Nathan Baskerville.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) heard and saw the storm coming.
<p/>But others would feel it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was safe from the actual hurricane, but, by anticipation, dreadfully he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) endured it now.
<p/>Death would be no release save from physical disaster.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) place was with the living, not with the dead.
<p/>Cruelly the living must need him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) presently; the dead had no need of him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/>Miss Gollop supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) read her (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) patient's heart.
<p/>'''Tis your own soul you must seek to save, Mr. Baskerville.
<p/>None can save our souls but ourselves.
<p/>And as for time, thanks to the rivers of blood Christ shed, there's always time for a dip in 'em.
<p/>You're well thought on.
<p/>But that's nought.
<p/>'Tis the bird's-eye view the Almighty takes that will decide.
<p/>And our conscience tells us what that view's like to be.
<p/>'Tis a good sign you be shaken about it.
<p/>The best sort generally are.
<p/>I've seen an evil liver go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) doom like a babby dropping asleep off its mother's nipple; and I've seen a pious saint, such as my own father was, get into a terrible tear at the finish, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seed all the devils in hell hotting up against his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) coming.''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ministered to the sick man, then sat down and droned on again.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not listening; his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) strength had nearly gone, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gaiety had vanished for ever.
<p/>Not a smile was left.
<p/>The next world at this juncture looked inexpressibly vain and futile.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cared not a straw about it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was only concerned with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) present environment and the significance of passing from it at this juncture.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Run out--all run out!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) whispered to himself.
<p/>Would there be no final parenthesis of strength to deal with the manifold matters now tumbling to chaos?
<p/>Was the end so near?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brushed aside lesser things and began to think of the one paramount obligation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) come?
<p/>Why don't she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) whispered; but Miss Gollop did not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>This was a sort of moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) felt the call of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) faith mighty upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) had often inopportunely striven to drag a dying's man's mind away from earth to the spectacle of heaven and the immense difficulty of winning it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How many houses have you got, Mr.
<p/>Baskerville?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) asked abruptly; and in a mechanical fashion he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) heard and answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Six--two here and four at Bickleigh; at least, they can't be called mine, I'm afraid, they're all--''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you'd give the lot for one little corner in a heavenly mansion--wouldn't you, Mr.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt--no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk for a bit.
<p/>I'm broken; I'm terrible anxious; I must see--  Give me something to drink, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) Mrs. Lintern came in.
<p/>The doctor, who had perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) tragic interest in the patient, kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) closely informed of his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) condition, and Priscilla had learned within the hour that Nathan was growing worse.
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) came, and Mr. Baskerville asked Miss Gollop to leave them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't think why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gollop/Eliza/Eliza Gollop</b></font>)</div>murmured Eliza.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not generally told to go out except afore relations.
<p/>Still, I can take my walk now instead of this afternoon.
<p/>And if the new physic comes, don't you give him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) none, Mrs. Lintern, please.
<p/>'Tis very powerful and dangerous, and only for skilled hands to handle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div><p/>Neither spoke until the nurse had departed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I shall be gone exactly twenty minutes and no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got my reputation, I believe, if some of us haven't; but with chapel people--''   (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>The exact problem respecting chapel people she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) left unstated, and in closing the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) made some unnecessary noise.
<p/>Then Priscilla folded Nathan in her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) arms and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) hand and shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) eyes while she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) talked; but presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) roused himself and indicated that the confession to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) children must not in safety be longer delayed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't feel particular worse, though I had a bit of a fight for wind last night; but I am worse, and I may soon be a lot worse.
<p/>They'd better all come to-day--this afternoon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) promised.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If that was all--my God, if that was all, Priscilla!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all that matters.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'''Tis the least--the very least of it.
<p/>Dark--dark wherever I turn.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wandered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk, 'tis bad for you.
<p/>If you've got to go, go you must--God pity me without you!
<p/>But you are all right, such a steadfast man as you.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well-meaning, that's all--not well-doing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s gone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't explain what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meant.
<p/>Pray for me to live a bit longer, Priscilla.
<p/>Beg 'em for their prayers at the chapel; beg 'em for their prayers at church.
<p/>I'm terrible, terrible frighted to go just now, and that's truth.
<p/>Frighted for those I leave--for those I leave.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) calmed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and sought to banish his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fears.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entered upon a phase of mental excitement, deepening to frenzy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was bathed in sweat and staring fixedly before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when the nurse returned.
<p/>After noon the man had regained his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nerve and found himself ready for the ordeal.
<p/>A dose of the new drug brought ease and peace.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was astonished and sanguine to feel such comfort.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice from the strain of the morning had almost become extinguished.
<p/>When Priscilla and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children came round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and the family were alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bade the woman speak.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not feared to do it, since you wish them to know, but my throat is dumb.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Heathman stood at the bottom of the bed and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother sat beside it.
<p/>Cora and Phyllis were in chairs by the fire.
<p/>They looked and saw Mrs. Lintern clasp her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) hands over Nathan Baskerville's.
<p/>The act inspired her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) met the astonished glances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) children.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For all these years,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you've been kept without hearing the truth, you three.
<p/>You only knew I was a widow, and that Mr. Baskerville was a widower, and that we were friends always, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) never married again because his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) dead wife didn't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) to.
<p/>But there's more to know.
<p/>After Mrs. Baskerville died, Nathan here found me an orphan girl, working for my living in a china and glass shop at Bath.
<p/>I hadn't a relation or friend in the world, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) got to love me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wanted to marry me.
<p/>But I wouldn't have it, because, in honour to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife's relations, if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'d married me he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'d have had to give up five thousand pound.
<p/>And they would have taken very good care he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did so.
<p/>The law was his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) side, but truth was against it, since his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife gave him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) the money only if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) didn't wed..  She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) couldn't enforce such a thing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) acted as if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could.
<p/>I went to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and you three children were born.
<p/>Then, a bit after, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) came back here, and of course I came with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s your father, but there's no call for any else to know it but us.
<p/>I don't care, and never shall care if everybody knows it.
<p/>A better man won't breathe God's air in this world than your father, and no woman have been blessed with a kinder husband in the eye of the Almighty.
<p/>But there's you three to think of, and `twould be against you if this was known now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) didn't even want to tell you; but I was determined that you should know it afore either of us died.
<p/>And now it's pleased God to shorten your dear father's days; and you've got to hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is your father.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a silence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ask them to forgive me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div>whispered Nathan Baskerville.

<p/>Mrs. Lintern shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) pillow and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) hand again.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) son, who stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) mouth open, staring at the sick man.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) expression indicated no dismay, but immense astonishment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm damned!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This beats cock-fighting!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why--good God!--I will for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the man.

<p/>I'll call him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father, and welcome, and I wish to Christ he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) wasn't going to die.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Heathman came and took Nathan's hand, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) mother broke down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) words, buried her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face in the counterpane and wept.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell them to come over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>whispered Mr. Baskerville to his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) son.

<p/>The girls came, and first Phyllis kissed Nathan nervously, and then the touch that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) hungered for rested a moment on his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) cheek.
<p/>With Cora's kiss the tension subsided; he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) sank back, and Priscilla drew the sheet up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) beard, and again lifted the pillow.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I shall go in some sort of peace, though an erring and a sinful man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) murmured.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you can forgive me, so will my Saviour.

<p/>No need to tell anybody the truth.
<p/>Forgive your father, and forget him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so soon as ever you can; but worship your mother always--to your dying day worship her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); protect her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and shield her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and stand between her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and the rough wind, and be proud of having such a blessed brave woman for a mother.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The time's coming when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will need all the love and wit you've got among you.

<p/>All I say is, forgive me, and love your mother through thick and thin.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand out to Cora.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was sitting on the edge of the bed looking out of the window.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll remember, my Cora,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd best all to go now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Priscilla/Priscilla Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div>declared Priscilla.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) rose and looked straight into the eyes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) children each in turn.
<p/>The girls flinched; the son went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think this will make any difference to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div>said Heathman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a damned sight too good a mother for me, whether or no--or for them women either; and this man here--our father, I should say--needn't worrit about you, for I'll always put you afore anything else in the world.''

<p/>We're above such small things, but many people would cold shoulder us if they heard of it.
<p/>You know what people are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) without love.
<p/>The girl was excited; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began to appreciate the significance of what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had heard; her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes were wet and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice shook.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be `quiet and sensible,' Cora Lintern,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been `quiet and sensible' for a good many years, I believe, and I shan't begin to be noisy and foolish now.
<p/>You're quite safe.
<p/>Better you all go away now and leave us for the present.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/>They departed silently, and, once below, the girls crept off together, like guilty things, to their home, while Lintern dallied in the bar below and drank.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) was perfectly indifferent to the serious side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) discovery, and, save for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) mother's sake, would have liked to tell the men in the bar all about it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) regarded it rather as a matter of congratulation than not.
<p/>No spark of mercenary feeling touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) emotion.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) was a rich man's son had not yet occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); but that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was a good man's son and a popular man's son pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>Mrs. Lintern suffered no detraction in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) felt wonder when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) power of hiding this secret for so many years, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) experienced honest sorrow for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) that the long clandestine union was now to end.
<p/>The day's event, indeed, merely added fuel to the flame of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>).
<p/>But it was otherwise with the sisters.
<p/>Phyllis usually took on the colour of Cora's thought, and now the elder, with no little perspicacity, examined the situation from every point of view.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The only really bright side it's got is that there'll be plenty of money, I suppose.
<p/>I'd give a sovereign, Phyllis, to see the will.
<p/>Father--how funny it sounds to say it--poor father was always terrible fond of me, and I've often wondered why for.
<p/>Now, of course, 'tis easy to explain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about the wedding?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Phyllis/Phyllis Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Phyllis.
<p/>''`Twill have to be cruel quiet now, I suppose.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) sister.
<p/>''`Twill have to be put off, that's all.
<p/>I won't have a scrubbly little wedding smothered up in half mourning, or some such thing; but, come to think of it, we shan't figure among the mourners in any case--though we shall be among them really.
<p/>`Twill be terrible difficult to help giving ourselves away over this.
<p/>I think the best thing would be for mother to take the money and clear out, and go and live somewhere else--the further off the better.
<p/>For that matter, when the will's read, everybody will guess how it is.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heathman might go on with the public-house.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) might.

<p/>I shan't be sorry to change my name now, Phyllis.
<p/>And the sooner you cease to be called Lintern, too, the better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About mother?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not a fool, and I'm not going to trouble myself about the things that other people do; but all the same, I shall be glad to get out of it and start with a clean slate among a different class of people.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What amazing cleverness to hide it all their lives like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phyllis/Phyllis Lintern</b></font>)</div>speculated Phyllis.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure us never would have been so clever as to do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It became a habit, no doubt.
<p/>'Twas salt to their lives, I reckon, and made 'em all the fonder of each other,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div>declared Cora.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everyday married life must have looked terrible tame to them--doing what they did.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm awful sorry for mother now, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phyllis/Phyllis Lintern</b></font>)</div>continued Phyllis; <div class="bookquote">``because when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) dies she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) can't put on weeds and go and hear the funeral sermon, and do all the things a proper widow does do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Phyllis/Phyllis Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>admitted her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) sister; <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) certainly can't.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)'ll have to hide the truth pretty close from this day forward, that's very clear.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) owes that to me--and to you; and I shall see she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) pays her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) debt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) will, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)'s a terrible brave woman, and always has been.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)'ll hide it up close enough--so close as we shall, for that matter.

<p/>You know what a careless creature he (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Cora frowned.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I know there's no love lost between him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) and me.
<p/>A coarse man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, and don't care what gutter he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chooses his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends out of.
<p/>Take one thing with another, it might be so well to marry Ned at the appointed time, and get it hard and fast.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So they talked, and misprized Heathman from the frosty standpoint of their own hearts.
<p/>Rather than bring one shadow on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) mother's fame, the brother of these girls would have bitten out his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) tongue and swallowed it.
<p/>CHAPTER XII  Nathan Baskerville's bedroom faced the south.
<p/>A text was nailed upon the wall over his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) head, and an old photograph of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) father stood upon the mantelpiece.
<p/>To right and left of this memorial appeared trinkets made of shells.
<p/>A pair of old carriage lamps, precious from association, decorated either end of the mantelshelf.
<p/>An old print of Niagara Falls, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) mother had valued, was nailed above it.
<p/>A white curtain covered the window, but there was no blind, for this man always welcomed daylight.
<p/>On the window-ledge there languished a cactus in a pot.
<p/>It was a gift under the will of an old dead woman who had tended it and cherished it for twenty years.
<p/>One easy chair stood beside the bed, and on a table at hand were food and medicine.
<p/>Many came to see the dying man, and Humphrey Baskerville visited him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) twice or thrice in every week.
<p/>More than once Nathan had desired to speak of private matters to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) brother, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) lacked the courage, and soon all inclination to discuss mundane affairs departed from him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>).
<p/>There followed a feverish week, in which Nathan only desired to listen to religious conversation.
<p/>Recorded promises of hope for the sinner were his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) penultimate interest on earth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) made use of a strange expression very often, and desired again and again to hear the Bible narrative that embraced it.
<p/>''`This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise,''' he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) said to Humphrey and to many others.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cling to that.
<p/>It was spoken to a thief and a failure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>All strove to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>), but a great mental incubus haunted his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) declining hours.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) old sanguine character seemed entirely to have perished; and its place was taken by spirits of darkness and of terror.
<p/>''`The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,''' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) said to Eliza Gollop, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) was alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I'd marked that better, I might now have got beyond that stage and learned to love Him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>).
<p/>But I'm in fear--my life hasn't took me further than that--all's fearful still.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No need in your case, I hope, so far as mortal man can say,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) answered.
<p/>'''Tis natural to be uneasy when the journey's end falls in sight; and we all ought to be.
<p/>But then comes Christ and casts out fear.
<p/>You've a right, so far as man can say, to trust Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and fear nought.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But man doesn't know.
<p/>Yet He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forgave the dying thief.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did so, though us have no right to say whether 'twas a bit of rare kindness in Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made a practice of it.
<p/>But for my part I steadfastly believe that He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do forgive everything but the sin against the Holy Ghost.
<p/>Of course, that's beyond His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power, and would never do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Lintern spent much time at `The White Thorn,' and since her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) visits relieved Eliza of work, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) acquiesced in them, while reserving the right of private judgment.
<p/>Priscilla and her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) children all saw the sufferer together more than once; and then came a day when Heathman, Cora, and Phyllis took their leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>).
<p/>The young man then secreted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) emotion and roamed for an hour alone upon the Moor; the girls felt it but little.
<p/>Cora declared afterwards to Phyllis that since this great confession had been made, her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) mind dimly remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) tender youth and a man in it.
<p/>This man she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) had regarded as her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) father.
<p/>All the children were deceived at an early age.
<p/>They had, indeed, been led implicitly to suppose that their father died soon after the birth of Phyllis.
<p/>One last conversation with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brother, Humphrey long remembered.
<p/>It was the final occasion on which Nathan seemed acutely conscious, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) uneasiness of mind clearly appeared.
<p/>They were alone, and the elder perceived that Nathan desired and yet feared to make some statement of a personal character.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) might ease the other's mind and open the way to any special conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) desired, Mr. Baskerville uttered certain general speeches concerning their past, their parents, and the different characteristics of temperament that had belonged to Vivian and themselves.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We were all as opposite as men can be, and looked at life opposite, and set ourselves to win opposite good from it.
<p/>Who shall say which comes out best?
<p/>On the whole, perhaps Vivian did.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) died without a doubt.
<p/>There are some men bound to be pretty happy through native stupidity and the lack of power to feel; and there are some men--mighty few--rise as high as happiness, and glimpse content by the riches of their native wisdom.
<p/>I've found the real fools and the real wise men both seem to be happy.
<p/>A small brain keeps a man cheerful as a bird, and a big one leads to what's higher than cheerfulness; but 'tis the middle bulk of us be so often miserable.
<p/>We'm too witty to feed on the fool's pap of ignorance; and not witty enough to know the top of wisdom.
<p/>I speak for myself in that; but you've been a happy, hopeful man all your days; so belike, after all, you're wiser than I granted you to be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me wise!
<p/>My God!
<p/>Don't you say that.
<p/>My happiness was a fool's happiness; my laughter a fool's laughter all the time.
<p/>At least--not all the time; but at first.
<p/>We do the mad things at the mad age, and after, when the bill comes in--to find us grown up and in our right minds--we curse Nature for not giving us the brains first and the powers afterwards.
<p/>Man's days be a cruel knife in the hand of a child.
<p/>Too often the heedless wretch cuts hisself afore he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>)'s learned how to handle it, and carries the scar for ever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True for you.

<p/>We know it; but who stands up between a young man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) youth to protect him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) therefrom?
<p/>We old blids see 'em thinking the same vain things, and doing the same vain things, and burning their fingers and scorching their hearts at the same vain fires; and we look on and grin, like the idiots we are, and make no effort to help 'em.
<p/>Not you, though--not you.
<p/>You was always the young man's friend.
<p/>You never was a young man yourself exactly.
<p/>An old head on young shoulders you always carried; and so did I.''

<p/>'Tisn't so.
<p/>No man was madder than me; none was crueller; none committed worse sins for others' backs to bear.
<p/>The best that any man will be able to say of me a month after I'm in my grave is that I meant well.
<p/>And maybe not many will even say that.
<p/>Death's no evil to me, Humphrey, but dying now is a very cruel evil, I assure you.
<p/>The cloud lies behind, not in front.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it does with every man struck down in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work.
<p/>Shall you write your own verse according to our old custom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The other shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.
<p/>I'll stick up no pious thought for men to spit upon when they pass my grave.
<p/>I'd rather that no stone marked it.
<p/>`Twill be remembered--in one heart--and that's more than ever I'll deserve.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be downcast.
<p/>Leave afterwards to me.
<p/>I think better of you for hearing you talk like this.

<p/>You don't fear the thing, and that's to the good.
<p/>But, like all busy men, it finds you with a lot of threads tangled, I suppose.
<p/>That's the fate of every one who tries to do other people's work besides his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own, and takes off the shoulders of others what properly belongs there.
<p/>They'll have to look to their own affairs all round when you go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>Nathan's answer was a groan, and with the return of the nurse, Humphrey went away.
<p/>From that hour the final phases of the illness began; suffering dimmed the patient's mind, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) thoughts away from everything but his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) own physical struggle between the intervals of sleep.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) torments increased; his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) consciousness, flinging over all else, was reduced to its last earthly interest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) attention ceaselessly fixed upon one thing so long as his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) mind continued under his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) control.
<p/>Not grief at the past; not concern at the future; not the face of Priscilla, and not the touch of her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) hand absorbed his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) intelligence now; but the sight of a small bottle that held the anodyne to his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) misery.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) steadfastly regarded, and pointed impatiently to the clock upon the mantelpiece when the blessed hour of administration struck.
<p/>The medicine was guarded jealously by Eliza Gollop, and once, when frenzied at the man's sufferings, Priscilla had sought to administer a dose, the other woman came between and sharply rebuked her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's death!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) whispered under her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``D'you want to murder him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s taking just what the doctor allows--the utmost limit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>After three days of unutterable grief, Nathan's brother became aware of the situation, and perceived that the end tarried.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) debated on this long-drawn horror for a night, and next day spoke to the doctor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) put the case without evasion or obscurity, and the professional man heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in patience and explained at once his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deep sympathy and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) utter powerlessness to do more.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s dying--you grant that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s dying--the quicker the better now, poor fellow.
<p/>The glands are involved, and the end must come tolerably soon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible to say.
<p/>A few days probably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you help him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) out of it, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?
<p/>You'd do as much for a horse or dog.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My business is to prolong life, not hasten death.

 (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The doctor reflected.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was experienced and efficient; but like many other professional men, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had refused his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) reason any entrance into the arcanum of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) religious opinions.
<p/>These were of the customary nebulous character, based on tradition, on convention, on the necessity for pleasing all in a general practice, on the murmur of a mother's voice in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) childhood.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a Christian,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I think it wrong to lessen by one moment the appointed life of any man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But not wrong to lengthen it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That we cannot do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then surely you cannot shorten it, either?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not argue about it.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.
<p/>I am diminishing his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) pain enormously.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) never shortened any man's days; He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) prolonged them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm answered,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the elder.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your conscience is--where it should be: on the side of the law.

 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div><p/>They parted, and Humphrey found the other's argument not strong enough to satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) wrestled with the problem for some time and ere long his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) impression grew into a conviction, his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) conviction ripened to a resolve.
<p/>In the afternoon of that day he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) returned to `The White Thorn' and found Mrs. Lintern with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorn</b></font>) brother.
<p/>Eliza had gone out for a while.
<p/>Nathan appeared to be half unconscious, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) mind clearly pursued some private train of thought.
<p/>Priscilla rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) chair beside the bed and shook hands with Humphrey.
<p/>Nathan spoke, but not to them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A mighty man of valour.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) burning words melted the wax in a man's ears, I warn you....  Melted the wax in a man's ears....  Melted the wax....  Oh, Christ, help me!
<p/>Isn't it time for the medicine yet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) stared at the bottle.
<p/>It was placed on a bracket in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) sight.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did the doctor say to-day?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Humphrey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Said it was wonderful--the strength.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My God, no!
<p/>I'd--I'd do all a woman could do to end it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div><p/>Humphrey regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) searchingly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) consciousness again?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I asked the doctor the same question.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) might, but it was doubtful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The sick man groaned.
<p/>Agony had long stamped its impress on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to have the medicine?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When Miss Gollop comes back,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) said.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it may be a lifetime to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)--a whole lifetime of torment yet before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>admitted Humphrey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I pray to God day and night to take him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Baskerville knelt beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) brother, spoke loudly, squeezed the sufferer's hand and tried to rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My physic, Eliza, for your humanity, Eliza--the clock's struck--I heard it--I swear--oh, my merciful Maker, why can't I have it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) writhed in slow suffocation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) medicine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This shan't go on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>)'ll make trouble if you do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not, and it's no great matter if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) does.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) crossed the room, examined the bottle, took it to the light and poured out rather more than a double dose.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) crossed the room with it, heaved a long breath, steadied himself and then put his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) arm round his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) brother and lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here you are, Nat.
<p/>You'll sleep awhile after this.
<p/>`Twill soon ease you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>Nathan Baskerville seized the glass like one perishing of thirst, and drank eagerly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) continued to talk a little afterwards, but was swiftly easier.
<p/>Presently the drug silenced him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) lay still.
<p/>Humphrey looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) watch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you'll understand.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) won't have another pang.
<p/>I've taken it upon myself.
<p/>You're a wise and patient woman.
<p/>You've got other secrets.
<p/>Better keep this with the rest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) was excited.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) forehead grew wet and he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) mopped it with the sheet of the bed.
<p/>Priscilla did not reply; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) went on her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) knees beside Nathan and listened.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At six o'clock, or maybe a bit earlier, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>)'ll stop.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After four.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll wait then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a brave man.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do as you would be done by covers it.
<p/>'Tis a disgrace to the living that dying men should suffer worse terror and pain than dying beasts.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rose then and fetched a chair.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) held Nathan's hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) was insensible and breathing faintly but easily.
<p/>Suddenly Mrs. Lintern got up and hastened across the room to the medicine bottle.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must think of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) read it in my eyes, I believe.

 (<font color='red'><b>Priscilla/Priscilla Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Priscilla took the bottle, lifted it and let it fall upon the floor.
<p/>It broke, and the medicine was spilled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will answer the purpose.

<p/>Then you won't be suspected.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) listened, and perceived how easily came the devious thought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) swift mind.
<p/>It did not astonish him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) was skilled in the art to deceive.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've taken the chances--all of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've thought long about this.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)'ll know by the peace of poor Nat here how it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Priscilla/Priscilla Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Priscilla looked again.
<p/>Profound calm brooded over the busy man of Shaugh Prior.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sinking out of life without one tremor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's an awful side to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman murmured.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The awfulness was to see Nature strangling him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by inches.

<p/>'Tis meant to be an awful thing to the living--not to the dying.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>For half an hour they sat silent.
<p/>Then Priscilla lifted the clothes and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) hand to Nathan's feet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>)'s cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) said.

 (<font color='red'><b>Gollop/Eliza/Eliza Gollop</b></font>)</div><p/>A little later Eliza Gollop returned.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) came at the exact hour for administration of the medicine, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) sought the bottle before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) bonnet and cloak.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where--why--?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) cried out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) physic a bit ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Baskerville.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The bottle is broke.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The nurse</b></font>)</div><p/>The nurse hurried to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) patient and examined him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) closely.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) perceived the change.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)'s dying!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said.

<p/>I--oh, you wicked woman!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned upon Mrs. Lintern and poured out a torrent of invective.
<p/>Then Humphrey took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by the shoulders and put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) out of the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll not be wanted any more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hastened from the inn and then went off to the vicarage as fast as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) legs would carry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Another half-hour passed and none came to them.
<p/>From time to time Priscilla put her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) ear to Nathan's face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>)'s breathing any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) said.
<p/>Then came a noise and a grumbling of men's voices below.
<p/>A violent strife of words clashed in the bar.
<p/>The day had waned and it was growing dark.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll be against you, I'm fearing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Priscilla/Priscilla Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div>said Priscilla.
<p/>'''Tis of no account.
<p/>They always are.''
<p/>Presently Dennis Masterman entered the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear poor Baskerville is going and they can't find his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) minister.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) was leaning over his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) brother.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) watch, opened it, and put the polished inner case to Nathan's lips.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Light a candle and bring it here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) said to Priscilla.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) obeyed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) examined the polished metal.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No stain--he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>)'s dead, I suppose.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mr. Baskerville turned to the clergyman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you can pray, I'll be glad for you to do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div><p/>Dennis immediately knelt down; the old man also went slowly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dennis</b></font>) knees and the weeping woman did the same.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Almighty God, Who has been pleased to take our brother from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sufferings and liberate an immortal soul from mortal clay, be Thou beside him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) now, that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) may pass over the dark river with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) Saviour's, and enter as a good and faithful servant into the joy of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) Lord.

<p/>Let us walk in the way that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) walked, and pass in peace at the end as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has passed.
<p/>And this we beg for the sake of our Mediator and Comforter, our Blessed Lord and Redeemer, Thy Son, Jesus Christ.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Amen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Baskerville, <div class="bookquote">``and thank you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) rose, cast one glance at the grief-stricken woman by the bed, then looked upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) brother and then prepared to depart.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) returned for a moment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you do the rest?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) asked of Mrs. Lintern.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or shall I tell 'em to send?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I daren't.
<p/>Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) to send.
<p/>I must go home,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) answered.
<p/>A loud noise persisted in the bar, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) did not enter it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) hat and an old umbrella from the corner of the sick-room, then descended and went out into the night.
<p/>CHAPTER XIII  The doctor who attended Nathan Baskerville in his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) last illness heard from Eliza Gollop what had been done, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) took a serious view of it.
<p/>From the standpoint of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) opinions Humphrey Baskerville had struck a blow at society and the established order.
<p/>The physician was sober-minded and earnest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) communicated with the coroner of the district, stated the case impartially and left the official to act as seemed proper to him (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>).
<p/>But the coroner was also a medical man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) reduced the problem to its simplest possible dimensions.
<p/>Death had been hastened by an uncertain measure of time for one who was enduring extreme agony.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) judged the case on its own merits, after a rare judicial faculty peculiar to himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) made no effort to consider its general bearing and tendency; he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) did not enlarge his (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) survey to the principles involved.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) sympathy was entirely on the side of Humphrey Baskerville; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) applauded the old man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) heart and declared no inquest necessary.
<p/>None was therefore held.
<p/>Those interested in Nathan's end took opposite views, and as for Humphrey himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) was hidden for a time from the people and did not appear again in public until his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) brother's funeral.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) failed, therefore, to learn the public opinion.
<p/>Jack Head and those who thought as he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) did, upheld the action; but not a few shared the faith of Thomas Gollop, openly expressed at the bar of `The White Thorn' while still the dead master lay above.
<p/>For two days Nathan kept a sort of humble state, and the folk from far and near enjoyed the spectacle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) corpse.
<p/>Many tramped ten miles to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>).
<p/>The humblest people appeared; the most unexpected persons acknowledged debts of unrecorded kindness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) coffin with a face placid and small behind the bush of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) silver beard.
<p/>Women wept at the sight and took a morbid joy in touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) folded hands.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) was hidden for ever and carried with difficulty down the narrow and winding stair of the inn.
<p/>Thomas Gollop dug the grave and Joe Voysey helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>).
<p/>No younger men assisted them.
<p/>They felt a sort of sentiment in the matter.
<p/>'''Tis the last pit I shall open, Joe,'' said Mr. Gollop; <div class="bookquote">``and for my part, if I had my way, I shouldn't make it very deep.
<p/>In these cases the law, though slow, is sure, and it may come about that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>)'ll have to be digged up again inside a month to prove murder against that dark, awful man to Hawk House.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gollop/Gollop</b></font>)</div><p/>'''Tis the point of view.
<p/>I don't look at it quite the same.
<p/>For my part, in my business, I see a lot of death--not men but plants.
<p/>And when a bush or what not be going home, I don't stand in the way.
<p/>`No good tinkering,' I often says to Miss Masterman, for the silly woman seems to think a gardener can stand between a plant and death.
<p/>`The herb be going home,' I says, `and us can't stay the appointed time.'
<p/>`But I don't want it to go home--it mustn't go home,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>)'ll answer me--like a silly child talking.
<p/>However, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) back be turned, I do my duty.
<p/>The bonfire's the place.
<p/>Jack Head looked over the kitchen-garden wall a bit agone and seed me firing up; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) said, `Ah, Joe, your bonfire's like charity: it covers a multitude of sins!'
<p/>A biting tongue that man hath!''
<p/>Joe chuckled at the recollection, but Gollop was not amused.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A plant and a man are very different,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scripture tells us that the fire is the place for the withered branch, but where there's a soul working out its salvation in fear and trembling, who be we worms to stand up and say `go'?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It might be the Lord put it in Mr. Baskerville's heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe Voysey/Joe/Voysey</b></font>)</div>argued Voysey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Lord ban't in the habit of putting murder in people's hearts, I believe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't ought to use the word.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>) might have you up if he (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>) come to hear it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>) would; I only wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>) would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Gollop</b></font>)</div>declared Thomas.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fearless you'd find me, with Eliza's evidence behind me, I can promise you.
<p/>But not him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) knows too well for that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>They stood and rested where Nathan's grave began to yawn beside that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) brother.
<p/>White marble shone out above Vivian, and not only his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) farewell verse, but also a palestric trophy representing the old wrestler's championship belt, was carved there.
<p/>''`Twill make history in more ways than one--this death will,'' foretold Thomas.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think?
<p/>Parson's going to help with the funeral!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>''`Why not?'
<p/>You ask that!
<p/>Nat was a Dissenter and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dissenter</b></font>) dissenting minister be going to bury him (<font color='blue'><b>Dissenter</b></font>); but Masterman says, seeing how highly thought upon he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) was by all parties, that it becomes all parties to be at his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) grave.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>)'s going to be there; and if the bishop comed to learn of it, there'd be a flare-up that might shake England in my opinion.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) reverence says he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)'ll be there, there he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)'ll be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't doubt that.
<p/>My belief is that all's well knowed at headquarters, and they're giving the man rope enough to hang hisself with.
<p/>This may be the last straw.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Gollop</b></font>)</div><p/>Comforted by the reflection, Thomas resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) labours.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)'ll lie cheek by jowl with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go easy in that corner, Joe; us'll be getting to the shoulder of Vivian's bricks afore long.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/>The circumstance of Nathan's passing had been received with very real grief by most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) relations.
<p/>Even distant kindred mourned and not a few of the race, who were strangers to the Baskervilles of Shaugh Prior, appeared at the funeral.
<p/>Mrs. Baskerville of Cadworthy felt helpless and faced almost with a second widowhood, for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) financial affairs had rested in Nathan's willing hand since her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) husband died.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) daughters also mourned in very genuine fashion.
<p/>Their uncle had been kind, helpful, and generous to them.
<p/>Only Mr. Bassett did not greatly suffer, for now he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassett</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassett</b></font>) wife must inherit her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own and hoped, indeed, for some addition under the will of the departed innkeeper.
<p/>As for Rupert Baskerville, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) endured very real grief; but Ned was too concerned with the bearing of this event on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) own affairs to feel it deeply.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) would now be free to administer his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) capital as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) pleased.
<p/>Only his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) mother stood between.
<p/>One black cloud, however, thrust itself upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) immediate future.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) wedding was postponed.
<p/>Cora insisted upon it, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother supported her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>Their motives were widely different, but they arrived at the same conclusion.
<p/>Priscilla hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) grief from all eyes but her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) son's; while he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), less skilled, surprised the folk by his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) evident sorrow.
<p/>They failed to understand it, and acute people laughed, judged it to be simulation, and despised the man for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) display.
<p/>Cora and Phyllis neither pretended nor felt grief.
<p/>The elder had talked her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) sister round, and they arrived at a perfectly rational conclusion.
<p/>It was averse from their father.
<p/>It led them to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as a selfish and a cruel man.
<p/>They considered also that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had deceived himself, and wickedly wronged the unborn that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might perform a far-fetched obligation to the dead.
<p/>Cora put the case very clearly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother won't see it, and 'tis vain to try to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>); and Heathman won't see it, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>)'s a fool, and only just misses being weak in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) head.
<p/>But I see it clear enough, and the ugly truth of the man is that for five thousand pounds he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was content to let his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children come into the world bastards.
<p/>That's what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did, and I'm not going to pretend I care for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) or shall ever respect his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) memory.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll never come out, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phyllis/Phyllis Lintern</b></font>)</div>said Phyllis.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I hope it won't--not out of my mouth, anyway.
<p/>But still it is so, and all the money he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may have left behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't make me feel different.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall be rich, I hope, anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phyllis/Phyllis Lintern</b></font>)</div>speculated Phyllis.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose we shall; and that's the only bright thing about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the mourners</b></font>)</div><p/>''`Twill be funny not walking first behind the coffin, and not sitting in the mourners' pew after for the Sunday sermon; and we knowing all the time that's where we ought to be,'' said the younger; but Cora exploded the theory.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all.
<p/>We've no right there--not the right of the most distant cousin twenty times removed.
<p/>Mother was his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) mistress, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) daren't use the word `husband' even to us, though I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) mouth itching to do it.
<p/>'Tis always `your dear father.'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) can't put on a widow's streamers, though it's in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) heart to.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'ll have to balance her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) black pretty cautious, I can tell you, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) don't want the people to be staring.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely it must all come out if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) money to us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll do it clever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div>said Cora bitterly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``With all his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) faults he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) was clever enough.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) didn't hide this--so clever as a lapwing hides her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) nest--for near thirty years, to let it come out the minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) was dead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I was engaged to be married, like what you are, I shouldn't be so nervous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phyllis/Phyllis Lintern</b></font>)</div>said Phyllis.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to that, 'twas as well for me that it fell out now and not later.
<p/>It may mean a bigger establishment after all; and even a bigger wedding, if I put it off till spring.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My word, what'll Ned say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>But Ned's view did not enter as a serious factor into Cora's.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>)'s all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I'm content, so's he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Storm heralded the funeral day, and dawn blinked red-eyed from much weeping.
<p/>It was hoped that further torrents might hold off until after the ceremony, and happily they did so, though intermittent rain fell and the wind stormed roughly out of a sad-coloured south.
<p/>''`Blessed be the carpse that the rain rains on,''' said Joe Voysey in muffled accents to Jack Head.
<p/>They were walking under the coffin, and bore it, with the assistance of six other men, to the grave.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ban't so blessed for them that's alive, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div>answered Jack.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The mourners will be lashed out of their skins by the look of it.
<p/>Death's never so busy as at a funeral.''
 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>A purple pall spread over the coffin, and while humble men carried the weight of Nathan Baskerville's dust, others of greater repute stood at the corners of the coverlet.
<p/>They included Mr. Luscombe of Trowlesworthy, Timothy Waite of Coldstone Farm, Heathman Lintern as representing Undershaugh, one Mr. Popham from Cornwood, Nathan's lawyer, and others.
<p/>Humphrey Baskerville walked beside the coffin as chief mourner, and Hester Baskerville, on her (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) son Ned's arm, followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) with the rest of the family, save Nathan's namesake, who was at sea.
<p/>Other relations came after them, with Nicholas Bassett, Polly's husband, and Milly, the wife of Rupert.
<p/>Cora and her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) mother and her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) sister were next in the long procession, and half a dozen private carriages stood together beneath the churchyard wall to support a convention and indicate the respect that their owners entertained towards the dead.
<p/>Flowers covered the pall and stood piled beside the grave.
<p/>Crosses, wreaths, and various trophies were here, together with many little humble bunches from cottage gardens, and not a few mere gleanings from the hedgerow of scarlet and crimson berries, or the last autumnal splendour of beech and briar.
<p/>The air was heavy with emotion, and many wept.
<p/>A congregational minister conducted the service, and the vicar helped him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>).
<p/>After the body had sunk to earth and the rite was nearly accomplished, the chief mourners took their last look upon the lid, according to custom.
<p/>Leaves whirled in the air, and the branches overhead made a mighty sigh and swough in the brief silence.
<p/>Underfoot was trampled mire and reeking grass.
<p/>A pushing child slipped in the clay at the grave-mouth, and nearly fell in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) was dragged back by Thomas Gollop and despatched weeping to the rear.
<p/>Humphrey Baskerville came almost the last to look into the grave, and as others had fallen away from it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) assumed a momentary prominence.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) small, bent, and sombre shape appeared alone at the edge of the cleft-in earth, with flowers piled about his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) knees.
<p/>Then suddenly, ominously, cutting its way through the full diapason of the storm-sounds on trees and tower, there crept a different utterance.
<p/>The wind shouted deep and loud; but this noise was thin and harsh--a hissing, a sharp, shrill sibilation that gained volume presently and spread epidemic into the crowded ranks of the collected men.
<p/>They were mostly the young who permitted themselves this attack, but not a few of their elders joined with them.
<p/>The sounds deepened; a groan or two threaded the hisses.
<p/>Then Baskerville, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) abstraction, awakened to the terrific fact that here, beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) brother's grave, in the eyes of all men, a demonstration had broken out against him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/>Hands were pointed, even fists were shaken.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) could not immediately understand; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) looked helplessly into certain angry faces, and then shrank back from the grave to where his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) relations stood.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the meaning of this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) asked Ned; but the young man turned and pretended not to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Then the truth came hurtling like a missile.
<p/>Voices shouted at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the words `murderer' and `brother-killer.'
<p/>The fire that lights a mob into one blaze was afoot, and leaping from heart to head.
<p/>Many for a jest bellowed these insults at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and thought it good for once to bate so unpopular a creature.
<p/>A few in honest and righteous rage cried out their wrath.
<p/>Of such were those who stoned the martyrs to serve their jealous gods.
<p/>More stones than one now actually did fly, and Humphrey was struck upon the arm.
<p/>A counter display of feeling ran like a wave against the enemies of the man, and induced a shock in the crowd.
<p/>Masterman and others laboured to still the gathering storm; women's voices clacked against the gruffer noise of the men.
<p/>Voysey, with admirable presence of mind, drew some boards over the dead in his (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>) grave, that no quick spirit might suddenly fall upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>).
<p/>The disturbance ended as swiftly as it had begun, for Humphrey Baskerville made a bolt, dashed through the crowd, descended the churchyard steps, and reached the street.
<p/>A dozen hastened to follow, but Jack Head, Lintern, Waite, Mr. Masterman, and Ben North, the policeman, resisted the rioters, and kept them within the churchyard walls as far as possible.
<p/>Jack hit so hard that soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was involved in a battle against odds on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own account.
<p/>Meantime, with a clod or two whizzing past his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head, Humphrey reached the street corner and hastened round it.
<p/>Here was silence and peace.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) stopped, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) brain grew dizzy.
<p/>Such exertion he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) had not made for many years.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) heard the noise of men and hastened on.
<p/>A chaos of ideas choked his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) mind and dammed all play of coherent thought.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) had heard a rumour that the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) had done for his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) brother was regarded differently by different men, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) knew not that so many were incensed and enraged.
<p/>The shock of the discovery disarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) now and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) frantic.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) looked forward, and believed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) last hope of reconciliation with humanity was dead.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) envied the eternal peace of his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) brother as he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) struggled on against the hill homeward.
<p/>Into the black and water-logged heart of Shaugh Moor he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) climbed presently, and from exhaustion and faintness fell there.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) stopped upon the ground for a few moments; then lifted himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) hands and knees; then sat down upon a stone and stared down into the theatre of this tragedy.
<p/>Overhead a sky as wild as his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) soul made huge and threatening preparations for the delayed tempest.
<p/>Through the tangled skirts of the darkness westerly there strove and spread great passages of dazzling silver all tattered and torn and shredded out of the black and weltering clouds.
<p/>For a moment in the midst of this radiance there opened a farewell weather-gleam, where the azure firmament was seen only to vanish instantly.
<p/>Then the gloom gathered, and huddled up in ridges of purple and of lead.
<p/>Aloft, from the skirt of the main cumulus, where it swept under the zenith, there hung, light as a veil, yet darker than the sky behind them, long, writhing tentacles, that twisted down and curled in sinister suspension, that waved and twined, and felt hither and thither horribly, like some aerial hydra seeking prey.
<p/>For a time these curtains of the rain swayed clear of earth; but their progress swept them against it, and they burst their vials upon the bosom of the Moor.
<p/>The storm shrieked, exploded, emptied itself with howling rage out of the sudden darkness.
<p/>Then the fury of these tenebrous moments passed; the hurricane sped onward, and the dim wet ray that followed struck down upon a heath whitened with ice for miles.
<p/>A bitterness of cold and an ice-blink of unfamiliar radiance were thrown upwards from the crust of the hail; but soon it melted, and the waste, now running with a million rivulets, grew dark again.
<p/>The spectacle must have been impressive to any peaceful mind, but Baskerville saw nothing hyperbolic in the rage of wind and water.
<p/>The storm cited by Nature was not more tremendous than that tornado now sweeping through his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) own soul.
<p/>END OF SECOND BOOK     BOOK III    CHAPTER I  Humphrey Baskerville continued to stalk the stage of life like a lonely ghost, and still obscured from all men and women the secrets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) nature, and the fierce interest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) heart in matters human.
<p/>The things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) most wished to display he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) deliberately concealed, as a shy child who makes a toy, and longs to show it, but dares not, yet grows warm to the roots of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) being if the treasure is found and applauded.
<p/>Behind doubts, suspicions and jealousies he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) hid himself; his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) tongue was rough; his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) utterances at the outrage put upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) before the people by his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) brother's grave were bitter and even coarse.
<p/>Nor did it abate his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) concern to know that the hostile explosion was as much simulated as genuine, as much mischievous as meant.
<p/>It drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) in upon himself; it poisoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) opinion of human wisdom; and for a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) moved through darkest night.
<p/>Yet this transcendent gloom preceded a dawn; the crisis of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) unquiet days approached; and, from the death of Nathan onward, life changed gradually for the man, and opened into a way that until now had been concealed from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scrutiny.
<p/>There chanced an hour when Humphrey Baskerville rode upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) pony under the high ground above Cornwood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) came by appointment to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) dead brother's lawyer, and accident had postponed the interview for some weeks.
<p/>The solicitor desired to see him (<font color='blue'><b>solicitor</b></font>).
<p/>There were strange rumours in the air, and it was declared that a very surprising and unexpected condition of things had appeared upon the publican's passing.
<p/>Humphrey refused to hear even his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) own relations upon the matter, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) held Nathan's estate no concern of his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>); but at the urgent entreaties of Mr. Popham, the master of Hawk House now rode to see him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) had, however, already made it clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) was to be considered in no way responsible for his (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) brother's obligations, and felt unprepared to offer advice or engage himself in any particular.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) passed across the shoulder of Pen Beacon, through a wild world of dun-coloured hills, streaked with flitting radiance, and clouded in billowy moisture driven before a great wind.
<p/>The sky was lowering, and a gale from the Atlantic swept with tremendous power along; but the nature of the scene it struck was such that little evidence of the force displayed could appear to the beholder.
<p/>Stone and steep and sodden waste stared blindly at the pressure and flinched not.
<p/>It remained for wandering beast or man to bend before it and reveal its might.
<p/>On the pelt of the sheep and cattle, or against the figure of a wanderer, its buffet was manifest; and, in the sky, the fierce breath of it herded the clouds into flocks, that sped and spread and gathered again too swiftly for the telling.
<p/>They broke in billows of sudden light; they massed into darkness and hid the earth beneath them; then again they parted, and, like a ragged flag above a broken army, the clean blue unfurled.
<p/>Over this majestic desolation suddenly there shot forth a great company of rooks, and the wind drove them before it--whirling and wheeling and tumbling in giddy dives, only to mount again.
<p/>A joyous spirit clearly dominated the feathered people.
<p/>They circled and cried aloud in merry exultation of the air.
<p/>They swooped and soared, rushed this way and that on slanting pinions, played together and revelled in the immense force that drove them like projectiles in a wild throng before it.
<p/>Even to these aerial things such speed was strange.
<p/>They seemed to comment in their language upon this new experience.
<p/>Then the instinct unfathomed that makes vast companies of living creatures wheel and warp together in mysterious and perfect unison, inspired them.
<p/>They turned simultaneously, ascended and set their course against the wind.
<p/>But they could make no headway now, and, in a cloud, they were blown together, discomforted, beaten to leeward.
<p/>Whereupon they descended swiftly to the level of the ground, and, flying low, plodded together back whence they had come.
<p/>At a yard or two above earth's surface they steadily flapped along, cheated the wind, and for a few moments flashed a reflected light over the Moor with their innumerable shining black bodies and pinions outspread.
<p/>At a hedge they rose only to dip again, and here Humphrey, who drew up to watch them, marked how they worked in the teeth of the gale, and was near enough to see their great grey bills, their anxious, glittering eyes, and their hurtling feathers blown awry as they breasted the hedge, fought over, and dipped again.
<p/>'''Tis the same as life,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) reflected.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go aloft and strive for high opinions, and the wind of doubt blows you before it like a leaf.
<p/>Up there you can travel with the storm, not against it.
<p/>If you want to go t`other way, you've got to feel along close to earth seemingly--to earth and the manners of earth and the folk of the earth.
<p/>And hard work at that; but better than driving along all alone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) derived some consolation from this inchoate thought, and suspected a moral; but the simile broke down.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) mind returned to Mr. Popham presently, and, taking leave of the Moor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) descended and arrived at the lawyer's house upon the appointed hour.
<p/>The things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) heard, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) was prepared for some such recital, astounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) by their far-reaching gravity.
<p/>The fact was of a familiar character; but it came with the acidulated sting of novelty to those involved.
<p/>An uproar, of which Humphrey in his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) isolation had heard but the dim echo, already rioted through Shaugh Prior, and far beyond it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll give you a sketch of the situation,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man of business.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I will then submit my own theory of it--not that any theory can alter the exceedingly unpleasant facts.
<p/>It belongs merely to the moral side of the situation, and may help a little to condone our poor friend's conduct.
<p/>In a word, I do not believe he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was responsible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Begin at the other end,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>answered Humphrey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) was responsible or not won't help us now.
<p/>And it won't prevent honest men spurning his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) grave, I fancy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Popham/Popham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Popham collected his (<font color='blue'><b>Popham</b></font>) papers and read a long and dismal statement.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Popham</b></font>) client had always kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Popham</b></font>) affairs closely to himself, and such was the universal trust and confidence that none ever pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Popham</b></font>) to do otherwise.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Popham</b></font>) had been given a free hand in the administration of considerable sums; he (<font color='blue'><b>Popham</b></font>) had invested where he (<font color='blue'><b>Popham</b></font>) pleased, and for many years had enjoyed the best of good fortune, despite the hazardous character of the securities he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) affected.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No man was ever cursed with such an incurable gift of hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>explained the lawyer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All along the line you'll find the same sanguine and unjustifiable methods exhibited.
<p/>The rate per cent was all he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) cared about.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) custom was to pay everybody four and a half, and keep the balance.
<p/>But when companies came to grief nobody heard anything about it; he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) went on paying the interest, and, no doubt, went on hoping to make good the capital.
<p/>This, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) seldom appears to have done.
<p/>There are about forty small people who deposited their savings with him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>), and there is nothing for any of them but valueless paper.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was bankrupt a dozen times over, and the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)'d evidently pinned his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) last hope to--a big South American silver mine--is going the way of the others.
<p/>Had it come off, the position might have been retrieved; but it is not coming off.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) put five thousand pounds into it--not his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) own money--and hoped, I suppose, to make thirty thousand.
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) last flutter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) get the money?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By mortgaging Cadworthy and by using a good deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) late brother's capital.
<p/>I mean the estate of Mr. Vivian Baskerville.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) is.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had already mortgaged all his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) own property.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was in a very tight place about the time of Mr. Vivian's death, and the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) had to handle then carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) own money?
<p/>How did he (<font color='blue'><b>Vivian</b></font>) spend that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall never know, unless somebody comes forward and tells us.
<p/>I trace the usual expenditures of a publican and other expenses.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) always kept a good horse or two, and he (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) rode to hounds until latterly, and subscribed to several hunts.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) was foolishly generous at all times.
<p/>I see that he (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) gave away large sums anonymously--but unfortunately they were not his (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) own.
<p/>There is no doubt that his (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) judgment failed completely of late years.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) was so accustomed to success that he (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) had no experience of failure, and when inevitable failures came, they found him (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) quite unprepared with any reserves against them.
<p/>To stem the tide he (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) gambled, and when his (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) speculations miscarried, he (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) waded still more deeply.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) was engaged in borrowing a large sum of money just before his (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) final illness.
<p/>Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) came to me for it, for he (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) kept me quite in the dark concerning existing mortgages on his (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) property.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) forgot I should want the title-deeds.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) was a devious man, but I shall always believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) lacked moral understanding to know the terrible gravity of the things he (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) did.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do we stand now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The estate is from six thousand to seven thousand pounds to the bad.''

<p/>About forty pounds at the bank, and the furniture at `The White Thorn' Inn.
<p/>Of course, his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorn</b></font>) largest creditor will be Mr. Ned Baskerville, of Cadworthy Farm.
<p/>I want to say, by the way, that this state of things is quite as much of a surprise to me as to anybody.
<p/>It is true that I have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) solicitor for twenty years, but my work was nominal.
<p/>I had no knowledge whatever of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) affairs.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true, indeed.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>''`If.'
<p/>There's generally a rather big `if' with a South American anything, I believe.''
<p/>They parted, and Humphrey Baskerville rode home again.
<p/>Upon the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) deeply pondered all the things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had heard, and not until he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was back at Hawk House did distraction from these thoughts come.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) found that a woman waited to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/>It was Priscilla Lintern, who had called at his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) invitation; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>), and half regretted the act.
<p/>CHAPTER II  Mrs. Lintern arrived by appointment, for while one instinct of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) nature pressed Humphrey to evade this problem and take no hand in the solution, another and more instant impulse acted in opposition.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) surveyed the sweep of events as they struck at those involved in Nathan's ruin and death; and acting upon reasons now to be divulged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) sent first for the mistress of Undershaugh; because in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) judgment her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) right to consideration was paramount.
<p/>Even in the act of summoning her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) told himself that these claims were no business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) to investigate; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) was a fool to meddle.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) repudiated responsibility at one breath, and deliberately assumed it with the next.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) own motives he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) did not pause to examine.
<p/>Introspection irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) turned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) conflicting ideas with impatience.
<p/>In himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) only saw a very ill-balanced, imprudent, and impertinent person; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) proceeded.
<p/>Now came Mrs. Lintern to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) would have, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) with an emotion of hearty regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) had invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>).
<p/>In answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) first question she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) children were well.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid putting off the wedding has annoyed your nephew a good bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but Cora felt that it was better; and so did I.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) strokes her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) chin like Nat stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) beard.
<p/>Have you marked that?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) thinks just like Nat thought in a lot of ways, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>)'s not got his (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) heart.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>)'s not near so silly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) was.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) voice was the echo to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) as soon as I got the clue.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) eyes were his (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) handles her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) knife and fork just like he (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) was wont to do it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) sets her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) head o' one side to listen to anybody in the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) did.
<p/>There's birds do it too--when they gather worms out of the grass.

<p/>Your second girl be more like you; but Heathman will be nearer his (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) father every day as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) gets older.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) growed a beard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>)'d be nearer him (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) now.
<p/>Wait and watch.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>)'s got his (<font color='blue'><b>Nat</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Don't speak till you hear more.
<p/>From finding out that much, I sounded Nathan himself.
<p/>Little he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) guessed it, but what I didn't know, I soon learned from him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>).
<p/>Cora was the apple of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) eye.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could do no wrong.
<p/>'Twas Vivian and Ned over again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) spoke of you very guarded, but I knew what was behind.
<p/>It came out when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) was dying, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) was too far gone to hide it.
<p/>And let me say this: I'll never forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) for doing such a wicked thing--never.
<p/>God may; but I won't.
<p/>I wouldn't forgive myself if I forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not even confirm it in words, but granted it and proceeded with the argument.

<p/>They never identified Priscilla with the vanished innkeeper; they did not scruple to censure Nathan before her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) and heap obloquy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) fallen head.
<p/>Often with heart and soul she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) longed to fight for him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>); often she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) had some ado to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) impotent anger; but a lifetime of dissimulation had skilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) in the art of self-control.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) listened and looked upon the angry man or woman; she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) even acquiesced in the abuse by silence.
<p/>Seldom did she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) defend the dead man, excepting in secret against her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) daughters.
<p/>CHAPTER III  When Cora Lintern returned home she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) a resolution.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) intentions were calculated to cause pain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) carried them so much the quicker to execution, that the thing might be done and the blow struck as swiftly as possible.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) revealed her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) plan to none, and only made it public when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) who was chiefly involved had learned it.
<p/>Ned Baskerville called to see Cora, who had been stopping with friends; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) had spoken upon general subjects, she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) come out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) to the wintry side of West Down, and there imparted her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) wintry news.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you found anything to do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>was Cora's first question, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) had not.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``People don't understand me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is Rupert talking about labourer's work, as if it was a perfectly decent suggestion to make.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course.

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) shoulders.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Thereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) swore wild oaths and rushed off and left her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) on the hillside alone.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was gone she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) went her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) own way, but not to Undershaugh.
<p/>By deep lanes and field-paths familiar to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) took a long walk, and at the end of it found herself at Coldstone Farm, the abode of Mr. Timothy Waite.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) was from home, and she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) asked for pen and paper that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) might leave a note for him (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) communication was short, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had written it and sealed it with exceeding care, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) set off again for home.
<p/>Anon Mr. Waite opened it and was much disappointed at the length.
<p/>But Cora's matter atoned for this shortcoming.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have settled with N.B.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) steadied his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) steps, stood at the Moor edge in two minds, then turned and set off for Hawk House.
<p/>This blow had staggered him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>), had even awakened him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) from the fatuous dream in which he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) days.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) had a vague idea that Humphrey might be glad to know of this broken engagement; that it might even put his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) uncle into a more amiable temper.
<p/>Ned had been advised by Rupert to see Mr. Baskerville; but had declined to do so until the present time.
<p/>At Hawk House Mrs. Hacker met him (<font color='blue'><b>Hawk</b></font>) and made no effort to hide astonishment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wonders never cease, I'm sure!

<p/>When next you find yourself caddling about on the Moor wasting your time, take a look at the roundy-poundies--they circles of stones cast about on the hillsides and by the streams.
<p/>My son Mark knew all about them.
<p/>They were set up by men like ourselves who lived on the Moor very long ago.
<p/>Life was real then.
<p/>Nought but their own sweat stood between the old men and destruction.
<p/>The first business of life was to keep life in them days.
<p/>They hunted to live, not for pleasure.
<p/>They hunted and were hunted.
<p/>No time to be lazy then.
<p/>Did they help beggars?
<p/>Did they keep paupers?
<p/>No; all had to toil for the common good; and if a man didn't labour, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't eat.
<p/>They had their work cut out for 'em to wring a bare living out of the earth and the creatures on it.
<p/>No softness of mind or body then.
<p/>No holidays and pleasurings and revels then.
<p/>And I'd have it so again to-morrow, if I could.
<p/>Work and eat; idle and starve--that's what I'd say to my fellow-creatures.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to work; I'm ready for work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All very well to say that now.
<p/>You may be ready for work; but what sort of work is ready for you?
<p/>What can you do?
<p/>Can you break stones?
<p/>There's a Cornish proverb hits you this minute: `Them as can't scheme must lowster.'
<p/>Your father was very fond of using it--to every lazy body but you.
<p/>It means that if you haven't the wits to make a living with your brains, you must do it with your hands.
<p/>It all comes back to work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it does.
<p/>I keep on telling you I'm ready for it--any amount of it.
<p/>But not breaking stones.
<p/>I've got brains in my head, though I know you don't think so.
<p/>I came to-day to know if you would give those brains a trial.
<p/>I'm a free man now.
<p/>Cora has flung me over, so there's no obligation anywhere.
<p/>I'm free to stand up and show what I'm good for.
<p/>I've sold my horses and given up hunting already.
<p/>That's something.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't ask for money; I only suggested a loan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll loan no loans to you or any man.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Double it!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's my word; and now the boot's on the other leg, and I'm the fool for my pains, no doubt.
<p/>But understand me.

<p/>But let there be no hookemsnivey dealings, for I'll very soon find them out if you try it.
<p/>Let it be figures, let it be horses, let it be clay, let it be stones by the road--I'll double what you earn for five years.
<p/>By that time, maybe, you'll know what work means, and thank Heaven, that's taught you what it means.
<p/>Go and find work--that's what you've got to do; go and find what you're worth in the open market of men.
<p/>And you needn't thank me for what I offer.
<p/>`Twill be little enough, I promise you--as you'll find when you come to hear the money value of your earning powers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the same I do thank you, and I thank you with all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Ned: <div class="bookquote">``and perhaps you'll be a bit more astonished than you think for, Uncle Humphrey, when you find what I can do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) nephew went away in doubt whether to be elated or cast down.
<p/>CHAPTER IV  An elderly man called Abraham Elford became tenant of `The White Thorn' after Baskerville's death.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) lacked the charm of Nathan, and it was rumoured that the quality of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) liquor by no means equalled that provided by the vanished master of the inn; but no choice offered of other drinking houses, and the new publican retained all former patronage.
<p/>One subject at this season proved rich enough to shut out all lesser matters from conversation, for the wide waves of concern set rolling when Nathan died had as yet by no means subsided.
<p/>Each day for many days brought news of some fresh disaster to humble folk; and then came another sort of intelligence that gratified the few and angered the many.
<p/>Mr. Elford and certain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elford</b></font>) customers, not directly interested, found the subject of Nathan's affairs exceedingly wearisome and often sought to turn talk into other channels; but not for long could they be said to succeed.
<p/>Local politics and weather soon lost their power to hold the people; and those disasters spread by the late publican swiftly cropped up again to the exclusion of less pungent concerns.
<p/>A party of men was assembled at `The White Thorn' near Christmas time, and they wrangled on over this well-trodden ground until Joe Voysey, who had not suffered, turned to the grey-headed host behind the bar and asked a question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did this here fire fail afore you comed, Abraham?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) asked.
<p/>'''Tis a well-known fact that `The White Thorn' hearth haven't been cold for a hundred year--peat always smouldering, or else blazing, upon it.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and a thousand pities,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the other.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At the time of Mr. Baskerville's death, of course, there was a terrible deal of running about and confusion.
<p/>And the fire was forgot.
<p/>I knowed the old saying and was very sorry to see it black out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do it matter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Jack Head.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) was in a quarrelsome mood and bad company on the occasion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``These silly sayings and fancies are better forgot.
<p/>Who's the wiser for a thing like that?
<p/>Probably, when all's said, 'tis a lie.
<p/>I dare say the fire went out scores of times when Nathan was here, and somebody just lit it again and said nought about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's wrong, Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div>declared Heathman Lintern, who was present.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Baskerville took a lot of care of the fire and felt very proud of it.
<p/>A score of times I've heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) tell people about it, and that the fire had never been douted for more than a hundred years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One thing I know, that if there was such a place as hell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)'d soon meet with a fire as would last longer still,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A fire that never will be douted.
<p/>And right well he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)'d deserve it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Gollop</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomas Gollop found himself in agreement with this ferocity.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're right there, and there is such a place--have no fear of that, though 'tis your way to scorn it.
<p/>For my part I say that there couldn't be no justice without it.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man can backbite the dead, and spit out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) poison against them as never hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in word or deed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div>answered Heathman Lintern.
<p/>'''Tis always your way to blackguard them that be out of earshot and the power to answer; and the further a man be away, the louder you yelp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You Linterns--well, I'll say nought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div>began Jack Head; but the subject was too attractive for him (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) proceeded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) left your mother any money, it's against the law, and you can tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) so.
<p/>It wasn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) to leave, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got money from him (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) in secret, it's my money--not hers--mine, and many other people's before it's hers.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You talk of the law,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div>answered Jack.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there to be nought declared in the pound?''
 (<font color='red'><b>an man</b></font>)</div><p/>inquired an old man beside the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a mean cur at heart, Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>burst out the dead man's son to Mr. Head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll all come, if you'll promise another drink at t`other end,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div>declared Heathman; but Susan turned to Jack Head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd best to come, Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) declared.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) exhibited indifference, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) agreed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I've got a man to look after me, there's no hurry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) concluded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm in for a wigging as 'tis.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Head</b></font>)</div><p/>The easy soul stopped on until closing time, and then Mr. Head fulfilled his (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) promise and walked homeward beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) through a foggy night.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) rested repeatedly while climbing the hill to the Moor, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) talked without ceasing.
<p/>Susan was exhilarated and loquacious as the result of too much to drink.
<p/>Head, however, bore with her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) and acquired a most startling and unexpected piece of information.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) mentioned the attitude of Heathman Lintern and his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) fiery championship of the dead.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>)'d have come across and hit me down, because I told the naked truth about the man.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) denied that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother was the better by a penny when Nathan died.
<p/>But how about it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) was alive?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Truth's truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Hacker/Hacker</b></font>)</div>answered Susan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might have knocked me down with a feather when--but there, what am I saying?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) smelt a secret and angled for it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, you're like one of the Baskerville family yourself, and I've no right to ask you things; only such a man as me with a credit for sense be different to the talking sort.
<p/>Truth's truth, as you say, and the truth will out.
<p/>But Eliza Gollop--of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) knows nothing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) couldn't keep a secret like you or me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hacker</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Hacker stood still again and breathed hard in the darkness.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) tongue itched to tell a tremendous thing known to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>); but her (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) muddled senses fought against this impropriety.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Two can often keep a secret that pretty well busts one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Head</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Head with craft.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) believed that Humphrey Baskerville was paying some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) brother's debts; and since this procedure might reach to him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) felt the keenest interest in it.
<p/>Mrs. Lintern did not concern him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had merely mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>).
<p/>But Priscilla was the subject which filled Susan's mind to the exclusion of all lesser things, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) throbbed to impart her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) knowledge.
<p/>No temptation to confide in another had forced itself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) until the present; yet with wits loosened and honour fogged by drink, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) now yearned to speak.
<p/>At any other moment such a desire must have been silenced, by reason of the confession of personal wrongdoing that it entailed.
<p/>Now, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) did not remember that.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was only lusting to tell, and quite forgot how she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had learned.
<p/>Thus, while Head, to gain private ends, endeavoured to find whether Mr. Baskerville was paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) brother's debts, Susan supposed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) mind ran upon quite another matter: the relations between Priscilla Lintern and Humphrey's dead brother.
<p/>Mrs. Hacker knew the truth.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) had acquired it in the crudest manner, by listening at the door during an interview between Nathan's mistress and her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) master.
<p/>This tremendous information had burnt her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) soul to misery ever since; but a thousand reasons for keeping the secret existed.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) own good name was involved as much as another's.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) could not whisper a word for her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) credit's sake; and a cause that weighed far heavier with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was the credit of Eliza Gollop.
<p/>Eliza had guessed darkly at what Susan now knew; but as a result of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) subterranean hints, Eliza had suffered in the public esteem, for few believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>).
<p/>To confirm Eliza and ratify her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) implications was quite the last thing that Mrs. Hacker would have desired to do; and yet such was the magic sleight of alcohol to masquerade in the shape of reason, justice, and right--such also its potency to conceal danger--that now this muddled woman fell.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was intelligent enough to make Jack promise on Bible oaths that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would keep her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) secret; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) the last thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) expected to hear.
<p/>With acute interest he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) waited to know Humphrey's future intentions respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) brother's creditors; instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) listened to widely different facts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you if you'll swear by the Book to keep it to yourself.

<p/>I was just going into the room, but stopped at the door for some reason, and, before I could get out of earshot, I'd catched it.
<p/>There!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say you was eavesdropping and have done with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Head</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Head.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) took this startling news very quietly, and advised Susan to do the like.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The less you think about it, the better.
<p/>What's done be done.
<p/>We don't know none of the rights of it, and I'm not the sort to blame anybody--woman or man--for their private actions.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't ought to have told you, but my mind's a sieve if there's a drop of gin in my stomach.

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Hacker/Hacker</b></font>)</div><p/>Susan became lachrymose, but Jack renewed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) promises and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) tolerably collected.
<p/>The confession had eased her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) mind, calmed its excitement, and silenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) tongue also.
<p/>Jack tried to learn more of the thing that interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) personally, but upon that subject she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) knew nothing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) believed the general report: that Mr. Masterman, by secret understanding with the lawyer, was relieving the poorest of Nathan's creditors; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) inclined to the opinion that her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) master had no hand in this philanthropy.
<p/>They parted at the garden wicket of Susan's home, and Mr. Head left her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) there; but not before she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) swear again with all solemnity to keep the secret.
<p/>CHAPTER V  As Humphrey Baskerville had pointed out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) nephew Ned, disaster usually hits the weak harder than the strong, and the lazy man suffers more at sudden reverses than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbour, who can earn a living, come what trouble may.
<p/>Rupert and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) wife were prepared to seek a new home, and Milly, at the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) heart, suffered less from these tribulations than any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) husband's relations.
<p/>The blow had robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) of nothing, since he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) possessed nothing.
<p/>To work to win Cadworthy was no longer possible, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might do as well and save money as steadily elsewhere; and the change in their lives for Milly meant something worth having.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) heart was a secret wish that her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) coming child might be born in her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) own home.
<p/>As for her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) husband he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) now waited his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) time, and did not immediately seek work, because Humphrey Baskerville directed delay.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) reason was not given, nor would he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) commit himself to any promise; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) offered the advice, and Rupert took it.
<p/>Mrs. Baskerville's grief at leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) home proved excessive.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) belonged to the easy sort of people who are glad to trust their affairs in any capable control, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) suffered now at this sudden catastrophe, even as Ned suffered.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had very little money, and was constrained to look to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) sons for sustenance.
<p/>It was proposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) and May should find a cottage at Shaugh; but to display her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) poverty daily before eyes that had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) prosperity was not good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) found it hard to decide, and finally hoped to continue life in a more distant hamlet.
<p/>All was still in abeyance, and the spring had come.
<p/>Until Ned's future theatre of toil was certain, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) mother would not settle anything.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) trusted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) might win a respectable post, but employment did not offer.
<p/>Hester's youngest son Humphrey had been provided for by a friend, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) was now working with Saul Luscombe at Trowlesworthy.
<p/>Then came a date within six weeks of the family's departure.
<p/>The packing was advanced, and still nothing had been quite determined.
<p/>Ned was anxious and troubled; Rupert waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) uncle to speak.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) knew of good work at Cornwood, and it was decided that his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) mother and May should also move to a cottage in that churchtown, unless Ned achieved any sort of work within the next few weeks.
<p/>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) plans might help to determine their own.
<p/>At this juncture, unexpectedly on a March evening, came their kinsman from Hawk House, and Rupert met him (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) at the outer gate.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is your mother here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the rider</b></font>)</div><p/>asked the rider, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) heard that the family was within--save Ned, who stayed at Tavistock on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) quest--he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) dismounted and came among them.
<p/>A litter and disorder marked the house.
<p/>There were packing-cases in every room; but less than a moiety of Hester's goods would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) home.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must dwell in a small cottage henceforth, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) furniture, with much of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) china and other precious things, was presently destined to be sold.
<p/>The period of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) greatest grief had long passed; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had faced the future with resignation for many months, and returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) usual placidity.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter could even plan their little possessions in a new cottage, and smile together again.
<p/>They had fitted their minds to the changed condition; they had calculated the probable result of the sale, and Mrs. Baskerville, thrown by these large reverses from her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) former easy and tranquil optimism, had fallen upon the opposite extreme.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) now looked for no amelioration of the future, foresaw no possibility of adequate work for Ned, and was as dumb as a wounded horse or cow, even at the tragical suggestion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) son's enlistment.
<p/>This he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had openly discussed, but finding that none exhibited any horror before the possibility, soon dropped it again.
<p/>To these people came Mr. Baskerville--small, grey, saturnine.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) eyes were causing him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) some trouble, and their rims were grown red.
<p/>They thought in secret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had never looked uglier, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) declared openly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had seldom felt worse.
<p/>'''Tis the season of the year that always troubles me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gout, gravel, rheumatism, lumbagy--all at me together.
<p/>Nature is a usurer, Hester, as you may live to find out yet, for all you keep so healthy.

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) obeyed at once, and Humphrey, exhibiting a most unusual garrulity and egotism, continued to discuss himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For all my carcase be under the weather, my mind is pretty clear for me.

<p/>'Twas all put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) hands when Vivian died.

<p/>Milly stopped with Mrs. Baskerville; May went to the door with her (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) uncle and helped him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) coat.

<p/>Rupert helped Mr. Baskerville on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) pony and walked beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>the footfall</b></font>)</div><p/>They passed along, and the snow silenced the footfall of horse and man.

<p/>CHAPTER VI  The effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) financial tribulation on Jack Head was not good.
<p/>Whatever might have been of Humphrey Baskerville's theories as to the value worldly misfortune and the tonic property of bad luck upon character, in this man's case the disappearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) savings deranged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) usual common-sense, and indicated that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rational outlook was not based upon sure foundations.
<p/>From the trumpery standpoint of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) personal welfare, it seemed, after all, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appraised life; and upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loss a native acerbity and intolerance increased.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grew morose, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quality of humour failed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, deprived of this cathartic and salutary sense, grew stagnant.
<p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best Jack was never famed for a delicate choice of time or place when pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opinions.
<p/>Propriety in this connection he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took pleasure in disregarding.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flouted convention, and loved best to burst his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bombshells where they were most certain to horrify and anger.
<p/>Following the manner of foolish propagandists, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seldom selected the psychological moment for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) onslaughts; nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) perceive that half the battle in these cases may depend upon nice choice of opportunity.
<p/>There came an evening, some time after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had learnt the secret of the Lintern family, when Head, returning to Shaugh Prior, fell in with Cora, who walked upon the same road.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) had never liked her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and now remembered certain aggressive remarks recently cast at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother.
<p/>The man was going slower than the woman, and had not meant to take any notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but the somewhat supercilious nod she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) touched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spleen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pace and went along beside her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll have a tell with you.
<p/>'Tisn't often you hear sense, I believe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Cora, for once in a mood wholly seraphic over private affairs, showed patience.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm in a bit of a hurry, but I've always got time to hear sense,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/>Thus unexpectedly met, Mr. Head found himself with nothing to say.
<p/>One familiar complaint at that time running against Cora for the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) forgot.
<p/>Therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) fell back upon her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might tell Heathman I was a good bit crossed at the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) spoke to me two nights agone.
<p/>I've as much right to my opinion as him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>), and if I say that the late Nathan Baskerville was no better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) should be, and not the straight, God-fearing man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made us think--well, I'm only saying what everybody knows.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly a good many people know that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly so.
<p/>Then why for does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jump down my throat as if I was backbiting the dead?
<p/>Truth's truth, and it ban't a crime to tell the truth about a man after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s dead, any more than it be while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s alive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More it is.
<p/>Very often you don't know the truth till a man's dead.
<p/>My brother's a bit soft.
<p/>All the same, you must speak of people as you find them.
<p/>And Heathman had no quarrel with Mr. Baskerville, though most sensible people had seemingly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was a tricky man, and nobody can pretend he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was honest or straight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)'s left a deal of misery behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>The relationship between Cora and Nathan Baskerville suddenly flashed into Jack's memory.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) remark told him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) another fact: he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) judged from it that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could not be aware of the truth.
<p/>It seemed improbable that Cora could utter such a sentiment if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) father.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) remembered how Heathman certainly knew the truth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) assumed that Cora must also know it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was, therefore, revealing her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) true thoughts, secure in the belief that, since her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) companion would be ignorant of the relationship between her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) and the dead, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) need pretend to no conventional regard before him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>).
<p/>At another time Jack Head might have approved her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) frankness, but to-day he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) designed to quarrel, and chose to be angered at this unfilial spirit.
<p/>Upon that subject his (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) mouth was sealed, but there returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) the recollection of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) last achievement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) of it and rated her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) bitterly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well for you to talk of dishonest men and crooked dealings,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) retorted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, that don't know the meaning of a straight deed--you that flung over one chap and made him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) hang himself, and now have flung over another.
<p/>You may flounce and flirt and walk quick, but I'll walk quick too, and I tell you you're no better than a giglet wench--heartless, greedy, good for nought.
<p/>You chuck Ned Baskerville after keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) on the hooks for years.
<p/>And why?
<p/>Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) came down in the world with a run, and you knew that you'd have to work if you took him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>), and couldn't wear fine feathers and ape the beastly people who drive about in carriages.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) lips tightened and she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) flashed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You stupid fool!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, of all others, to blame me--you, who were never tired of bawling out what a worthless thing the man was.
<p/>You ought to be the first to say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s properly punished, and the first to say I'm doing the right thing; and so you would, but just because you've lost a few dirty pounds, you go yelping and snarling at everybody.
<p/>You're so mighty clever that perhaps you'll tell me why I should marry a pauper, who can't find work far or near, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s never learnt how to work.
<p/>Why must I keep in with a man like that, and get children for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and kill myself for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and go on the parish at the end?
<p/>You're so fond of putting everybody right, perhaps you'll put me right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The other was not prepared for this vigorous counter-attack.

<p/>You was only in love with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cash, and hadn't got no use for the man.
<p/>I'm not saying you would do well to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for the minute; but to chuck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s down--''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're a one-sided idiot--like most other men,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) answered.

<p/>There, you make a sane woman wild!
<p/>Waiting, waiting--and what becomes of me while I'm waiting?
<p/>I'm a lovely woman, you old fool, don't you understand what that means?
<p/>Waiting--waiting--and will time wait?
<p/>Look at the crows'-feet coming.
<p/>Look at the line betwixt my eyebrows and the lines from my nose, each side, to the corners of my mouth.
<p/>Will they wait?
<p/>No, curse 'em, they get deeper and deeper, and no rubbing will rub 'em out, and no waiting will make them lighter.
<p/>So easy to bleat about `faithfulness' and `patience' if you're ugly as a gorilla and flat as a pancake.
<p/>I'm lovely, and I'm a pauper, and I've got nought but loveliness to stand between me and a rotten life and a rotten death in the workhouse.
<p/>So there it is.
<p/>Don't preach no more of your cant to me, for I won't have it.''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was furious; the good things in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mind had slipped for the moment away.
<p/>While uttering this tirade she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stood still, and Mr. Head did the like.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) argument perfectly well.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had reason on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) side, but her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) impatience and scorn angered him (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) main position he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) could not shake, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) turned upon a minor issue and made feeble retort.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) answer failed dismally in every way.
<p/>Of its smallness and weakness she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) took instant advantage; and, further, it reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) of the satisfactory event that Mr. Head had for the moment banished from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mind.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hard words won't make the case better for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) began.

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sneered at him (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Parson's talk--and poor at that.

<p/>You're terrible fond of saying everybody's a fool--well, `twill take you all your time to find a bigger one than yourself after to-day.
<p/>And don't you never speak to me again, because I won't have it.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, `him (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>)'; and now you can go further off, and keep further off in future.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hastened forward to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) news to other ears, and Jack Head stood still until she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was out of sight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) felt exceedingly angry, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) anger swiftly diminished, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) even found it possible to laugh at himself before he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) reached Shaugh Prior.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) knew right well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) must look a fool, but the knowledge did not increase his (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) liking for Cora Lintern.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) reflected on what he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) had heard, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) making fun of him (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) in many quarters.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) even debated a revenge, but no way offered.
<p/>Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) speculated as to what her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) betrothed would say if he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) knew the truth of Cora's paternity; but, to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) justice, not the faintest thought of revealing the secret tempted Jack.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'ll most likely wreck herself with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) thought.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Waite's a sharp chap, and not easily hoodwinked.
<p/>So like as not, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s seen a bit of her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) mean soul he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'ll think twice while there's time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Head</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Head began to reflect again upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) own affairs, and, finding himself at the vicarage gate, went in and asked for Dennis Masterman.
<p/>The rumour persisted, and even grew, that Dennis was paying back certain losses incurred at Nathan Baskerville's death among the poorest of the community.
<p/>The fact had wounded Mr. Head's sense of justice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) was determined to throw some light on Masterman's foggy philanthropy.
<p/>The vicar happened to be in, and soon Mr. Head appeared before him (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>).
<p/>Their interview lasted exactly five minutes, and Jack was in the street again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) explained his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) theory at some length, and gave it as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) opinion that to pick and choose the cases was not defensible.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) then explained his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own loss, and invited Mr. Masterman to say whether a more deserving and unfortunate man might be found within the quarters of the parish.
<p/>The clergyman listened patiently and answered with brevity.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear some of the people are being helped, but personally the donor is not known to me.
<p/>I have nothing to do with it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>donor</b></font>), or she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)--probably a lady, for they do that sort of thing oftenest--is not responsible to anybody; but, as far as I have heard, a very good choice has been made among the worst sufferers.
<p/>As to your case, Jack, it isn't such a very hard one.
<p/>You are strong and hale still, and you've got nobody to think of but yourself.
<p/>We know, at any rate, that Mr. Nathan Baskerville did a lot of good with other people's money.
<p/>Isn't that what you Socialists are all wanting to do?
<p/>But I dare say this misfortune has modified your views a little here and there.
<p/>I've never yet met a man with fifty pounds in the bank who was what I call a Socialist.
<p/>Good-evening to you, Jack.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/Alice Masterman</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VII  Alice Masterman, the vicar's sister, came in to speak with Dennis after Jack Head had gone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) was composing a sermon, but set it aside at once, for the tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) voice declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) could brook no denial.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Voysey,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't actually steal, I suppose, but look at the seed and the thousand and one things he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s always wanting in the garden, and nothing to show but weeds.''

<p/>But next Sunday the unexpected happened, and Thomas Gollop, even in the clergyman's opinion, exceeded the bounds of decency by a scandalous omission.
<p/>It happened thus.
<p/>The sexton, going his (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>) rounds before morning service, was confronted with an unfamiliar object in the churchyard.
<p/>A tombstone had sprung up above the dust of Nathan Baskerville.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) eyes with astonishment, because the time for a memorial was not yet, and Thomas must first have heard of it and made ready before its erection.
<p/>Here, however, stood what appeared to be a square slate, similar in design to those about it; but investigation proved that an imitation stone had been set up, and upon the boards, painted to resemble slate, was inscribed a ribald obituary notice of the dead.
<p/>It scoffed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) pretensions, stated the worst that could be said against him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), and concluded with a scurrility in verse that consigned him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to the devil.
<p/>Now, by virtue of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) office, apart from the fact of being a responsible man enlisted on the side of all that was seemly and decorous, Mr. Gollop should have removed this offence as quickly as possible before any eye could mark it.
<p/>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) would have disappointed those of the baser sort who had placed it there by night, and arrested an outrage before any harm was done by it.
<p/>But, instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) studied the inscription with the liveliest interest, and found himself much in sympathy therewith.
<p/>Here was the world's frank opinion on Nathan Baskerville.
<p/>The innkeeper deserved such a censure, and Thomas saw no particular reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) should interfere.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was alone, and none had observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>).
<p/>Therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) shuffled off and, rather than fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) spade and barrow to dig up this calumny and remove it, left the board for others to discover.
<p/>This they did before the bells began to ring, and when Dennis Masterman entered the churchyard, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) way to the vestry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) was arrested by the sight of a considerable crowd collected about the Baskerville graves.
<p/>The people were trampling over the mounds, and standing up on the monuments to get a better view.
<p/>On the outskirt of the gathering was Ben North in a state of great excitement; but single-handed the policeman found himself unable to cope with the crowd.
<p/>A violent quarrel was proceeding at the centre of this human ring, and Masterman heard Gollop's voice and that of Heathman Lintern.
<p/>Dennis ordered some yelling choir-boys down off a flat tomb, then pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dennis</b></font>) way through his (<font color='blue'><b>Dennis</b></font>) congregation.
<p/>Parties had been divided as to the propriety of the new monument, and the scene rather resembled that in the past, when Nathan Baskerville was buried.
<p/>As the vicar arrived, Heathman Lintern, who had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) self-control, was just knocking Mr. Gollop backwards into the arms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) sister.
<p/>The man and woman fell together, and, with cries and hisses, others turned on Heathman.
<p/>Then a force rallied to the rescue.
<p/>Sunday hats were hurled off and trampled into the grass; Sunday coats were torn; Sunday collars were fouled.
<p/>Not until half a dozen men, still fighting, had been thrust out of the churchyard, was Dennis able to learn the truth.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dennis</b></font>) examined the cause of the riot and listened to Lintern.
<p/>The young man was bloody and breathless, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gasped out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tale.
<p/>A dozen people were already inspecting the new gravestone when Heathman passed the church on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way to chapel with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother and sisters.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left them to see the cause of interest, and, discovering it, ordered Gollop instantly to remove it.
<p/>This the sexton declined to do on the ground that it was Sunday.
<p/>Thereupon, fetching tools, Heathman himself prepared to dig up the monument.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>) was prevented.
<p/>Many of the people approved of the joke and decreed that the board must stand.
<p/>They arrested Heathman in his (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>) efforts to remove it.
<p/>Then others took his (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>) side and endeavoured to drag down the monument.
<p/>Having heard both Lintern and Gollop, the clergyman read the mock inscription.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``D'you mean to say that you refuse to remove this outrageous thing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) asked the sexton; but Thomas was in no mood for further reprimand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had suffered a good deal in credit and temper.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) mopped a bleeding nose and was insolent.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do; and I won't break the Fourth Commandment for you or fifty parsons.
<p/>Who the mischief be you to tell me to labour on the Lord's Day, I should like to know?
<p/>You'll bid me covet my neighbour's ass and take my neighbour's wife next, perhaps?
<p/>And, when all's said, this writing be true and a lesson to the parish.
<p/>Let 'em have the truth for once, though it do turn their tender stomachs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get out of the churchyard, you old blackguard!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Heathman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a disgrace to any persuasion, and you did ought to be hounded out of a decent village.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave Gollop to me, Lintern.
<p/>Now lend a hand here, a few of you; get this infamous thing away and destroyed before anybody else sees it.
<p/>And the rest go into church at once.
<p/>Put on your surplices quick, you boys; and you, Jenkins, tell Miss Masterman to play another voluntary.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div><p/>Dennis issued his (<font color='blue'><b>Dennis</b></font>) orders and then helped to dig up this outrage among the tombs.
<p/>Thomas Gollop and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) sister departed together.
<p/>Ben North, Lintern, and another assisted Mr. Masterman.
<p/>Then came Humphrey Baskerville upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) way to church, and, despite the entreaty of the young clergyman that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) would not read the thing set up over Nathan's grave, insisted on doing so.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear in the street there's been a row about a tombstone to my brother.
<p/>Who put it there?
<p/>'Tis too soon by half.
<p/>I shall lift a stone to the man when the proper time comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't a stone, it's an unseemly insult--an outrage.
<p/>Not the work of Shaugh men, I hope.
<p/>I shall investigate the thing to the bottom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div>answered Dennis.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see.
<p/>Stay your hand, Lintern.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) glasses deliberately, and read the evil words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tear it down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That ban't all the truth about the man, and half the truth is none.
<p/>Quick, away with it!
<p/>There's my sister-in-law from Cadworthy coming into the gate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div><p/>The burlesque tombstone was hurried away, and Masterman went into the vestry.
<p/>Others entered church, and Heathman at last found himself alone.
<p/>The bells stopped, the organ ceased to grunt, and the service proceeded; but young Lintern was only concerned with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) own labours.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) ransacked Mr. Gollop's tool-shed adjoining the vestry.
<p/>It was locked, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) broke it open, and, finding a hatchet there, proceeded to make splinters of the offending inscription.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) chopped and chopped until his (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) usual equitable humour returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>).
<p/>Then, the work completed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) father's grave and repaired the broken mound.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) was engaged upon this task to the murmur of the psalms, when Jack Head approached and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) `good-morning.'
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A pretty up-store, I hear.
<p/>And you in the midst of it--eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was, and I'd do the same for any chap that did such a beastly thing.
<p/>If I thought you had any hand in it, Jack--''   (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>The other remembered that the son of the dead was speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a pretty big grudge against Nathan Baskerville that was, and I won't deny it; but this here--insults on his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) tomb--'tis no better than to kick the dead.

<p/>It won't right the wrong, or put my money back in my pocket.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've forgot 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div>answered Heathman.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) laughed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should `a' seen the old monkey just now!

<p/>Both dropped; then Tom Sparkes hit me in the mouth; and so we went on very lively till Mr. Masterman came.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't have missed it for money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div>said Jack.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But just my luck to be t`other side the village at such a moment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) sat down on a sepulchre and filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pipe.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knew well why Heathman had thrown himself so fiercely into this quarrel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) for it.
<p/>The sight of the young man reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) sister.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So your Cora is trying a third, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) tells me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; 'tis Tim Waite this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div>answered Cora's brother.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) got the best of the argument--I'll allow that.
<p/>In fact, you might say she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) scored off me proper, for I told her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) that no decent chap would ever look at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) again, and what does she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) answer?

<p/>And last week I caught up with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) again, as we was travelling by the same road, and I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hell's delights, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) the ugly truth about herself till she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could have strangled me if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'d been strong enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Cadworthy people have been a bit off us since Cora dropped Ned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div>declared Heathman.

<p/>'Twasn't her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fault, however.
<p/>Still, that's how it lies.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Head</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Head was examining this situation when the people began to come out of church.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) rose, therefore, and went his (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) way, while Heathman also departed.
<p/>Many returned to the outraged grave, but all was restored to order, and nothing remained to see.
<p/>CHAPTER VIII  Jack Head presently carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) notorious grievances to Humphrey Baskerville, and waited upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) one evening in summer time.
<p/>They had not met for many weeks, and Jack, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) found little leisure to mark the ways of other people at this season, could not fail to note a certain unwonted cheerfulness in the master of Hawk House.
<p/>Humphrey's saturnine spirit was at rest for the moment.
<p/>To-night he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) talked upon a personal topic, and found evident pleasure in a circumstance which, from the standpoint of his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) visitor, appeared exceedingly trivial.
<p/>The usual relations of these men seemed changed, and Mr. Baskerville showed the more reasonable and contented mind, while Jack displayed an active distrust of everything and everybody.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted a bit of a tell with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``and thought I might come over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in and welcome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>answered Humphrey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I see you pretty middling?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, well enough for that matter.
<p/>And you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never better.

 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div><p/>Jack sniffed and spat into the fire.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) took a pipe out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pocket, stuffed it, and lighted it before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was going to say that little things please little minds, but I won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) began.

<p/>There's no truckling in them.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'s no right to do things by halves, and one man's claim on that scamp, your brother, is just as lawful and proper as another man's; and because a person be poor or not poor don't make any difference in the matter of right and wrong.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For my part I've looked into the figures myself, and I quite agree with Nathan's friend.
<p/>None has a shadow of reason to question him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) or to ask for a penny from him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very easy to talk like that.

<p/>Close-fisted mully-grubs that you are!
<p/>And hark to this, Miser Baskerville, don't you pretend your nephew wants you to stand gossip for his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) bleating baby to pleasure you.

<p/>Who's like to care for you for yourself?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get along with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>answered Humphrey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You--of all men!
<p/>I could never have believed this--never.
<p/>And all for thirty-five pounds, fifteen and sevenpence!
<p/>So much for your wisdom and reason.
<p/>Be off and get down on your knees, if they'll bend, and ask God to forgive you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Head snorted and swore.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hat and departed in a towering rage.
<p/>Mr. Baskerville's anger lasted a shorter time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) walked to the window, threw it open, listened to Head's explosive departure and then, when silence was restored, Humphrey himself went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) doorstep and looked out upon the fair June night.
<p/>Mars and a moon nearly full sailed south together through unclouded skies, and beneath them lay, first, a low horizon, whose contour, smoothed by night's hand into dim darkness, showed neither point nor peak under the stars.
<p/>Beneath all, valley-born, there shone silver radiance of mist--dense and luminous in the moonlight.
<p/>Apparently quiescent, this vapour in truth drifted with ghostly proper motion before the night wind, and stole from the water-meadows upward toward the high places of the Moor.
<p/>Against these shifting passages of fog, laid along the skirts of forest and above the murmuring ways of a hidden river, ascended silhouettes of trees, all black and still against the pearly light behind them.
<p/>The vapour spread in wreaths and filaments of moisture intermingled.
<p/>Seen afar it was still as standing water; but to one moving beside it, the mist appeared as on a trembling loom where moonlight wove in ebony and silver.
<p/>The fabric broke, ravelled, fell asunder, and then built itself up once more.
<p/>Again it dislimned and shivered into separate shades that seemed to live.
<p/>From staple of streams, from the cold heart of a nightly river were the shadows born; and they writhed and worshipped--poor, heart-stricken spirits of the dew--love-mad for Selene on high.
<p/>Only when red Mars descended and the moon went down, did these forlorn phantoms of vapour shrink and shudder and lie closer, for comfort, to the water mother that bore them.
<p/>Hither, nigh midnight, in a frame of mind much out of tune with the nocturnal peace, passed Jack Head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) homeward way.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) loss had now become a sort of mental obsession, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) found it daily wax into a mightier outrage on humanity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) would have suffered in silence, but for the aggravation of these events whereby, from time to time, one or another of the wounded found his (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) ill fortune healed.
<p/>Examination might have showed an impartial mind that much method distinguished the process of this alleviation.
<p/>Those responsible for it clearly possessed close knowledge of the circumstances; and they used it to minister in turn to the chief sufferers.
<p/>The widows and fatherless were first indemnified; then others who least could sustain their losses.
<p/>A sane system marked the procedure; but not in the eyes of Mr. Head.
<p/>First, he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) disputed the right of any philanthropist to select and single out in such a matter, and next, when defeated in argument on that contention, he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) fell back upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) own disaster and endeavoured to show how his (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) misfortune was among the hardest and most ill-deserved.
<p/>That man after man should be compensated and himself ignored, roused Jack to a pitch of the liveliest indignation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) became a nuisance, and people fled from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) inevitable topic of speech.
<p/>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had heard Humphrey Baskerville upon the subject, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) as indifferent as the rest of the world.
<p/>The old man's argument still revolved in Jack's head and, too late, came answers to it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) moved along in the very extremity of rage, and Humphrey might have smarted to hear the things that his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) former friend thought against him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>).
<p/>Then, as ill chance willed, another came through the night and spoke to Head.
<p/>Timothy Waite went happily upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) homeward way and found himself in a mood as sweet as Jack's was the reverse.
<p/>For Timothy was love-making, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) lady's ripe experience enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) many pleasant hours of this amusement.
<p/>Neither was sentimental, but Cora, accustomed to the ways and fancies of the courting male, affected a certain amount of femininity, and Timothy appreciated this, and told himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) future wife possessed a woman's charms combined with a man's practical sense.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) was immensely elated at the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) had done, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) felt gratified to find that Miss Lintern made a most favourable impression amid his (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) friends and relations.
<p/>Now, moved thereto by his (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) own cheerful heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) gave Jack Head `good night' in a friendly tone of voice and added, <div class="bookquote">``A beautiful evening, sure enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div><p/>The way was overshadowed by trees and neither man recognised the other until Waite spoke.
<p/>Then Mr. Head, feeling himself within the atmosphere of a happy being, grunted a churlish answer and made himself known.
<p/>Thereon Timothy's manner changed and he (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) regretted his (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) amenity.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that Head?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) asked in an altered tone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know my voice, I suppose.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do.
<p/>I want to speak to you.
<p/>And I have meant to for some time past.
<p/>But the chance didn't offer, as you don't go to church, or any respectable place; and I don't frequent publics.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The other bristled instantly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the hell's the matter with you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) shouted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing's the matter with me.
<p/>But there's a lot the matter with you by all accounts, and since you can't keep a civil tongue in your head, it's time your betters took you in hand a bit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div><p/>Jack stared speechless at this blunt attack.
<p/>The moon whitened his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) lean jaw dropped and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) teeth glimmered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm damned!
<p/>`My betters'--eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; no need for any silly pretence with me.
<p/>You know what I think of your blackguard opinions and all that rot about equality and the rest.
<p/>I'm not here to preach to you; but I am here to tell you to behave yourself where ladies are concerned.
<p/>Miss Lintern has told me what you said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) complained sharply about it.
<p/>You may think it was very clever; but I'd have you to know it was very impertinent, coming from you to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>).
<p/>Why, if I'd been by, I'd have horsewhipped you.
<p/>And if it happens again, I will.
<p/>You're a lot too familiar with people, and seem to think you've a right to talk to everybody and anybody in a free and easy way--from parson downwards.
<p/>But let me tell you, you forget yourself.
<p/>I'd not have said these things if you'd been rude to any less person than the young lady I'm going to marry.
<p/>But that I won't stand, and I order you not to speak to Miss Lintern again.
<p/>Learn manners--that's what you've got to do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Waite/Mr. Waite</b></font>)</div><p/>Having uttered this admonition, Mr. Waite was proceeding but Jack stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I listened to you very patient,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you've got to listen to me, and listen you shall.
<p/>Why, God stiffen it, you bumbling fool!
<p/>who d'you think you are, and who d'you think any man is?
<p/>You be china to my cloam, I suppose?
<p/>And who was your grandfather?
<p/>Come now, speak up; who was he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to argue--I've told you what I wish you to do.
<p/>It doesn't matter who my grandfather was.
<p/>You know who I am, and that's enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div>said Jack; <div class="bookquote">``it's enough to make a toad laugh; but I don't laugh--no laughing matter to me to be told by a vain, puffed-up booby, like you, that I'm not good enough to have speech with people.
<p/>And that tousled bitch--there--and coming on what I've just heard!
<p/>If it don't make me sick with human nature and all the breed!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be sick with yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Waite/Mr. Waite</b></font>)</div>answered Timothy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to be too hard on an uneducated and self-sufficient man; but when it comes to insulting women, somebody must intervene.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>By way of answer the older man turned, walked swiftly to Waite and struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) on the breast.
<p/>The blow was a hard one and served its purpose.
<p/>Timothy hit back and Head closed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You blackguard anarchist,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>shouted the farmer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will have it, will you?
<p/>Then take it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div><p/>Jack found himself no match for a strong and angry man full twenty-five years his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) junior, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) reaped a very unpleasant harvest of blows, for the master of Coldstone carried an ash sapling and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had thrown Mr. Head to the ground he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) foot on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and flogged him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heartily without heeding where his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) strokes might fall.
<p/>Head yelled and cursed and tried to reach the other's legs and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) down.
<p/>A column of dust rose into the moonlight and Timothy's breath panted steaming upon the air.
<p/>Then, with a last cruel cut across the defeated labourer's shoulders, he (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) released him (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) and went his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) way.
<p/>But Head was soon up again and, with a bleeding face, a torn hand and a dusty jacket, he (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) followed his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) enemy.
<p/>Rage is shrewd of inspiration.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) remembered the one blow that he (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) could deal this man; and he (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) struck it, hoping that it might sink far deeper than the smarting surface-wounds that now made his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) own body ache.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Devil--coward--garotter!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) screamed out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You that hit old men in the dark--listen to me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Waite/Mr. Waite</b></font>)</div><p/>Waite stopped.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you want any more, you can have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't go telling lies around the country and saying I did anything you didn't well deserve.
<p/>You struck me first, and if you are mad enough to strike your betters, then you'll find they will strike back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll strike--yes, I'll strike--don't fear that.
<p/>I'll strike--a harder blow than your evil hand knows how.
<p/>I'll strike with truth--and that's a weapon goes deeper than your bully's stick.
<p/>Hear me, and hear a bit about your young lady--`young lady'!
<p/>A woman without a father--a child got--ax her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother where and how--and then go to blazing hell--you and your nameless female both.
<p/>I know--I know--and I'll tell you if you want to know.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)'s Nathan Baskerville's bastard--that's what your `young lady' is!
<p/>There's gall for yours.
<p/>There's stroke for stroke!
<p/>And see which of us smarts longest now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div><p/>Jack took his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) bruises homeward and the other, dazed at such a storm, also went his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) scoffed at such malice and put this evil thing behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hastened forward, as one hastens from sudden incidence of a foul smell.
<p/>But the wounded man had sped a poison more pestilential far than any born of physical cause.
<p/>The germ thus despatched grew while Waite slept; and with morning light its dimensions were increased.
<p/>Under the moon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) had laughed at this furious assault, and scorned it as the vile imagining of a beaten creature; but with daylight he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) laughed no longer.
<p/>The barb was fast; other rumours set floating after the innkeeper's death now hurtled like lesser arrows into his (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) bosom; and Mr. Waite felt that until a drastic operation was performed and these wounds cleansed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) peace of mind would not return.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) debated between the propriety of speaking to Cora about her (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) father, or to Mrs. Lintern on the subject of her (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) husband; and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) decided that the latter course would be more proper.
<p/>CHAPTER IX  Susan Hacker and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) master sat together in the kitchen.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) pipe; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) was clearing away the remains of a somewhat scanty meal, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) was grumbling loudly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) did so.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cried at length, <div class="bookquote">``or I won't show you the christening mug for Milly's baby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't see the end of this, but I can.

<p/>Humphrey puffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) pipe; Susan knitted, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) wooden needles tapped and rattled a regular tune.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was wondering whether the confession that she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) desired to make might be uttered at this auspicious moment.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) conscience tortured her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>); and it was the weight of a great misery on her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) mind, not the fact of giving up liquor, that had of late soured her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) temper.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had nearly strung herself to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) sins when he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>), from the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) being, spoke again.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) was scarcely conscious of a listener.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To think that a man like me--so dark and distrustful--to think that even such a man--I, that thought my heart was cracked for ever when my son died--I, that said to myself `no more, no more can any earthly thing fret you now.'

<p/>To think that the like of me must have some other thing to--to cherish and foster!
<p/>To think my shrivelled heart-strings could ever stretch and seek for aught to twine around again!

<p/>To mark their downward eye uplifted again; to note their fear for the future gone; to see hope creep back to 'em; to watch 'em walk cheerful and work cheerful; to know they laugh in their going once more; that they lie themselves down with a sigh of happiness and not of grief--ban't all that grander than their gratitude?
<p/>Gratitude must fade sooner or late, for the largest-hearted can't feel it for ever, try as he (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) may.

<p/>Susan's mind moved to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) purpose, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) knew that never again might fall so timely a moment.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) knitting, flung a peat on the fire, and spoke.

<p/>Mr. Baskerville heard a protracted mumble and finally, after some argument, Mrs. Hacker shut the door and returned into the kitchen with a man.
<p/>It was Jack himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) explained the reason for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) unduly late visit.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was anxious and troubled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I waited till 'twas past your hour for going to bed.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll have nought to say to you, Head--not a single word--until you make a solemn apology for your infernal impudence last time you stood here afore me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master of Hawk House, surveying his (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) visitor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So solemn as ever you like.
<p/>You was right and I was wrong, and I did ought to have been kicked from here to Cosdon Beacon and back for what I said to you.
<p/>We'm always punished for losing of our tempers.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which I will do, and here's my hand on it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other.
<p/>The old men shook hands and Susan wept.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) emotion was audible and Humphrey told her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) to go to bed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) refused.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm in this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) sniffed, wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) face, and then fetched a black bottle, some drinking water, and two glasses.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Light your pipe and say what you feel called upon to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>concluded Humphrey to Mr. Head.
<p/>'''Tis like this,'' answered the other.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Every man wants to boss somebody in this world.
<p/>That's a failing of human nature, and if we ain't strong enough to lord it over a fellow-creature, we try to reign over a hoss or even a dog.

<p/>Well, long since I marked that, and then, thanks to my understanding and sense, I comed to see--or I may have read it--that 'twas greater far to lord it over yourself than any other created thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And harder far,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Without doubt you'm right.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care nothing about that nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div>answered Jack; <div class="bookquote">``and, knowing my opinions, there ain't no call to drag the Lord in.
<p/>All I do know is that my hard-earned savings went, and--and--well, I got my monkey up about it, and I got out of hand.
<p/>Yes, I got out of hand.
<p/>The awful shock of losing my thirty-five pounds odd took me off my balance.
<p/>For a bit I couldn't stand square against it, and I did some vain things, and just sank to be a common, everyday fool, like most other people.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div><p/>'''Tis a good thing you can see it, for `twill end by righting your opinion of yourself.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My opinion of myself was a thought too high.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For the moment I was adrift--but only for the moment.
<p/>Now I've come back to my common-sense and my high ideas, I can assure you.

<p/>Enough I had on my mind to make me do 'em, too.
<p/>But I won't excuse 'em.
<p/>I'll say, out and out, that they were very wrong.
<p/>You've agreed to overlook one of those things, and you say you'll forgive me for talking a lot of rubbish against you, for which I'm terrible sorry.
<p/>So that's all right, and no lasting harm there.
<p/>But t`other job's worse.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div><p/>Jack stopped for breath, and Susan sighed from the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) immense bosom.
<p/>Humphrey poured out some gin and water for his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) guest.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) helped himself more sparingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To drink under this roof is to be forgiven.
<p/>Now I'll go on with my tale, and tell you about the second piece of work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) related how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had left Hawk House in wrath, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had met with Timothy Waite; how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been reproved and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had hit back both with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fists and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) tongue.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knocked me down and gave me the truth of music with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heavy stick.

<p/>'Twas a double offence against right-doing, because I'd promised Susan here not to let it out, and because to tell Waite, of all men, was a cowardly deed against the girl, seeing he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) meant to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>But I'd quarrelled with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) already, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) I did; and now I tell you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) drank and stared into the fire.
<p/>For some time Humphrey did not reply; but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) opinion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It all depends on the sort of chap that Waite may prove to be.

<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) do, then 'tis his (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) character and opinions will decide him (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>).
<p/>For his (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) own sake we'll trust he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>)'ll throw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) off, for woe betide the man that marries her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) better than her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) havage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>)'ll go his (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) way and care nothing.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) looks at it different, and thinks the matter can't rest there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>)'ll go further.
<p/>For my part I can't say I care much about it.
<p/>All I know is that Priscilla Lintern has rare virtues, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) weren't virtuous, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>)'ve lived on no bed of roses, for all the brave way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) stands up for my late brother.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) told me--or when I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>)--I made it plain that in my opinion this ought to be known.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) stood for the children, not herself, and said it never must be known for their sakes.
<p/>Well, now we shall see who hears it next.
<p/>As for you two, you've got your consciences, and it ban't for me to come between you and them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I've told my story, and admitted my failings like a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div>said Jack, <div class="bookquote">``and, having done so, I can do no more.

<p/>CHAPTER X  A jay, with flash of azure and rose, fluttered screaming along from point to point of a coppice hard by Hawk House, and Cora Lintern saw it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) frowned, for this bird was associated in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind with a recent and an unpleasant incident.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother Heathman, whose disparate nature striking against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own produced many explosions, had recently told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that the jay was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bird--showy, tuneless, hard-hearted.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) remembered the occasion of this attack, but for the moment had no energy at leisure with which to hate him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); for difficulties were rampant in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own path, and chance began to treat her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) much as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had treated other people in the past.
<p/>In a word, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lover grew colder.
<p/>As yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no knowledge of the reason, but the fact could not be denied, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) uneasiness increased.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) saw somewhat less of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) made no effort to determine the time of the wedding.
<p/>Neither did he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) invite her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to do so.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had come twice to see Mrs. Lintern when Cora was not by, and an account of these visits was reported by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) mother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't exactly know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) dropped in either time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lintern</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Lintern.

<p/>Yet there was plenty on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) mind, I do believe.
<p/>I should reckon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>)'d come for a special purpose, but finding himself here, it stuck in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) throat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>)'s strong with men, but weak with women.
<p/>Have he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) told you of aught that's fretting him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) daughter could remember nothing of the sort.
<p/>Neither did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) confess what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) did know--that Waite was unquestionably cooler than of old.
<p/>'''Tis time the day was named,'' declared Priscilla.

 (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>But Cora did not do so, because there was much in Timothy's manner that told her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) desired no expedition.
<p/>Some time had now elapsed since last she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>), and to-day she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) was going, in obedience to a note brought by a labourer, to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) at the Rut, half a mile from Coldstone Farm.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) should have thus invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) was typical of the change in his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) sentiments.
<p/>Formerly he (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) would have walked or ridden to her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>).
<p/>The tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) brief note chilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) obeyed it, and was now approaching their tryst at evening time in early September.
<p/>In a little field nigh Hawk House she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) heard the purr of a corn-cutting machine.
<p/>It was clinking round and round, shearing at each revolution a slice from the island of oats that still stood in the midst of a sea of fallen grain.
<p/>A boy drove the machine, and behind it followed Humphrey Baskerville and Rupert.
<p/>The younger man had come over to help garner the crop.
<p/>Together they worked, gathered up the oats, and set them in little sheaves.
<p/>The waning sunlight gilded the standing oats.
<p/>Now and then a dog barked and darted round the vanishing island in the midst, for there--separated from safety by half an acre of stubble--certain rabbits squatted together, and waited for the moment when they must bolt and make their final run to death.
<p/>Cora, unseen, watched this spectacle; then Mrs. Hacker appeared with a tray, on which were three mugs and a jug of cider.
<p/>The girl was early for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) appointment, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sauntered forward presently and marked Timothy Waite in the lower part of the valley.
<p/>It was the Rut's tamest hour of late summer, for the brightness of the flowers had ceased to shine; the scanty heath made little display, and autumn had as yet lighted no beacon fire.
<p/>Stunted thorn trees ripened their harvest, but the round masses of the greater furze were dim; a prevalent and heavy green spread over the Rut, and the only colour contrast was that presented by long stretches of dead brake fern.
<p/>The litter had been cut several weeks before and allowed to dry and ripen.
<p/>It had now taken upon itself a dark colour, widely different from the richer, more lustrous, and gold-sprinkled splendour of auburn that follows natural death.
<p/>The dull brown stuff was being raked together ready for the cart; and Cora, from behind a furze clump, watched her (<font color='blue'><b>masses</b></font>) sweetheart carry immense trusses of the bracken and heave them up to the growing pile upon a wain that waited for the load.
<p/>All she (<font color='blue'><b>masses</b></font>) could see was a pair of straight legs in black gaiters moving under a little stack of the fern; then the litter was lifted, to reveal Timothy Waite.
<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) watch and marked that the time of meeting was nearly come.
<p/>Whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) donned his (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) coat, made tidy his (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) neckcloth, handed his (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) fork to a labourer, and left the working party.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) strolled slowly up the coomb along the way that she (<font color='blue'><b>masses</b></font>) must approach, while she (<font color='blue'><b>masses</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>masses</b></font>) hiding-place and set out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) shook hands, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) did not kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>masses</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) did not look into her (<font color='blue'><b>masses</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) evaded her (<font color='blue'><b>masses</b></font>) own glance, spoke quickly, and walked quickly in unconscious obedience to his (<font color='blue'><b>Waite</b></font>) own mental turmoil.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't run,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>masses</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you want me to hear what you're saying, Timothy, you must go slower, or else sit down in the hedge.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's terrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's terrible, and it's made an old man of me.
<p/>But some things you seem to know from the first are true, and some you seem to know are not.
<p/>And when first I heard it I said to myself, t 'Tis a damned lie of a wicked and venomous man'; but then, with time and thought, and God knows how many sleepless nights, I got to see 'twas true enough.
<p/>And why wasn't I told?
<p/>I ask you that.
<p/>Why wasn't I told?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart sank and her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head grew giddy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) translated this speech with lightning intuition, and knew too well all that it must mean.
<p/>It explained his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) increasing coolness, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) absences and evasions.
<p/>It signified that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mind upon learning the secret of the Linterns.
<p/>A natural feminine, histrionic instinct made her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pretend utmost astonishment, though she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doubted whether it would deceive him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What you're talking about I haven't the slightest idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you have a grievance, so have I--and more than one.
<p/>You wasn't used to order me here and there six weeks ago.
<p/>'Twas you that would come and see me then; now I've got to weary my legs to tramp to do your bidding.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) paid no heed to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) protest.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't understand, then you must, and before we part, too.
<p/>I can't go on like this.
<p/>No living man could do it.
<p/>I called twice to see your mother about it, for it seemed to me that 'twas more seemly I should speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) than to you; but when I faced her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) I couldn't open my mouth, much as I wanted to do so.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shook me almost, and I'd have been thankful to be shook; but 'tis the craft and cunning of the thing that's too much for me.
<p/>I've been hoodwinked in this, and no doubt laughed at behind my back.
<p/>That's what's made me feel as I do now.
<p/>I waited and hoped on, and loved you for years, and saw you chuck two other men, and found I'd got you at last, and reckoned I was well rewarded for all my patience; and--then--then--this--''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?

<p/>What sin have I committed?
<p/>Don't think I'm blind.
<p/>I've seen you cooling off clear enough, and for the life of me I couldn't guess the reason, try as I would and sorrow about it as I would.
<p/>But since you've ordered me here for this, perhaps you'll go straight on and tell me what's all the matter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to answer me one question.
<p/>The answer you must know, and I ask you to swear afore your Maker that you'll tell me the truth.
<p/>Mind this, I know the truth.
<p/>It's scorched into me like a burn this many a day.
<p/>But I must hear it from you too, Cora.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) guessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) question, and also guessed that in truth lay her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) last hope.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) spoke positively, and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) doubted not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) knew.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) fear before her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mother was natural.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) perceived how easily a man might have gone to a woman with this momentous question on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, and how naturally the presence of the woman might strike him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dumb at the actual meeting.
<p/>None knew better than Cora how different is the reality of a conversation with a fellow-creature from the imaginary interview formulated before the event.
<p/>There was but one problem in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind now--the advantage or disadvantage of truth.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) judged that the case was desperate, but that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only hope lay in honesty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I swear I'll answer nought but the truth--if I know the truth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) hesitated, and considered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) was fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) still, but the circumstance of this deception, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a party, had gone far to shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) affection.
<p/>The grievance was that the facts should have been hidden from him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) after his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) proposal.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) held that then was the time when Cora's paternity should have been divulged.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) believed that had he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) known it then, it would have made small difference to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) love.
<p/>It was not so much the fact as the hiding of the fact that had troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was your father?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked at length, and the words burst out of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in a heap, like an explosion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know who he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) answered.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, Timothy, you never asked.
<p/>I often thought whether there was any reason to tell you, and often and often I felt you ought to know; but you're a wise and far-seeing man, and I wasn't the only one to be thought on.
<p/>I'd have told you from the first, even at the risk of angering you, but there was mother.
<p/>I couldn't do it--knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d feel.

<p/>I didn't learn it from Heathman.

<p/>If you hadn't quarrelled with a certain man I shouldn't have done so either.
<p/>Jack Head told me after I'd thrashed him (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) for insulting you; and I suppose if he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) hadn't I might have gone to church with you, and very likely gone to my grave at last, and never known what you was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``D'you swear that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you it is so.
<p/>I'm going to swear no more at your bidding.
<p/>'Tis for me to speak now.
<p/>You've cut me to the quick to-day, and I doubt if I shall ever get over it.
<p/>'Tisn't a very manly way to treat an innocent girl, I should think.
<p/>However, I forgive everything and always shall, for I love the ground you walk on, and you know it, and 'twasn't from any wish to treat you without proper respect that I hid away this cruel thing.
<p/>I said to myself, `It can't hurt dear Tim not to know it, and it would hurt my mother and my sister terribly if 'twas known.'
<p/>So, right or wrong, I did what I did; and now you're in judgment over me, and I can't--I can't live another moment, dear Timothy, till I know how you feel about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had begun in a spirit rather dictatorial, but changed swiftly into this milder appeal when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) marked the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) was prepared to stand little.
<p/>From the first she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt almost hopeless that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have power to move him (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who told Jack Head?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Waite/Mr. Waite</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Timothy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``God knows.
<p/>My brother, I should think.
<p/>There's none else in the world but mother and Phyllis that knew it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Others were told, but not me.
<p/>I was deceived by all of you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not true,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) answered as her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) fighting instinct got the better of tact.
<p/>'''Twasn't to deceive you not to tell you.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did wrong to me.

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Perceiving what had hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), Cora set herself to lessen the sting as much as possible; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) failed.
<p/>They talked to no purpose for an hour, while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) used every argument that occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) opposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) swift mind and subtle reasoning a blank, impassive wall of sulky anger and wounded pride.
<p/>It began to grow dark before the conclusion came, and they had walked half-way back to Shaugh.
<p/>At the top of the hill he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and the battle ended in wrath on both sides and a parting irrevocable.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) failure it was that made Cora lose her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) temper, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>), thankful for the excuse, spoke harshly, and absolved his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) own uneasy spirit for so doing.
<p/>The final scene was brief, and the woman, wearied in mind and body with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) efforts to propitiate him (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>), drew it down upon them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you speak out like a man, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said at last.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why d'you keep growling in your throat, like a brute, and not answering my questions?
<p/>'Tis because you can't answer them in right and justice.
<p/>But one word you've got to find a tongue to, though well you may be shamed to do it.
<p/>It shan't be said I've thrown you over, if that's the cowardly thing you're playing up for.
<p/>I promised to marry you, and I would marry you; but you don't want to marry me, it seems, and you've pitched on this paltry thing to get out of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>''`Paltry thing'!
<p/>You're shameless.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is paltry; and everybody would say so; and you'll hear what decent people think of you pretty soon if you throw me over, I can tell you.
<p/>How can a child help its own father, or see whether its parents be properly married?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll see, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you're bent on hearing me speak, I will.
<p/>And don't pretend as I'm growling and you're not hearing.
<p/>I'll tell you what I mean, and my words shall be as clear as my mind is about it.
<p/>I won't marry you now, and I wouldn't if you was all you ought to be.
<p/>I've had a taste of your tongue this evening that's opened my mind a good bit to what you are.
<p/>You've shown me a lot more about yourself than you think for.
<p/>And if I did growl, like a brute, my ears was open and my wits was wide awake, like a man.

<p/>And don't you think you've heard the last of this, because you have not.
<p/>I've got good friends and strong friends in the world, though you'd like to fancy as I was friendless and outcast, for men like you to spit on.
<p/>But I can fight my own battles very well, come to that, as you shall find; and I'll have you up for breach, God's my judge; and if decent men don't bring in proper, terrifying damages against you, I'll ask you to forgive me.
<p/>Yes, I'll make your name laughed at from one end of the Moor to t`other, as you shall find afore you'm many days older.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) stood still before this threat, and, finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) did not answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) and hastened home.
<p/>There she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) blazed her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) startling news.
<p/>Cora's own attitude towards the truth was now one of indifference.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) raged against her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) fate, and for the time being could not look forward.
<p/>Phyllis alone displayed grief.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) was engaged to a young baker at Cornwood, and feared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) own romance: therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) wept and revealed the liveliest concern.
<p/>But Heathman, perceiving Priscilla's indifference, exhibited the like.
<p/>It appeared that mother and son were glad rather than regretful at this escape of truth.
<p/>Mrs. Lintern, however, exhibited exceeding wonder, if little dismay.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) was sorry for Cora, but not for herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a feeling, strong as death in me, that `twould come to light,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Somehow I always knew that the thing must struggle out sometime.
<p/>Many and many actually knew it in their hearts, by a sort of understanding--like a dog's reason.
<p/>And I knew they knew it.
<p/>But the truth was never openly thrust in my face till he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) died, and Eliza Gollop spoke it.
<p/>And, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) being what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) is, none believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>); and 'twas enough that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) should whisper scandal for the better sort to flout her (<font color='blue'><b>Gollop</b></font>) and turn a deaf ear.
<p/>And now it's out, and the great wonder in me ban't that 'tis out, but who let it out.
<p/>For the moment it looks as if 'twas a miracle; yet, no doubt, time will clear that too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you'll go now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cora/Cora Lintern/Lintern</b></font>)</div>said Cora.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyway, if you don't, I shall.
<p/>There's been nought but trouble and misery for me in this hole from my childhood upward.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cadworthy/Cadworthy Farm</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XI  There visited Cadworthy Farm, on a Sunday afternoon, Priscilla Lintern with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) son and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) younger daughter.
<p/>They came unexpectedly, though Rupert had told Heathman they would not be unwelcome.
<p/>May was from home, and the business of preparing tea fell upon Milly Baskerville.
<p/>Phyllis helped Rupert's wife in this operation, and while they were absent in the kitchen and the men went to the farm, Hester and Priscilla spoke together.
<p/>The one discussed her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) son, the other her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) daughter and herself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been coming over to see you this longful time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Baskerville, <div class="bookquote">``but what with the weather and--and--''   (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Baskerville</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The things that are being said, perhaps?''

<p/>My son's terrible pleased that it have got out; and the young man who is going to marry Phyllis don't mean to alter his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plans.
<p/>And your brother is glad also, I suppose, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished it.
<p/>But to Cora, this business of being flung over hit her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) very hard, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) wanted to bring an action for breach of promise against Timothy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) went to see Mr. Popham about it; only he (<font color='blue'><b>Popham</b></font>) didn't seem to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>)'d get much, and advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) to do no such thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Natural enough.

<p/>It looks as if it might go through this time, though I can't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) really married after all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) adventures with the maidens.
<p/>'Tis the daughter of the livery-stable keeper at Tavistock.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s the only one--and King--that's her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father's name--worships the ground she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) goes on.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)'s there to-day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Lintern nodded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's May?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>) asked.

 (<font color='red'><b>Milly/Milly Luscombe/Luscombe</b></font>)</div><p/>Milly brought the tea at this moment and called Heathman and Rupert, who were smoking in the farmyard.
<p/>They appeared, and Milly's baby was carried to join the company.
<p/>Rupert showed the cup that his (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) godfather had given to the child.
<p/>The Baskervilles made it clear that they designed no change in their relations with Mrs. Lintern.
<p/>A sharp estrangement had followed Ned's jilting, but that belonged to the past.
<p/>Amity reigned, and Milly expressed regret at Mrs. Lintern's determination to leave Shaugh Prior in the following spring.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll both be gone--both girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Milly</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``and Heathman here haven't got no need of a wife yet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) says, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) and I shall find a smaller and a cheaper place than Undershaugh.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Third time's lucky, they say.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Milly/Milly Luscombe/Luscombe</b></font>)</div><p/>''`Twill be the fourth time,'' corrected Milly.
<p/>They ate and drank, and spoke on general subjects; then the Linterns prepared to start, and Priscilla uttered a final word to Hester before the younger people.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you for letting the past go.
<p/>There was but few mattered to me, and you were the first of them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Baskervilles</b></font>)</div><p/>They departed, and the Baskervilles talked about them.
<p/>Behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) back, they spoke gently of Priscilla, and old Mrs. Baskerville revealed even a measure of imagination in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) speech.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The worst was surely after he (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) sank into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) grave and the storm broke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hester/Hester Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Hester.

<p/>To think that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ear had to hear, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart had to break, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mouth had to be dumb.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four brave boys--one on sea and three on land.

<p/>I mean Tommy Gollop and that other old rip, Joe Voysey.
<p/>Both have got the sack!
<p/>The reverend Masterman have hit out right and left and floored the pair of 'em.

<p/>Anyway, all be in the fair way to have their money again.
<p/>And I asked Lawyer Popham long ago, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) came to Cadworthy, who 'twas, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawyer</b></font>) wouldn't say; but had no doubt we could guess.
<p/>And then I asked Susan Hacker, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) wouldn't say, but yet came so near saying that there was little left to know.
<p/>And to-day I tackled Uncle Humphrey and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) no peace till 'twas out.

<p/>I got that out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) too.
<p/>But I've solemnly promised not to tell Rupert.

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A useful old fairy, and no mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div>laughed Heathman.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) said that very thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered May, <div class="bookquote">``and Susan said the same.

<p/>Then came Humphrey Baskerville, and for love of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) brother and for love of the name, did these good deeds.
<p/>And to beggar himself in money be nought in the eyes of that man, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family rich in credit afore the eyes of the world.
<p/>Such another was your own father, May; and such another is your brother Rupert; and such another was your cousin Mark.
<p/>They had their own sight and looked at the world their own way and all saw it different, maybe; but they never saw justice different.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And such be I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div>declared Heathman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't call myself a Baskerville, and shan't get no thinner for that; but I'm the son of my mother, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s worth a shipload of any other sort--better than the whole flight of you Baskervilles, May--good though you be.
<p/>And I'm very well pleased to be kin to you all, if you like, and if you don't like, you can leave it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They parted then, and May returned home.
<p/>Heathman showed himself highly gratified at what he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had heard, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sister shared his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) satisfaction.
<p/>But their mother was sunk deep in the hidden places of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own heart, and they left her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) alone while they spoke together.
<p/>CHAPTER XII  Joe Voysey walked over one evening to talk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>) lifelong friend Thomas Gollop.
<p/>The gardener felt choked to the throat with injustice, and regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) dismissal from the vicarage as an outrage upon society; while Mr. Gollop laboured under similar emotions.
<p/>Both declared that the ingratitude of Dennis Masterman was what principally stung them.
<p/>To retire into private life caused them no pain; but to have been invited to do so was a bitter grievance.
<p/>Miss Eliza Gollop chanced to be out, and Thomas sat by the fire alone.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) Bible stood on the table, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was not reading it.
<p/>Only when Voysey's knock sounded at the cottage door did Thomas wheel round from the fire, open the book and appear to be buried in its pages.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had rather expected a visit from Mr. Masterman, hence these preparations; but when Voysey entered, Thomas modified his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) devout attitude and shut the Bible again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I half thought as that wretched man from the vicarage might call this evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) went to a cupboard and brought out a bottle of spirits.

<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>Voysey</b></font>) had gone the brother and sister debated long, and Thomas gave it as his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) opinion that it would be well for them to leave Shaugh and end their days in a more Christian and congenial atmosphere.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIII  At the approach of another Christmas, Humphrey Baskerville stood in the churchyard of St. Edward's and watched two masons lodge the stone that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had raised to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) brother Nathan.
<p/>It conformed to the usual pattern of the Baskerville memorials, and was of slate.
<p/>The lettering had been cut deep and plain without addition of any ornament.
<p/>The accidental severity and simplicity of the stone contrasted to advantage with Vivian's ornate and tasteless marble beside it.
<p/>Dennis Masterman walked across the churchyard presently and, seeing Humphrey, turned and approached.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad you've put a slate here.
<p/>I like them better than these garish things.
<p/>They are more suited to this grey Moor world of ours.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>'''Tis a foolish waste to spend money on the dead,'' answered Mr. Baskerville.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When all the living be clothed and fed, then we can fling away our money over graves.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've a right to speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>said the clergyman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To praise you would be an impertinence; but as the priest of Him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) we both worship, I rejoice to think of what you have done to clear the clouded memory of this man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey/Humphrey Baskerville/HUMPHREY BASKERVILLE</b></font>)</div><p/>Humphrey took no verbal notice of these remarks.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) shoulders and spoke of the gravestone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll thank you to read what I've put over him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>), and say whether 'tis not right and just.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The other obeyed.
<p/>After particulars of Nathan's age and the date of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) death, there followed only the first verse of the forty-first Psalm--  <div class="bookquote">``Blessed is he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) that considereth the poor: the Lord will deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) in time of trouble.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nathan/Nathan Baskerville/Mr. Nathan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>explained Mr. Baskerville, <div class="bookquote">``my brother did consider the poor--and none else.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) made a botch of it, along of bad judgment and too much hope and too much trust in himself, is neither here nor there; for I hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) point of view was well-meaning though mistaken.
<p/>If we see a man's point of view, it often leads--I won't say to mercy, for that's no business of ours in my opinion--but to the higher justice.
<p/>To judge by results is worldly sense, but I'm doubtful if 'tis heavenly sense.
<p/>Anyway, that's how I feel about my brother now, though 'twas only brought home to me after a year of thinking; and as for the end of the text, certainly that happened, because none can doubt the Lord delivered him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) in the time of trouble.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) death was a deliverance, as every death must be, but none more than Nathan's afore the tempest broke.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Masterman--knowing as little as the other what Nathan's death had brought to Nathan of mental agony before the end--conceded these points freely.
<p/>They walked together in the churchyard and spoke of moral topics and religious instruction.
<p/>At a point in the enclosure, the younger stopped and indicated a space remote from the lodges of the silent people.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You design to lie here--is it not so?
<p/>Gollop, I remember, told me, a long time ago now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man regarded the spot indifferently and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant it once--not now.
<p/>We change our most fixed purposes under the battering of the world; and small enough our old thoughts often look, when seen again, after things have happened and years have passed.
<p/>I'll creep to join my own, if you please.
<p/>They won't mind, I reckon, if I sink into the pit beside 'em.
<p/>I'll go by my wife and my son and my brothers.
<p/>We'll all rise and brave the Trump together, as well as erring man may.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>The stone was set in its place presently and Mr. Baskerville, well pleased with the result, set off homeward.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) tethered pony stood at the gate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) mounted and went slowly up the hill.
<p/>CHAPTER XIV  <div class="bookquote">``Some say they believe the old saying and some say they don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>declared Mr. Abraham Elford to a thin bar at six o'clock on Christmas Eve; <div class="bookquote">``but for my part I know what I've proved to be true with my own eyes, and I will stick to it that apples picked at wane of moon do shrivel and scrump up cruel.

 (<font color='red'><b>Abraham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you swear that you've proved that?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't I tell you that I've proved it?
<p/>Pick your apples when the moon be first horning, that's my advice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They wrangled upon the question, and missed its real interest as an example of the value of evidence and the influence of superstition and individual idiosyncrasy on all human testimony.
<p/>Jack scoffed, Abraham Elford grew warm; for who is there that can endure to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Elford</b></font>) depositions brushed aside as worthless?
<p/>Upon this great topic of the shrinking of apples at wane of moon, some sided with Mr. Head; while others, who held lunar influence as a force reaching into dark mysteries of matter and mind, supported the publican.
<p/>The contention was brisk, and not until it began to interfere with the nightly sale of his (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) liquor, did Elford awake to its danger and stop it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) conceded nothing, but declared the argument must cease.
<p/>'''Tis Christman Eve,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and no occasion for any short words or sharp sayings.
<p/>Me and Head both know that we'm right, and mountains wouldn't move either of us from our opinions, so let it be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) lifted a great earthen pot from the fire in the bar parlour.
<p/>It contained cider with pieces of toast floating in it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty drinking, as I'm certain sure that one and all of you will say,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>foretold the host.
<p/>Apples, however, rose again to be first topic of conversation before this fine wassail, and Jack spoke once more.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Time was, down to the in country, that on this night--or else Old Christman Eve, I forget which--we gawks should all have marched out solemn to the orchards and sung lucky songs, and poured out cider, and fired our guns into the branches, and made all-round heathen fools of ourselves.
<p/>And why?
<p/>Because 'twas thought that to do so improved the next year's crop a thousandfold!
<p/>And when we remember that 'twas no further back than our fathers that they did such witless things, it did ought to make us feel humble, I'm sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk no more about cider, drink it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div>said Heathman Lintern, who was of the company.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drink it while 'tis hot, and `twill warm your bones and soften your opinions.
<p/>You'm so peart to-night and so sharp at the corners, that I reckon you've got your money back at last.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Head</b></font>)</div><p/>This direct attack reduced Mr. Head to a less energetic and dogmatic frame of mind.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not, and I happen to know that I never shall.
<p/>Me and the old chap fell out, and I dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) down too sharp.
<p/>I was wrong, and I've since admitted it, for I'm the rare, fearless sort that grant I'm wrong the first minute it can be proved against me.
<p/>Though when a man's built on that large pattern, you may be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ban't wrong very often.
<p/>'Tis only the peddling, small creatures that won't admit they're mistaken--out of a natural fear that if they once allow it, they'll never be thought right again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We made out that the sporting old blade had dropped upwards of six thousand over this job, and we was wondering how much that is out of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s got.''

<p/>Susan offered an old coat to a tramp once, thinking to get it away afore Baskerville missed it; and the tramp looked it over--through and through, you might say--and he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) thanked Susan as saucy as you please, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) that when he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) was going to set up for a mommet-LSB-1-RSB- he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>)'d let her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) know, but `twouldn't be yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rupert/Rupert Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Rupert Baskerville came in at this moment and saw Heathman.
<p/>Both were in Dennis Masterman's carol choir, and it was time that they gathered with the rest at the vicarage, for a long round of singing awaited them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A mild night and the roads pretty passable,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) announced.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're away in half an hour wi' books and lanterns; but no musickers be coming with us, like in the good old days.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Masterman</b></font>) stopped to drink, and the sight of Jack Head reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) of a commission.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come out in the ope-way for half a moment.''

<p/>Rupert was laughing, Mr. Head exhibited the liveliest excitement.
<p/>In one hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) waved three ten-pound notes; with the other he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) chinked some gold and silver.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Money!

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) shouted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If that baggering old hero haven't paid me after all!

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>They congratulated him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) and liquor flowed.
<p/>Head was full of rejoicing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) even exhibited gratitude.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might say 'twas no more than justice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) began; <div class="bookquote">``but I tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>)'s more than just--he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>)'s a very generous old man, and nobody can deny it, and I for one would like to do something to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They considered the possible ways of bringing any satisfaction to Humphrey Baskerville, but could hit on no happy project.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If us could only do something that meant a lot of different chaps all of one mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div>said Heathman.

 (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div><p/>Then came an interruption in the shape of Dennis Masterman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is too bad, you fellows!''

<p/>A sudden and violent explosion from Mr. Head made the clergyman nearly choke in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) drinking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Jack so loudly that the company started.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) leg at the same moment and then danced with exaggerated rejoicing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Got what?
<p/>D.T.'s?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Heathman/Heathman Lintern</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Heathman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go up along to Hawk House!
<p/>I beg and pray your reverence to go there first of all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div>urged Jack.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely 'tis the very thing.
<p/>'Tis just what we was trying to light upon--summat that meant the showing of general friendship--summat that meant a bit of trouble and thought taken for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)--all your blessed Christmas vartues put together--goodwill and all the rest of it.
<p/>If you was to steal up through the garden by the greenside and then burst forth like one man--why, there 'tis!
<p/>Who can deny 'tis a noble idea?
<p/>And you can go and holler to the quality afterwards.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good for you, Jack!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rupert/Rupert Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>answered Rupert.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I say ditto with all my heart if Mr. Masterman--''   (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dennis/Masterman/Dennis Masterman</b></font>)</div>interrupted Dennis.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The night will be gone before we start.
<p/>We'll go to Hawk House right away.
<p/>I can't gainsay such a wish, though it's a mile out of the beat we had planned.
<p/>Come!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The clergyman</b></font>)</div><p/>The clergyman, with Rupert Baskerville and Heathman Lintern, hurried off, and a few of the younger men, accompanied by Jack Head, followed after them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must just pop in my house and lock up this dollop of money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div>said Jack; <div class="bookquote">``then us'll go up over with the singers to see how the old Hawk takes it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hawk</b></font>)'ll be scared first; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawk</b></font>)'ll try to look as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawk</b></font>) was going to fling brickbats out of the windows, or set the dogs at us; and all the time we shall very well know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawk</b></font>)'s bubbling over with surprise to find what a number of respectable people have got to thinking well of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hawk</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Head</b></font>)</div><p/>The crowd of men and boys moved on ahead of Jack and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) friends.
<p/>The shrill cries and laughter of the youngsters and a bass rumble of adult voices wakened night, and a dozen lanterns flashed among the company as they ascended into the silent darkness of Dartmoor.
<p/>CHAPTER XV  Humphrey Baskerville had hoped that his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) nephew might visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) on Christmas Eve; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) learned that it was impossible, because Rupert had joined the carol-singers, and would be occupied with them on a wide circle of song.
<p/>After dark he (<font color='blue'><b>Rupert</b></font>) sat alone until near seven o'clock; then Mrs. Hacker returned home and they took their supper together.
<p/>The meal ended, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) cleared it away and settled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hacker</b></font>) knitting.
<p/>Talk passed between them not unmarked by sentiment, for it concerned the past and related to those changes the year had brought.
<p/>On the following day Humphrey was to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) Christmas dinner at Cadworthy, and Susan hoped to spend the festival with friends in Shaugh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got Heathman and his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) mother to be of the company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Baskerville.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The daughters are both about their own business, and one goes to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sweetheart, and Cora's down to Plymouth, so we shall escape from them and no harm done.
<p/>But Heathman and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) mother will be there.
<p/>They are rather a puzzle to me, Susan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) replied.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll go on puzzling yourself over this party or that till you've puzzled yourself into the workhouse.
<p/>Haven't you paid all the creditors to the last penny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's where it lies.
<p/>A man's children and their mother are his (<font color='blue'><b>Cora</b></font>) first creditors, I should reckon.
<p/>They've got first call in justice, if not in law.
<p/>I judge that there's a fine bit of duty there, and the way they look at life--so much my own way 'tis--makes me feel--  I wrote to that bad Cora yesterday.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s working hard, I'm told.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Hacker/Hacker</b></font>)</div><p/>Susan sniffed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So does the Devil,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) said.
<p/>'''Tis all very well for you, I suppose; because when you wake up some morning and discover as you've got nought left in the world but your night-shirt, you'll go about to them you've befriended to seek for your own again--and lucky you'll be if you find it, or half of it; but what of me?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll never want,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) declared.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're the sort always to fall on your feet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So's young Lintern for that matter.
<p/>No need to worry about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>)'s a lesson, if you like.
<p/>The man to be contented whatever haps.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it.
<p/>I've marked it.
<p/>I've learnt no little from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lintern</b></font>).
<p/>A big heart and a mighty power of taking life as it comes without fuss.
<p/>There's a bad side to it, however, as well as a good.
<p/>I've worked that out.
<p/>It's good for a man to be contented, but no good for the place he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lives in.
<p/>Contented people never stir up things, or throw light into dark corners, or let air into stuffy places.
<p/>Content means stagnation so oft as not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They mind their own business, however.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They mostly do; and that's selfish wisdom so oft as not.
<p/>Now Jack Head's never content, and never will be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't name that man on Christmas Eve!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hacker</b></font>)</div><p/>said Mrs. Hacker testily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) any day of the week, for that matter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and the east wind both be useful, little as you like 'em.
<p/>For my part, I've been a neighbour to the east wind all my life and shared its quality in the eyes of most folk--till now.
<p/>But the wind of God be turning out of the east for me, Susan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So long as you be pleased with yourself--  And as for content, 'tisn't a vartue, 'tis an accident, like red hair or bow legs.
<p/>You can't get it, nor yet get away from it, by taking thought.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) nodded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're in the right there.
<p/>One man will make more noise if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scratches his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger than another if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breaks his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg.
<p/>'Tis part of the build of the mind, and don't depend on chance.
<p/>Same with misery--that's a matter of character, not condition, I know men that won't be wretched while they can draw their breath; and some won't be happy, though they've got thrice their share of good fortune.
<p/>No doubt that's how Providence levels up, and gives the one what he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) can't enjoy, to balance him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) with the other, who's got nought, but who's also got the blessed power of making happiness out of nought.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've found the middle way, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and, like others who think they're on the sure road to happiness, you be pushing along too fast.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Running myself out of breath--eh?
<p/>But you're wrong.
<p/>I'm too cautious for that.
<p/>If I'm a miser, as the people still think here and there, then 'tis for peace I'm a miser.
<p/>'Twas always peace of mind that I hungered and hankered for, yet went in doubt if such a thing there was.
<p/>And even now, though I seem three-parts along the road to it, I feel a cold fear often enough whether my way will stand all weathers.
<p/>It may break down yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not while your money lasts,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) answered with a short laugh.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) followed his (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) own thoughts in silence, and then spoke aloud again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Restless as the fox, and hungrier than ever he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) was.
<p/>Every man's hand against me, as I thought, and mine held out to every man; but they wouldn't see it.
<p/>None to come to my hearth willingly, though 'twas always hot for 'em; none to look into my meaning, though that meaning was always meant for kindness.
<p/>But who shall blame any living creature that they thought me an enemy and not a friend?
<p/>How should they know?
<p/>Didn't I hide the scant good that was in me, more careful than the bird her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nest?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They be up to your tricks now, anyway; and I've helped to show 'em better, though you may not believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Hacker/Hacker</b></font>)</div>declared Susan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a long-tongued, well-meaning female could do I've done for you; and I always shall say so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no good thing on earth than can't be made better, but one thing.
<p/>And that's the thing in all Christian minds this night--I mean the thing called love.
<p/>You know it--you deal in it.
<p/>Out of your kind soul you've always felt friendly to me, and you saw what I had the wish but not the power to show to others; and you've done your share of the work to make the people like me better.
<p/>Maybe 'tis mostly your doing, if we could but read into the truth of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Thunder</b></font>)</div><p/>This work-a-day world must for ever fall far short of the humblest ethical ideal, and doubtless even those who fell prostrate at the shout of their Thunder Spirit, or worshipped the sun and the sea in the morning of days, guessed dimly how their kind lacked much of perfection.
<p/>To them the brooding soul of humanity revealed the road, though little knew those early men the length of it; little they understood that the goal of any faultless standard must remain a shifting ideal within reach of mind alone.
<p/>At certain points Baskerville darkly suspected weak places in this new armour of light.
<p/>While his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) days had, indeed, achieved a consummation and orbicular completeness beyond all hope; while, looking backward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) could not fail to contrast noontide gloom with sunset light, the fierce equinox of autumn with this unfolding period of a gracious Indian summer now following upon it; yet, even here, there fell a narrow shadow of cloud; there wakened a wind not unedged.
<p/>In deep and secret thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had drifted upon that negation of justice involved by the Golden Rule.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) saw, what every intellect worthy a name must see: that to do as you would be done by, to withhold the scourge from the guilty shoulder, to suffer the weed to flourish in the garden, to shield our fellow-men from the consequence of their evil or folly, is to put the individual higher than society, and to follow a precept that ethics in evolution has long rejected.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) shirked his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) dilemma: he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) believed it not necessary to pursue the paradox to its bitter end.
<p/>The Golden Rule he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) hypostatised into a living and an omnipresent creed; henceforth it was destined to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) criterion of every action; and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) doubting spirit he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) replied, that if not practicable in youth, if not convenient for middle age, this principle might most justly direct the performance and stimulate the thought of the old.
<p/>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) was, and knew himself, untrue to the clearer, colder conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) reasoning past; but in practice this defection brought a peace so exalted, a content so steady, a recognition so precious, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) spirit upon it in faith and sought no further.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) retraced his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) time, and made a brief and pregnant summary thereof for Susan's ear.
<p/>'''Tis to be spoken in a score of words,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My life has been a storm in a teacup; but none the less a terrible storm for me until I won the grace to still it.
<p/>Port to the sailor-man be a blessed thing according to the voyage that's gone afore.
<p/>The worse that, the better the peace of the haven when he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) comes to it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was going to speak, but a sound on the stillness of night stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hark!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) said.
<p/>Together they rose and went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) outer door.
<p/>The gibbous moon sailed through a sky of thin cloud, and light fell dimly upon the open spaces, but sparkled in the great darkness of evergreen things about the garden.
<p/>Earth rolled night-hidden to the southern hills, and its breast was touched with sparks of flame, where glimmered those few habitations visible from this place.
<p/>A lattice of naked boughs meshed the moonlight under the slope of the hill, and from beneath their shadows ascended a moving thread of men and boys.
<p/>They broke the stillness with speech and laughter, and their red lantern-light struck to right and left and killed the wan moonshine as they came.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's toward now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Mr. Baskerville/Ned Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>asked Mr. Baskerville, staring blankly before him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Hacker/Hacker</b></font>)</div>cried Susan, '''tis the carol-singers without a doubt!
<p/>They'll want an ocean of beer presently, and where shall us get it from?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Coming to me--coming to sing to  me !''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) mumbled.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God, a thing far beyond my utmost thought is this!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The crowd rolled clattering up, and the woman stayed to welcome them; but the man ran back into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house, sat down in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair, bent forward to listen and clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands tightly between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees.
<p/>Acute emotion marked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countenance; but this painful tension passed when out of the night there rolled the melodious thunder of an ancient tune.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Singing for me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) murmured many times while the old song throbbed.
