And everybody but a sour and bitter man , like you , must have known it . Poor Mark is thrown over by a girl -- not to blame her , either , for she had to be true to herself . But still he wo n't believe that she 's not for him , though she 's put it plain as you please in writing ; and he goes on hoping and dreaming and building castles in the air . Always dreamy and queer at all times he was -- remember that . Then comes the crashing news for him that all is over and the maiden has taken another man . Was n't it enough to upset such a frail , fanciful creature ? Enough , and more than enough . He hides his trouble and his brain fails and his heart breaks -- all unseen by any eye . And then what happens ? He rings his own passing-bell ! Was that the work of a sane man ? Poor chap -- poor chap ! And you 'd deny him Christian burial and cast him here , like a dog , with the poor unnamed children down under . I blush for you . See to his mother 's grave and try and be larger-hearted .

Because , so soon as they were in his land , they found the spirit and wisdom of him working like barm in bread throughout the length and breadth of the place . They saw peace alive . They saw the people living in brotherly love and unity and understanding . They saw the religion of give and take at work .
