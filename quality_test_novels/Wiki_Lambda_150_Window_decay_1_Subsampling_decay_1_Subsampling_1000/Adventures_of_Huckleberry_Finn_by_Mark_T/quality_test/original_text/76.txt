finding civilized life confining his spirits are raised somewhat when tom sawyer helps him to escape one night past miss watson slave jim to meet up with tom gang of self proclaimed robbers
just as the gang activities begin to bore huck he is suddenly interrupted by the reappearance of his shiftless father pap an abusive alcoholic
knowing that pap would only spend the money on alcohol huck is successful in preventing pap from acquiring his fortune however pap kidnaps huck and leaves town with him
in illinois and on jackson island edit
pap forcibly moves huck to his isolated cabin in the woods along the illinois shoreline
because of pap drunken violence and imprisonment of huck inside the cabin huck during one of his father absences elaborately fakes his own death escapes from the cabin and sets off downriver
he settles comfortably on jackson island
here huck reunites with jim miss watson slave
jim has also run away after he overheard miss watson planning to sell him down the river to presumably more brutal owners
jim plans to make his way to the town of cairo in illinois free state so that he can later buy the rest of his enslaved family freedom
at first huck is conflicted about the sin and crime of supporting runaway slave but as the two talk in depth and bond over their mutually held superstitions huck emotionally connects with jim who increasingly becomes huck close friend and guardian
after heavy flooding on the river the two find raft which they keep as well as an entire house floating on the river chapter the house of death floats by
entering the house to seek loot jim finds the naked body of dead man lying on the floor shot in the back
he prevents huck from viewing the corpse

mrs loftus becomes increasingly suspicious that huck is boy finally proving it by series of tests
huck develops another story on the fly and explains his disguise as the only way to escape from an abusive foster family
once he is exposed she nevertheless allows him to leave her home without commotion not realizing that he is the allegedly murdered boy they have just been discussing
huck returns to jim to tell him the news and that search party is coming to jackson island that very night
the two hastily load up the raft and depart
after while huck and jim come across grounded steamship
searching it they stumble upon two thieves discussing murdering third but they flee before being noticed
they are later separated in fog making jim intensely anxious and when they reunite huck tricks jim into thinking he dreamed the entire incident
jim is not deceived for long and is deeply hurt that his friend should have teased him so mercilessly
huck becomes remorseful and apologizes to jim though his conscience troubles him about humbling himself to black man
in kentucky the grangerfords and shepherdsons edit
traveling onward huck and jim raft is struck by passing steamship again separating the two
huck is given shelter on the kentucky side of the river by the grangerfords an aristocratic family
he befriends buck grangerford boy about his age and learns that the grangerfords are engaged in year blood feud against another family the shepherdsons
the grangerfords and shepherdsons go to the same church which ironically preaches brotherly love
the vendetta finally comes to head when buck older sister elopes with member of the shepherdson clan
in the resulting conflict all the grangerford males from this branch of the family are shot and killed including buck whose horrific murder huck witnesses
he is immensely relieved to be reunited with jim who has since recovered and repaired the raft
in arkansas the duke and the king edit
near the arkansas missouri tennessee border jim and huck take two on the run grifters aboard the raft
the younger man who is about thirty introduces himself as the long lost son of an english duke the duke of bridgewater
the older one about seventy then trumps this outrageous claim by alleging that he himself is the lost dauphin the son of louis xvi and rightful king of france
the duke and king soon become permanent passengers on jim and huck raft committing series of confidence schemes upon unsuspecting locals all along their journey
to divert suspicions from the public away from jim they pose him as recaptured slave runaway but later paint him up entirely blue and call him the sick arab so that he can move about the raft without bindings
on one occasion the swindlers advertise three night engagement of play called the royal nonesuch
the play turns out to be only couple of minutes worth of an absurd bawdy sham
on the afternoon of the first performance drunk called boggs is shot dead by gentleman named colonel sherburn lynch mob forms to retaliate against sherburn and sherburn surrounded at his home disperses the mob by making defiant speech describing how true lynching should be done
by the third night of the royal nonesuch the townspeople prepare for their revenge on the duke and king for their money making scam but the two cleverly skip town together with huck and jim just before the performance begins
in the next town the two swindlers then impersonate brothers of peter wilks recently deceased man of property
to match accounts of wilks brothers the king attempts an english accent and the duke pretends to be deaf mute while starting to collect wilks inheritance
huck decides that wilks three orphaned nieces who treat huck with kindness do not deserve to be cheated thus and so he tries to retrieve for them the stolen inheritance
in desperate moment huck is forced to hide the money in wilks coffin which is abruptly buried the next morning
the arrival of two new men who seem to be the real brothers throws everything into confusion so that the townspeople decide to dig up the coffin in order to determine which are the true brothers but with everyone else distracted huck leaves for the raft hoping to never see the duke and king again
suddenly though the two villains return much to huck despair
when huck is finally able to get away second time he finds to his horror that the swindlers have sold jim away to family that intends to return him to his proper owner for the reward
defying his conscience and accepting the negative religious consequences he expects for his actions all right then ll go to hell
huck resolves to free jim once and for all
huck learns that jim is being held at the plantation of silas and sally phelps
the family nephew tom is expected for visit at the same time as huck arrival so huck is mistaken for tom and welcomed into their home
he plays along hoping to find jim location and free him in surprising plot twist it is revealed that the expected nephew is in fact tom sawyer
when huck intercepts the real tom sawyer on the road and tells him everything tom decides to join huck scheme pretending to be his own younger half brother sid while huck continues pretending to be tom
in the meantime jim has told the family about the two grifters and the new plan for the royal nonesuch and so the townspeople capture the duke and king who are then tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on rail
rather than simply sneaking jim out of the shed where he is being held tom develops an elaborate plan to free him involving secret messages hidden tunnel snakes in shed rope ladder sent in jim food and other elements from adventure books he has read including an anonymous note to the phelps warning them of the whole scheme
during the actual escape and resulting pursuit tom is shot in the leg while jim remains by his side risking recapture rather than completing his escape alone
although local doctor admires jim decency he has jim arrested in his sleep and returned to the phelps
after this events quickly resolve themselves
tom aunt polly arrives and reveals huck and tom true identities to the phelps family
jim is revealed to be free man miss watson died two months earlier and freed jim in her will but tom who already knew this chose not to reveal this information to huck so that he could come up with an artful rescue plan for jim
jim tells huck that huck father pap finn has been dead for some time he was the dead man they found earlier in the floating house and so huck may now return safely to st petersburg
huck declares that he is quite glad to be done writing his story and despite sally plans to adopt and civilize him he intends to flee west to indian territory
adventures of huckleberry finn explores themes of race and identity
a complexity exists concerning jim character
while some scholars point out that jim is good hearted moral and he is not unintelligent in contrast to several of the more negatively depicted white characters others have criticized the novel as racist citing the use of the word nigger and emphasizing the stereotypically comic treatment of jim lack of education superstition and ignorance
throughout the story huck is in moral conflict with the received values of the society in which he lives and while he is unable to consciously refute those values even in his thoughts he makes moral choice based on his own valuation of jim friendship and jim human worth decision in direct opposition to the things he has been taught
mark twain in his lecture notes proposes that sound heart is surer guide than an ill trained conscience and goes on to describe the novel as book of mine where sound heart and deformed conscience come into collision and conscience suffers defeat
to highlight the hypocrisy required to condone slavery within an ostensibly moral system twain has huck father enslave his son isolate him and beat him
when huck escapes he then immediately encounters jim illegally doing the same thing
the treatments both of them receive are radically different especially with an encounter with mrs judith loftus who takes pity on who she presumes to be runaway apprentice huck yet boasts about her husband sending the hounds after runaway slave jim
some scholars discuss huck own character and the novel itself in the context of its relation to african american culture as whole
john alberti quotes shelley fisher fishkin who writes in her book was huck black
mark twain and african american voices by limiting their field of inquiry to the periphery white scholars have missed the ways in which african american voices shaped twain creative imagination at its core
it is suggested that the character of huckleberry finn illustrates the correlation and even interrelatedness between white and black culture in the united states
the original illustrations were done by w
kemble at the time young artist working for life magazine
kemble was hand picked by twain who admired his work
hearn suggests that twain and kemble had similar skill writing that
whatever he may have lacked in technical grace kemble shared with the greatest illustrators the ability to give even the minor individual in text his own distinct visual personality just as twain so deftly defined full rounded character in few phrases so too did kemble depict with few strokes of his pen that same entire personage
as kemble could afford only one model most of his illustrations produced for the book were done by guesswork
when the novel was published the illustrations were praised even as the novel was harshly criticized
kemble produced another set of illustrations for harper and the american publishing company in and after twain lost the copyright
publication effect on literary climate edit
twain initially conceived of the work as sequel to the adventures of tom sawyer that would follow huckleberry finn through adulthood
beginning with few pages he had removed from the earlier novel twain began work on manuscript he originally titled huckleberry finn autobiography
twain worked on the manuscript off and on for the next several years ultimately abandoning his original plan of following huck development into adulthood
he appeared to have lost interest in the manuscript while it was in progress and set it aside for several years
after making trip down the hudson river twain returned to his work on the novel
upon completion the novel title closely paralleled its predecessor adventures of huckleberry finn tom sawyer comrade
mark twain composed the story in pen on notepaper between and
paul needham who supervised the authentication of the manuscript for sotheby books and manuscripts department in new york in stated what you see is clemens attempt to move away from pure literary writing to dialect writing
for example twain revised the opening line of huck finn three times
he initially wrote you will not know about me which he changed to you do not know about me before settling on the final version you don know about me without you have read book by the name of the adventures of tom sawyer but that ain no matter
the revisions also show how twain reworked his material to strengthen the characters of huck and jim as well as his sensitivity to the then current debate over literacy and voting
a later version was the first typewritten manuscript delivered to printer
demand for the book spread outside of the united states
adventures of huckleberry finn was eventually published on december in canada and the united kingdom and on february in the united states
the illustration on page became point of issue after an engraver whose identity was never discovered made last minute addition to the printing plate of kemble picture of old silas phelps which drew attention to phelps groin
thirty thousand copies of the book had been printed before the obscenity was discovered
a new plate was made to correct the illustration and repair the existing copies
in the buffalo public library curator james fraser gluck approached twain to donate the manuscript to the library
later it was believed that half of the pages had been misplaced by the printer
in the missing first half turned up in steamer trunk owned by descendants of gluck
the library successfully claimed possession and in opened the mark twain room to showcase the treasure
in relation to the literary climate at the time of the book publication in henry nash smith describes the importance of mark twain already established reputation as professional humorist having already published over dozen other works
smith suggests that while the dismantling of the decadent romanticism of the later nineteenth century was necessary operation adventures of huckleberry finn illustrated previously inaccessible resources of imaginative power but also made vernacular language with its new sources of pleasure and new energy available for american prose and poetry in the twentieth century
critical reception and banning edit
in this scene illustrated by w kemble jim has given huck up for dead and when he reappears thinks he must be ghost
while it was clear that the publication of adventures of huckleberry finn was controversial from the outset norman mailer writing in the new york times in concluded that twain novel was not initially too unpleasantly regarded
in fact mailer writes the critical climate could hardly anticipate s eliot and ernest hemingway encomiums years later reviews that would remain longstanding in the american consciousness
alberti suggests that the academic establishment responded to the book challenges both dismissively and with confusion
during twain time and today defenders of adventures of huckleberry finn lump all nonacademic critics of the book together as extremists and censors thus equating the complaints about the book coarseness from the genteel bourgeois trustees of the concord public library in the with more recent objections based on race and civil rights
upon issue of the american edition in several libraries banned it from their shelves
the early criticism focused on what was perceived as the book crudeness
one incident was recounted in the newspaper the boston transcript
public library committee has decided to exclude mark twain latest book from the library
one member of the committee says that while he does not wish to call it immoral he thinks it contains but little humor and that of very coarse type
he regards it as the veriest trash
the library and the other members of the committee entertain similar views characterizing it as rough coarse and inelegant dealing with series of experiences not elevating the whole book being more suited to the slums than to intelligent respectable people
writer louisa may alcott criticized the book publication as well saying that if twain could not think of something better to tell our pure minded lads and lasses he had best stop writing for them
twain later remarked to his editor apparently the concord library has condemned huck as trash and only suitable for the slums
this will sell us another twenty five thousand copies for sure
in new york brooklyn public library also banned the book due to bad word choice and huck having not only itched but scratched within the novel which was considered obscene
when asked by brooklyn librarian about the situation twain sardonically replied am greatly troubled by what you say
i wrote tom sawyer huck finn for adults exclusively it always distressed me when find that boys and girls have been allowed access to them
the mind that becomes soiled in youth can never again be washed clean
i know this by my own experience to this day cherish an unappeased bitterness against the unfaithful guardians of my young life who not only permitted but compelled me to read an unexpurgated bible through before was years old
none can do that and ever draw clean sweet breath again on this side of the grave
many subsequent critics ernest hemingway among them have deprecated the final chapters claiming the book devolves into little more than minstrel show satire and broad comedy after jim is detained
although hemingway declared all modern american literature comes from huck finn and hailed it as the best book we ve had he cautioned if you must read it you must stop where the nigger jim is stolen from the boys sic
pulitzer prize winner ron powers states in his twain biography mark twain life that huckleberry finn endures as consensus masterpiece despite these final chapters in which tom sawyer leads huck through elaborate machinations to rescue jim
in his introduction to the annotated huckleberry finn michael patrick hearn writes that twain could be uninhibitedly vulgar and quotes critic william dean howells twain contemporary who wrote that the author humor was not for most women
however hearn continues by explaining that the reticent howells found nothing in the proofs of huckleberry finn so offensive that it needed to be struck out
much of modern scholarship of huckleberry finn has focused on its treatment of race
many twain scholars have argued that the book by humanizing jim and exposing the fallacies of the racist assumptions of slavery is an attack on racism
others have argued that the book falls short on this score especially in its depiction of jim
according to professor stephen railton of the university of virginia twain was unable to fully rise above the stereotypes of black people that white readers of his era expected and enjoyed and therefore resorted to minstrel show style comedy to provide humor at jim expense and ended up confirming rather than challenging late th century racist stereotypes
in one instance the controversy caused drastically altered interpretation of the text in cbs tried to avoid controversial material in televised version of the book by deleting all mention of slavery and omitting the character of jim entirely
because of this controversy over whether huckleberry finn is racist or anti racist and because the word nigger is frequently used in the novel commonly used word in twain time which has since become vulgar and taboo many have questioned the appropriateness of teaching the book in the s public school system this questioning of the word nigger is illustrated by school administrator of virginia in calling the novel the most grotesque example of racism ve ever seen in my life
according to the american library association huckleberry finn was the fifth most frequently challenged book in the united states during the
there have been several more recent cases involving protests for the banning of the novel
in high school student calista phair and her grandmother beatrice clark in renton washington proposed banning the book from classroom learning in the renton school district though not from any public libraries because of the word nigger
clark filed request with the school district in response to the required reading of the book asking for the novel to be removed from the english curriculum
the two curriculum committees that considered her request eventually decided to keep the novel on the th grade curriculum though they suspended it until panel had time to review the novel and set specific teaching procedure for the novel controversial topics
in washington state high school teacher called for the removal of the novel from school curriculum
the teacher john foley called for replacing adventures of huckleberry finn with more modern novel
in an opinion column that foley wrote in the seattle post intelligencer he states that all novels that use the word repeatedly need to go
he states that teaching the novel is not only unnecessary but difficult due to the offensive language within the novel with many students becoming uncomfortable at just hear ing the word
he views this change as common sense with obama election into office as sign that americans are ready for change and that by removing these books from the reading lists they would be following this change
in adventures of huckleberry finn was removed from public school district in virginia along with the novel to kill mockingbird due to their use of racial slurs
publishers have made their own attempts at easing the controversy by way of releasing editions of the book with the word nigger replaced by less controversial words
a edition of the book published by newsouth books employed the word slave although being incorrectly addressed to freed man and did not use the term injun
mark twain scholar alan gribben said he hoped the edition would be more friendly for use in classrooms rather than have the work banned outright from classroom reading lists due to its language
according to publisher suzanne la rosa at newsouth we saw the value in an edition that would help the works find new readers
if the publication sparks good debate about how language impacts learning or about the nature of censorship or the way in which racial slurs exercise their baneful influence then our mission in publishing this new edition of twain works will be more emphatically fulfilled
another scholar thomas wortham criticized the changes saying the new edition doesn challenge children to ask why would child like huck use such reprehensible language
two similarly expurged editions of the book were published in
the hipster huckleberry finn employed the word hipster
the adventures of huckleberry finn robotic edition employed the word robot and included modified illustrations in which jim was replaced with robot character
