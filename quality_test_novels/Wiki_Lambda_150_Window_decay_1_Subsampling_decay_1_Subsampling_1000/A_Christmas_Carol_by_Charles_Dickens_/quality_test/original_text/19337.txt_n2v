dickens at the blacking warehouse as envisioned by fred barnard
the writer charles dickens was born to middle class family which got into financial difficulties as result of the spendthrift nature of his father john
in john was committed to the marshalsea debtors prison in southwark london
dickens aged was forced to pawn his collection of books leave school and work at dirty and rat infested shoe blacking factory
the change in circumstances gave him what his biographer michael slater describes as deep personal and social outrage which heavily influenced his writing and outlook
by the end of dickens was well established author having written six major works as well as several short stories novellas and other pieces
on december that year he began publishing his novel martin chuzzlewit as monthly serial the novel was his favourite work but sales were disappointing and he faced temporary financial difficulties
celebrating the christmas season had been growing in popularity through the victorian era
the christmas tree had been introduced in britain during the th century and its use was popularised by queen victoria and prince albert
their practice was copied in many homes across the country
in the early th century there had been revival of interest in christmas carols following decline in popularity over the previous hundred years
the publication of davies gilbert work some ancient christmas carols with the tunes to which they were formerly sung in the west of england and william sandys collection christmas carols ancient and modern led to growth in the form popularity in britain
dickens had an interest in christmas and his first story on the subject was christmas festivities published in bell weekly messenger in the story was then published as christmas dinner in sketches by boz
the story of the goblins who stole sexton another christmas story appeared in the novel the pickwick papers
in the episode mr wardle relates the tale of gabriel grub lonely and mean spirited sexton who undergoes christmas conversion after being visited by goblins who show him the past and future
slater considers that the main elements of the carol are present in the story but not yet in firm form
the story is followed by passage about christmas in dickens editorial master humphrey clock
the professor of english literature paul davis writes that although the goblins story appears to be prototype of christmas carol all dickens earlier writings about christmas influenced the story
dickens was not the first author to celebrate the christmas season in literature
among earlier authors who influenced dickens was washington irving whose work the sketch book of geoffrey crayon gent
included four essays on old english christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at aston hall near birmingham
the tales and essays attracted dickens and the two authors shared the belief that the staging of nostalgic english christmas might help restore the social harmony that they felt had been lost in the modern world
several works may have had an influence on the writing of christmas carol including two douglas jerrold essays one from an issue of punch how mr chokepear keeps merry christmas and one from the beauties of the police
more broadly dickens was influenced by fairy tales and nursery stories which he closely associated with christmas because he saw them as stories of conversion and transformation
charles dickens in the year before the publication of christmas carol
dickens was touched by the lot of poor children in the middle decades of the th century
in early he toured the cornish tin mines where he was angered by seeing children working in appalling conditions
the suffering he witnessed there was reinforced by visit to the field lane ragged school one of several london schools set up for the education of the capital half starved illiterate street children
in february the second report of the children employment commission was published
it was parliamentary report exposing the effects of the industrial revolution upon working class children
horrified by what he read dickens planned to publish an inexpensive political pamphlet tentatively titled an appeal to the people of england on behalf of the poor man child but changed his mind deferring the pamphlet production until the end of the year
in march he wrote to dr southwood smith one of the four commissioners responsible for the second report about his change in plans you will certainly feel that sledge hammer has come down with twenty tiny_times the force twenty thousand tiny_times the force could exert by following out my first idea
in fundraising speech on october at the manchester athenaeum dickens urged workers and employers to join together to combat ignorance with educational reform and realised in the days following that the most effective way to reach the broadest segment of the population with his social concerns about poverty and injustice was to write deeply felt christmas narrative rather than polemical pamphlets and essays
john leech illustrator of the first edition
by mid dickens began to suffer from financial problems
sales of martin chuzzlewit were falling off and his wife catherine was pregnant with their fifth child
matters worsened when chapman hall his publishers threatened to reduce his monthly income by if sales dropped further
he began christmas carol in october
michael slater dickens biographer describes the book as being written at white heat it was completed in six weeks the final pages being written in early december
he built much of the work in his head while taking night tiny_time walks of to miles to km around london
dickens sister in law wrote how he wept and laughed and wept again and excited himself in most extraordinary manner in composition
slater says that christmas carol was
intended to open its readers hearts towards those struggling to survive on the lower rungs of the economic ladder and to encourage practical benevolence but also to warn of the terrible danger to society created by the toleration of widespread ignorance and actual want among the poor
george cruikshank the illustrator who had earlier worked with dickens on sketches by boz and oliver twist introduced him to the caricaturist john leech
by october dickens invited leech to work on christmas carol and four hand coloured etchings and four black and white wood engravings by the artist accompanied the text
dickens hand written manuscript of the story does not include the sentence in the penultiny_timate paragraph and to tiny_tiny_tim who did not die this was added later during the printing process
john elwes also called john the miser one of the models for scrooge
the central character of christmas carol is ebenezer scrooge miserly london based moneylender described in the story as squeezing wrenching grasping scraping clutching covetous old sinner
kelly writes that scrooge may have been influenced by dickens conflicting feelings for his father whom he both loved and demonised
this psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different scrooges in the tale one cold stingy and greedy semi recluse the other benevolent sociable man
robert douglas fairhurst the professor of english literature considers that in the opening part of the book covering young scrooge lonely and unhappy childhood and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty is something of self parody of dickens fears about himself the post transformation parts of the book are how dickens optiny_timistically sees himself
scrooge could also be based on two misers the eccentric john elwes mp or jemmy wood the owner of the gloucester old bank and also known as the gloucester miser
according to the sociologist frank elwell scrooge views on the poor are reflection of those of the demographer and political economist thomas malthus while the miser questions are there no prisons
the treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour then
are reflection of sarcastic question raised by the philosopher thomas carlyle are there not treadmills gibbets even hospitals poor rates new poor law
there are literary precursors for scrooge in dickens own works
peter ackroyd dickens biographer sees similarities between the character and the elder martin chuzzlewit character although the miser is more fantastic image than the chuzzlewit patriarch ackroyd observes that chuzzlewit transformation to charitable figure is parallel to that of the miser
douglas fairhurst sees that the minor character gabriel grub from the pickwick papers was also an influence when creating scrooge
scrooge name came from tombstone dickens had seen on visit to edinburgh
the grave was for ebenezer lennox scroggie whose job was given as meal man corn merchant dickens misread the inscription as mean man
when dickens was young he lived near tradesman premises with the sign goodge and marney which may have provided the name for scrooge former business partner
for the chained marley dickens drew on his memory of visit to the western penitentiary in pittsburgh pennsylvania in march where he saw and was affected by seeing fettered prisoners
for the character tiny_tiny_tim dickens used his nephew henry disabled boy who was five at the tiny_time christmas carol was written
the two figures of want and ignorance sheltering in the robes of the ghost of christmas present were inspired by the children dickens had seen on his visit to ragged school in the east end of london
ignorance and want from the original edition
the transformation of scrooge is central to the story
davis considers scrooge to be protean figure always in process of reformation kelly writes that the transformation is reflected in the description of scrooge who begins as two dimensional character but who then grows into one who possess es an emotional depth and regret for lost opportunities
some writers including grace moore the dickens scholar consider that there is christian theme running through christmas carol and that the novella should be seen as an allegory of the christian concept of redemption
dickens biographer claire tomalin sees the conversion of scrooge as carrying the christian message that even the worst of sinners may repent and become good man
dickens attitudes towards organised religion were complex he based his beliefs and principles on the new testament
dickens statement that marley had no bowels is reference to the bowels of compassion mentioned in the first epistle of john the reason for his eternal damnation
other writers including kelly consider that dickens put forward secular vision of this sacred holiday
the dickens scholar john jordan argues that christmas carol shows what dickens referred to in letter to his friend john forster as his carol philosophy cheerful views sharp anatomisation of humbug jolly good temper and vein of glowing hearty generous mirthful beaming reference in everything to home and fireside
from secular viewpoint the cultural historian penne restad suggests that scrooge redemption underscores the conservative individualistic and patriarchal aspects of dickens carol philosophy of charity and altruism
dickens wrote christmas carol in response to british social attitudes towards poverty particularly child poverty and wished to use the novella as means to put forward his arguments against it
the story shows scrooge as paradigm for self interest and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor especially children in poverty personified by the allegorical figures of want and ignorance
the two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers as was tiny_tiny_tim
douglas fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed dickens to present his message of the need for charity without alienating his largely middle class readership
first edition frontispiece and title page
as the result of the disagreements with chapman and hall over the commercial failures of martin chuzzlewit dickens arranged to pay for the publishing himself in exchange for percentage of the profits
production of christmas carol was not without problems
the first printing contained drab olive endpapers that dickens felt were unacceptable and the publisher chapman and hall quickly replaced them with yellow endpapers but once replaced those clashed with the title page which was then redone
the final product was bound in red cloth with gilt edged pages completed only two days before the publication date of december
following publication dickens arranged for the manuscript to be bound in red morocco leather and presented as gift to his solicitor thomas mitton
priced at five shillings equal to in pounds the first run of copies sold out by christmas eve
chapman and hall issued second and third editions before the new year and the book continued to sell well into
by the end of eleven more editions had been released
since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions translated into several languages and has never been out of print
it was dickens most popular book in the united states and sold over two million copies in the hundred years following its first publication there
the high production costs upon which dickens insisted led to reduced profits and the first edition brought him only equal to in pounds rather than the equal to in pounds he expected
year later the profits were only and dickens was deeply disappointed
he wrote that christmas carol was national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it personal kindness
according to douglas fairhurst contemporary reviews of christmas carol were almost uniformly kind
the illustrated london news described how the story impressive eloquence its unfeigned lightness of heart its playful and sparkling humour its gentle spirit of humanity all put the reader in good humour with ourselves with each other with the season and with the author
the critic from the athenaeum the literary magazine considered it tale to make the reader laugh and cry to open his hands and open his heart to charity even toward the uncharitable dainty dish to set before king
william makepeace thackeray writing in fraser magazine described the book as national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it personal kindness
the last two people heard speak of it were women neither knew the other or the author and both said by way of criticism god bless him
the poet thomas hood in his own journal wrote that if christmas with its ancient and hospitable customs its social and charitable observances were ever in danger of decay this is the book that would give them new lease
the reviewer for tait edinburgh magazine theodore martin who was usually critical of dickens work spoke well of christmas carol noting it was noble book finely felt and calculated to work much social good
after dickens death margaret oliphant deplored the turkey and plum pudding aspects of the book but admitted that in the days of its first publication it was regarded as new gospel and noted that the book was unique in that it made people behave better
the religious press generally ignored the tale but in january christian remembrancer thought the tale old and hackneyed subject was treated in an original way and praised the author sense of humour and pathos
the writer and social thinker john ruskin told friend that he thought dickens had taken the religion from christmas and had imagined it as mistletoe and pudding neither resurrection from the dead nor rising of new stars nor teaching of wise men nor shepherds
the new monthly magazine praised the story but thought the book physical excesses the gilt edges and expensive binding kept the price high making it unavailable to the poor
the review recommended that the tale should be printed on cheap paper and priced accordingly
an unnamed writer for the westminster review mocked dickens grasp of economics asking who went without turkey and punch in order that bob might get them for unless there were turkeys and punch in surplus someone must go without
following criticism of the us in american notes and martin chuzzlewit american readers were less enthusiastic at first but by the end of the american civil war copies of the book were in wide circulation
in the new york tiny_times published an enthusiastic review noting that the author brought the old christmas of bygone centuries and remote manor houses into the living rooms of the poor of today
the ghost of christmas present from the original edition
in january parley illuminated library published an unauthorised version of the story in condensed form which they sold for twopence
i have not the least doubt that if these vagabonds can be stopped they must
let us be the sledge hammer in this or shall be beset by hundreds of the same crew when come out with long story
the publishers declared themselves bankrupt and dickens was left to pay in costs
the small profits dickens earned from christmas carol further strained his relationship with his publishers and he broke with them in favour of bradbury and evans who had been printing his works to that point
dickens returned to the tale several tiny_times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation
he capitalised on the success of the book by publishing other christmas stories the chimes the cricket on the hearth the battle of life and the haunted man and the ghost bargain these were secular conversion tales which acknowledged the progressive societal changes of the previous year and highlighted those social problems which still needed to be addressed
while the public eagerly bought the later books the reviewers were highly critical of the stories
performances and adaptations edit
main article adaptations of christmas carol
by dickens was engaged with david copperfield and had neither the tiny_time nor the inclination to produce another christmas book
he decided the best way to reach his audience with his carol philosophy was by public readings
during christmas dickens gave reading in birmingham town hall to the industrial and literary institute the performance was great success
thereafter he read the tale in an abbreviated version tiny_times until the year of his death including at his farewell performance
play media first film adaptation scrooge or marley ghost
in the years following the book publication responses to the tale were published by m swepstone christmas shadows horatio alger job warner christmas louisa may alcott christmas dream and how it came true and others who followed scrooge life as reformed man or some who thought dickens had got it wrong and needed to be corrected
the novella was adapted for the stage almost immediately
three productions opened on february one by edward stirling being sanctioned by dickens and running for more than nights
by the close of february eight rival christmas carol theatrical productions were playing in london
the story has been adapted for film and television more than any of dickens other works
in it was produced as scrooge or marley ghost silent black and white british film it was one of the first known adaptations of dickens work on film but it is now largely lost
the story was adapted in for bbc radio
the story has been adapted to other media including opera ballet broadway musical animation and bbc mime production starring marcel marceau
davis considers the adaptations have become better remembered than the original
some of dickens scenes such as visiting the miners and lighthouse keepers have been forgotten by many while other events often added such as scrooge visiting the bobs on christmas day are now thought by many to be part of the original story
accordingly davis distinguishes between the original text and the remembered version
the phrase merry christmas had been around for many years the earliest known written use was in letter in but dickens use of the phrase in christmas carol popularised it among the victorian public
entered popular use in the english language as retort to anything sentiny_timental or overly festive the name scrooge became used as designation for miser and was added to the oxford english dictionary as such in
scrooge extinguishing the first spirit
in the early th century the celebration of christmas was associated in britain with the countryside and peasant revels disconnected to the increasing urbanisation and industrialisation taking place
davis considers that in christmas carol dickens showed that christmas could be celebrated in towns and cities despite increasing modernisation
the modern observance of christmas is largely the result of mid victorian revival of the holiday
the oxford movement of the and had produced resurgence of the traditional rituals and religious observances associated with christmastide and with christmas carol dickens captured the zeitgeist while he reflected and reinforced his vision of christmas
dickens advocated humanitarian focus of the holiday which influenced several aspects of christmas that are still celebrated in western culture such as family gatherings seasonal food and drink dancing games and festive generosity of spirit
the historian ronald hutton writes that dickens linked worship and feasting within context of social reconciliation
the novelist william dean howells analysing several of dickens christmas stories including christmas carol considered that by the pathos appears false and strained the humor largely horseplay the characters theatrical the joviality pumped the psychology commonplace the sociology alone funny
the writer james joyce considered that dickens took childish approach with christmas carol to produce gap between the naïve optiny_timism of the story and the realities of life at the tiny_time
ruth glancy professor of english literature states that the largest impact of christmas carol was the influence felt by individual readers
in early the gentleman magazine attributed rise of charitable giving in britain to dickens novella in robert louis stevenson after reading dickens christmas books vowed to give generously to those in need and thomas carlyle expressed generous hospitality by hosting two christmas dinners after reading the book
in one american businessman was so moved by attending reading that he closed his factory on christmas day and sent every employee turkey while in the early years of the th century maud of wales the queen of norway sent gifts to london crippled children signed with tiny_tiny_tim love
on the novella the author k chesterton wrote the beauty and blessing of the story lie in the great furnace of real happiness that glows through scrooge and everything around him
whether the christmas visions would or would not convert scrooge they convert us
davis analysing the changes made to adaptations over tiny_time sees changes to the focus of the story and its characters to reflect mainstream thinking of the period
while dickens victorian audiences would have viewed the tale as spiritual but secular parable in the early th century it became children story read by parents who remembered their parents reading it when they were younger
in the lead up to and during the great depression davis identifies that while some see the story as denunciation of capitalism most read it as way to escape oppressive economic realities
the film versions of the were different in the uk and us
british made films showed traditional telling of the story while us made works showed bob in more central role escaping the depression caused by european bankers and celebrating what davis calls the christmas of the common man
in the scrooge was sometiny_times portrayed as freudian figure wrestling with his past
by the he was again set in world of depression and economic uncertainty
these were sketches by boz the pickwick papers nicholas nickleby oliver twist the old curiosity shop and barnaby rudge
serialisation was in parts which concluded on june
the addition of the line has proved contentious to some
one writer in the dickensian the journal of the dickens fellowship wrote in that the fate of tiny_tiny_tim should be matter of dignified reticence dickens was carried away by exuberance and momentarily forgot good taste
carlyle original question was written in his work chartism
grub name came from th century dutch miser gabriel de graaf morose gravedigger
scroggie was unlike scrooge in nature and was described as well known hedonist who loved wine women and parties dandy and terrible philanderer who had several sexual liaisons which made him the talk of the town jovial and kindly man
henry was also used as the basis for paul dombey jr in dombey and son
others who have examined the christian theme include geoffrey rowell claire tomalin and martin sable
the author k chesterton wrote of dickens religious views that the tone of dickens towards religion though like that of most of his contemporaries philosophically disturbed and rather historically ignorant had an element that was very characteristic of himself
he had all the prejudices of his tiny_time
he had for instance that dislike of defined dogmas which really means preference for unexamined dogmas
dickens stated that have always striven in my writings to express the veneration for the life and lessons of our saviour
the full verse of john is but whoso hath this world good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of god in him
in mitton sold the manuscript to the bookseller francis harvey reportedly for equal to in pounds who sold it to the autograph collector henry george churchill in in turn churchill sold the manuscript to bennett birmingham bookseller
bennett sold it for to robson and kerslake of london which sold it to dickens collector stuart samuel for
it was purchased by pierpont morgan for an undisclosed sum and is now held by the pierpont morgan library new york
dickens biographer claire tomalin puts the first edition profits at and those by the end of at
the parley version was titled christmas ghost story reoriginated from the original by charles dickens esquire and analytically condensed for this work
one example of this was the introduction of turkey as the main meat of the christmas meal
in britain the tradition had been to eat roast goose but change to turkey followed the publication of the book
by mrs beeton in her book of household management advised her readers that christmas dinner with the middle class of this empire would scarcely be christmas dinner without its turkey
