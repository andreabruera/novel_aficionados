literary significance and criticism
on christmas eve an unnamed narrator listens to douglas friend read manuscript written by former governess whom douglas claims to have known and who is now dead
the manuscript tells the story of how the young governess is hired by man who has become responsible for his young nephew and niece after the deaths of their parents
he lives mainly in london but also has country house bly
he is uninterested in raising the children
the boy miles is attending boarding school while his younger sister flora is living in summer country house in essex
she is currently being cared for by mrs_grose the housekeeper
miles and flora uncle the governess new employer gives her full charge of the children and explicitly states that she is not to bother him with communications of any sort
the governess travels to her new employer country house and begins her duties
miles soon returns from school for the summer just after letter arrives from the headmaster stating that he has been expelled
miles never speaks of the matter and the governess is hesitant to raise the issue
she fears there is some horrible secret behind the expulsion but is too charmed by the adorable young boy to want to press the issue
soon thereafter around the grounds of the estate the governess begins to see the figures of man and woman whom she does not recognize
these figures come and go at will without ever being seen or challenged by other members of the household and they seem to the governess to be supernatural
she learns from mrs_grose that the governess predecessor miss_jessel and another employee quint had had sexual relationship
before their deaths jessel and quint spent much of their time with flora and miles and this fact has grim significance for the current governess when she becomes convinced that the two children are secretly aware of the ghosts presence
later without permission flora leaves the house while miles is playing music for the governess
the governess notices flora absence and goes with mrs_grose in search of her
they find her in folly on the shore of the lake and the governess is convinced that flora has been talking to the ghost of miss_jessel
when the governess finally confronts flora the girl denies seeing miss_jessel and demands never to see the governess again
at the governess suggestion mrs_grose takes flora away to her uncle leaving the governess with miles who that night at last talks to her about his expulsion the ghost of quint appears to the governess at the window
the governess shields miles who attempts to see the ghost
the governess tells miles he is no longer controlled by the ghost and then finds that miles has died in her arms and the ghost has gone
throughout his career james was attracted to the ghost story
however he was not fond of literature stereotypical ghosts
he preferred to create ghosts that were eerie extensions of everyday reality the strange and sinister embroidered on the very type of the normal and easy as he put it in the new york edition preface to his final ghost story the jolly corner
with the turn of the screw many critics have wondered if the strange and sinister were only in the governess mind and not part of reality
the result has been longstanding critical dispute about the reality of the ghosts and the sanity of the governess
beyond the dispute critics have closely examined james narrative technique for the story
the framing introduction and subsequent first person narrative by the governess have been studied by theorists of fiction interested in the power of fictional narratives to convince or even manipulate readers
the imagery of the turn of the screw is reminiscent of gothic fiction
the emphasis on old and mysterious buildings throughout the novella reinforces this motif
james also relates the amount of light present in various scenes to the strength of the supernatural or ghostly forces apparently at work
the governess refers directly to the mysteries of udolpho and indirectly to jane eyre evoking comparison of the governess not only to the character of jane eyre but also to the character of bertha the madwoman confined in thornfield
literary significance and criticism edit
oliver elton wrote in that there is doubt raised and kept hanging whether after all the two ghosts who can choose to which persons they will appear are facts or delusions of the young governess who tells the story
edmund wilson was another of the earlier proponents of the theory questioning the governess sanity positing sexual repression as cause for her experiences
wilson eventually recanted his opinion after considering the governess point by point description of quint
then john silver pointed out hints in the story that the governess might have gained previous knowledge of quint appearance in non supernatural ways
this induced wilson to return to his original opinion that the governess was delusional and that the ghosts existed only in her imagination
william veeder sees miles eventual death as induced by the governess
in complex psychoanalytic reading veeder concludes that the governess expressed her repressed rage toward her father and toward the master of bly on miles
other critics however have strongly defended the governess
they note that james letters his new york edition preface and his notebooks contain no definite evidence that the turn of the screw was intended as anything other than straightforward ghost story and james certainly wrote ghost stories that did not depend on the narrator imagination
for example owen wingrave includes ghost that causes its title character sudden death although no one actually sees it
james notebooks entry indicates that he was inspired originally by tale he heard from edward white benson the archbishop of canterbury
there are indications that the story james was told was about an incident in hinton ampner where in woman named mary ricketts moved from her home after seeing the apparitions of man and woman day and night staring through the windows bending over the beds and making her feel her children were in danger
in commentary in the new yorker brad leithauser has given his own perspective on the different interpretations of james novella all such attempts to solve the book however admiringly tendered unwittingly work toward its diminution its profoundest pleasure lies in the beautifully fussed over way in which james refuses to come down on either side the book becomes modest monument to the bold pursuit of ambiguity
according to leithauser the reader is meant to entertain both the proposition that the governess is mad and the proposition that the ghosts really do exist and consider the dreadful implications of each
poet and literary critic craig raine in his essay sex in nineteenth century literature states quite categorically his belief that victorian readers would have identified the two ghosts as child molesters
the turn of the screw was first published in the magazine collier weekly serialised in instalments january april

the next night by the corner of the hearth in the best chair douglas began to read
he did stand there but high up beyond the lawn and at the very top of the tower
holding my candle high till came within sight of the tall window
he presently produced something that made me drop straight down on the stone slab
must have thrown myself on my face on the ground
